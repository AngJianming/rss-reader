          "description": "A few days ago, I created a new React project using Vite, and I intended to use Tailwind for styling. However, I ran into some issues ‚Äî Tailwind just couldn‚Äôt be initialised! I used the usual command npx tailwind init -p, but I got errors in my console.\nSo here‚Äôs what I did and how you can avoid similar issues when using Tailwind in your next Vite project.\n## Update NodeJS and NPM\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first step I took as my Node version was outdated. To check your Node version, use the command node -v. The latest version of Node can be obtained via the official website.\nFor NPM update, first check your version using npm -v, and to update it, use the command npm install -g npm. If you still encounter issues, let‚Äôs head onto the next step.\nUse the new Vite installation guide for Tailwind\n\n\n\nSince Tailwind v4, the process for installing Tailwind in a Vite project has slightly changed. The full guide can be found on the Tailwind website. It‚Äôs been simplified, and below are the steps.\n// Install tailwindcss via npm\nnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n\n// vite.config.ts \n// (Configure the Vite plugin)\n\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    tailwindcss(),\n  ],\n})\n\nYou‚Äôd notice in the second code block that the configuration is now done in the vite.config.ts and not the tailwind.config.js as in earlier versions. This step is crucial in determining whether your installation is successful or not.\nAfter taking these steps, my installation was successful, and I could use Tailwind to style my application as I wanted freely.\nIn the coming articles, I‚Äôll be writing articles about Tailwind and how to customise themes with the tailwind.config.js now gone in v4. If you appreciate this article, consider leaving a comment below. I‚Äôll swiftly reply to you.\nThanks for reading and have a good day. Ciao üëã",

Their REST APIs were slow, clunky, and driving users crazy. Mobile apps would make 5-10 API calls just to load a single screen, eating up data and battery life.\nSo they built something different: GraphQL.\nAt first, it was just an internal Facebook tool. But in 2015, they open-sourced it, and now everyone from GitHub to Shopify to Netflix uses it to power their APIs.\nThink of GraphQL as a smarter way to build APIs. It's not a database, it's not a framework‚Äîit's a query language that sits between your client and your data.\nREST APIs are like ordering from a set menu:\nWant user info?
