Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or updating your skills, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to get your SwiftUI app up and running.\nInstall the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store (Xcode 15 or newer).\nMake sure your macOS is updated to support the latest Xcode.\nFamiliarize yourself with the Swift 5.9+ language features introduced recently.\nOpen Xcode and choose \"Create a new Xcode project.\"\nSelect \"App\" under the iOS tab.\nName your project (e.g., SwiftShelfApp).\nEnsure \"Swift\" is selected as the language and \"SwiftUI\" as the interface.\nThe main entry point is marked with the @main attribute.\nYour ContentView.swift uses SwiftUI‚Äôs declarative syntax.\nLearn the basic building blocks like View, State, Binding, and ObservableObject.\nStart by modifying ContentView.swift:\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var counter = 0\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Welcome to SwiftShelf!\")\n                .font(.title)\n                .padding()\n            Text(\"You‚Äôve tapped \\(counter) times\")\n                .font(.headline)\n            Button(\"Tap Me\") {\n                counter += 1\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\nPress Cmd+R to build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.\nInteract with the button to see your app respond.\nExperiment with lists, navigation, and data flow.\nLearn about Combine framework for reactive programming.\nFollow Apple‚Äôs official SwiftUI tutorials and documentation.\nBy starting with these steps, you‚Äôll build a solid foundation for SwiftUI development in 2025 and beyond. Keep coding and exploring new features as Apple updates the ecosystem!\nHappy coding! üöÄ",
