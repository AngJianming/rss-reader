          "description": "I recently acquired Netatmo smart radiator valves to manage my rooms' temperature remotely. I'm not skilled at manual tasks, but I could easily replace the old thermo-static valves. I then registered the smart ones in the Netatmo app. Finally, I integrated them in my Home Assistant via the dedicated Netatmo integration. Everything was very straightforward.\nI noticed that each valve not only allows remote control but also offers a state with several attributes. I wanted to extract the room's temperature indicator from it. It was not as easy as I thought it was, so I want to describe how I managed to achieve it.\nBy default, the Netatmo valve displays a multi-valued state. To check, go to the Developer Tools > States menu. You can use a filter to find the device.\n\n\n\nEntity\nState\nAttributes\n\n\n…",

          "description": "Manufacturing has always been a complex balancing act—managing cost, quality, efficiency, and supply chains. Today, predictive analytics is helping manufacturers achieve that balance more effectively by unlocking insights hidden in their data.\nWhether it’s preventing machinery breakdowns or improving production schedules, predictive analytics is making manufacturing smarter and more efficient.\nIn short, it’s the use of data models to forecast events before they happen. It goes beyond traditional reporting and dashboards by leveraging AI/ML algorithms to suggest proactive actions.\nExamples include:\nPredicting machine failures before they occur\nForecasting customer demand\nIdentifying quality issues early in the line\nAnticipating supply chain disruptions\nPredictive Maintenance:\nAlgorithms detect patterns that typically precede defects—helping teams intervene before waste occurs.\nBy predicting demand accurately, manufacturers can keep optimal inventory levels and reduce carrying costs.\nSome manufacturers use analytics to monitor energy usage and forecast high-consumption periods, enabling cost-saving actions.\nData Collection: IoT sensors, machine logs, ERP data\nData Processing: ETL pipelines, cloud-based data lakes\nModeling: Python, R, TensorFlow, Azure ML\nDeployment: Real-time dashboards, API endpoints, embedded analytics\nYou don’t need to boil the ocean—start with a single problem area like downtime or product defects and iterate.\nWith tight margins and high customer expectations, manufacturers can't afford reactive strategies. Predictive analytics provides a strategic edge by reducing waste, improving efficiency, and driving innovation.\n👉 Read the full article here.",

But only some of us know that this global messaging platform used by billions of users is built by leveraging offshore software development teams. This shows that how this approach allows you to tap into global talent pool. It offers innovation, reduced costs, and accelerated time to market along with top-tier quality. In 2025, offshore services is s strategy used by many companies to stay competitive in this digital era. \nMany companies see offshore development as a cost-saving option but let me clear. Apart from cost, it also offers agility and innovation. Predictions states that it will reach to $389.7 billion by 2033, compared to $151.9 billion in 2025. These stats displays the confidence businesses are showing in offshore teams to offer high-quality and scalable software solutions. \nCost Efficiency\nFor example skilled developers from India only charge between $20-50 per hour, whereas Latin America and Eastern Europe provide same expertise with higher rates.\nBusinesses can use this cost advantage to operational expenses, recruitment, and infrastructure. This makes offshore development a budget friendly option for startups and as well as enterprises.  \nAccess to Global Talent\nScalability and Flexibility \nFaster Time-to-Market\nConclusion\noffshore over nearshore is not just about following trends but a strategic move aligned with your business requirements.

The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.\nUnfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.\n                 …",

Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nSource: John Karony\nKarony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.\nRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraud\n\nLatest in a line of crypto execs facing criminal charges\nAt the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.\nKarony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea.

          "description": "Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner on May 22. The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.\nSince Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. \nThe memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, includi…",

The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto.\nSB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin.\nTexas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione presenting SB 21.
