We've previously explored the introduction and individual implementation of both A2A and MCP. Now, we'll bring them together in a single, cohesive setup.\nModel Context Protocol (MCP) is a set of rules that defines how communication between an MCP client and an MCP server should be managed in order to utilize third-party services effectively.\nAgent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) is an open protocol that allows agents to interoperate across different ecosystems, frameworks, or organizations. It supports a dynamic, multi-agent environment where agents can communicate, discover each other, and collaborate autonomously.\nI have developed an A2A Registry for the AI community, do check it out and share in your netwo…",

It’s a lot sometimes, but I’m starting to enjoy the process.\nRecently started focusing more on DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms). It's challenging, but I’m trying to stay consistent and build up my problem-solving game.\nI’ve also been exploring full-stack dev — mostly looking at Django and how backend stuff works. Just taking it one step at a time.\nWhy I'm here?\nThat’s all for now.\nIf you’re also like me figuring things out, learning new stuff and all— let’s connect.\n📌 GitHub: https://github.com/AkshhThakkar\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshthakkar\nTill next post —\nAksh",

This approach empowers QA teams to leverage human insight alongside automation speed, enhancing both test coverage and efficiency.\nWhat is Hybrid Testing?\nHybrid Testing is a quality assurance methodology that blends manual and automated testing practices.
