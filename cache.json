          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nAs enterprise applications grow, their complexity increases. One key practice to keep code manageable is to separate business logic from controllers or data access code. That’s where the Service Layer Pattern comes in.\nDocumented in Martin Fowler’s Catalog of Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, this pattern proposes isolating all business rules into a dedicated layer, improving modularity, scalability, and testability.\nThe Service Layer acts as an intermediate layer between the application interface (e.g., API, UI) and the domain or persistence layers. It groups domain operations that follow business rules.\nAvoid duplicated logic across controllers.\nOrganize and centralize business rules.\nMake the system easier to maintain and test.\nLet’s build a basic system to…",

But more often than not? The real bug was upstream — in how the idea was communicated.\nAs engineers, we spend years mastering code but very little time mastering the craft of explaining our ideas. That gap can make the difference between launching with clarity or drowning in confusion.\nThe truth is: clear writing is clear thinking. And nowhere is this more visible than in a design doc.\nIf you want to drive real impact as a software engineer — especially at senior levels — writing great design docs isn’t just a nice-to-have.
