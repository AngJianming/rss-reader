          "description": "VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and it's essentially an invisibility cloak for your internet traffic. When you connect to the internet through a VPN, your data gets encrypted and routed through a secure server. \nVPN or Virtual Private Network is not something from The Matrix. It’s a tool that creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. Think of it like a secret underground tunnel for your data, away from the prying eyes of cybercriminals.\nWork from coffee shops without panic-sweating every time I opened a new tab\nHere’s what I now recommend after several trials, errors, and one very sketchy free VPN that tried to install a toolbar from 2007:\nNo-logs policy – You want a VPN that doesn’t track or store what you’re doing. Privacy means privacy.\nFast speeds …",

          "description": "It's just a tool\n\n\nGame engine is a tool, so it may be analyzed and rated. In order to do so, we need to understand, what game engine is.\nI present my own definition : game engine is an abstraction layer over separate autonomous systems : graphics, physics, sound, networking, user input, storage. Design of such abstraction layer may vary.\nThis is what game engine must be. Flexible, customizable for almost any needs. Now let's find a definition for modern and popular game engines, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot : an ecosystem, that provides means for user to create games, including a visual editor for game contents and assets.\nAnswering short, best architecture is no architecture.\nentity component system (ECS), MVC or OOP patterns.\nI personally would recommend dynamically typed languages with FFI (foreign function interface) to C or Java.\nPython, Groovy, Lua or similar.\ndynamically typed language.\nFollowing idea of this article, best game engine is no game engine.\nMy definition of game engine is very close to that. Game engine must be a thin abstraction layer over separate independent systems, so after you just write game logic.\nMostly, game programmers don't understand their desires. What game they want to do. So, they choose a game engine to make an AAA game, usually it's Unity or Unreal Engine. And, usually they end up making 2D platformers or 3D hyper-casual games with low-poly graphics.\nUnity, Unreal Engine and Godot give their users an illusion of comprehension and development, while they don't clearly understand how most of systems work.\nInstead of choosing game engine, choose programming language and libraries, and start writing games. You will thank me later.",
