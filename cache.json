          "description": "The landscape of software development tools has undergone radical transformation with the rise of \"vibe coding\" platforms that blend AI assistance, collaborative features, and intuitive interfaces. These tools empower developers to focus on creative problem-solving while automating repetitive tasks. From AI pair programmers to no-code app generators, the following tools represent the cutting edge of modern development workflows. But first, let's understand what is vibe coding. \n\nThe term \"vibe coding\" was coined by Andrej Karpathy, a prominent AI researcher and former Tesla AI lead, in February 2025. He described it as a style of coding where one \"fully gives in to the vibes, embraces exponentials, and forgets that the code even exists.\" Karpathy emphasized minimal keyboard interaction, re…",

Misalnya, ketika aplikasi musik tiba-tiba merekomendasikan lagu yang sangat cocok dengan selera kita, atau iklan yang muncul selalu terasa seperti dibuat khusus untuk kita. Hal ini terjadi karena AI makin pintar dan makin meresap ke dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Fenomena ini penting untuk dipahami oleh siapa saja yang menggunakan teknologi digital—mulai dari pelajar, pekerja, hingga pebisnis—karena AI kini sangat memengaruhi cara kita hidup dan bekerja.\nKenapa AI bisa makin pintar? \nbagaimana AI bisa tahu apa yang kita suka? \nDampaknya pada kehidupan kita sangat beragam. \nContohnya, AI mungkin salah memprediksi preferensi kita, sehingga kita kehilangan kesempatan mendapatkan informasi penting. Seringkali, kita tidak sadar bahwa keputusan sehari-hari sudah dipengaruhi oleh AI karena prosesnya berjalan secara otomatis dan tersembunyi.\nLalu, bagaimana kita menyikapi perkembangan ini supaya AI tidak merugikan? Pertama, kita perlu memahami bagaimana AI bekerja dan data apa saja yang kita bagikan. \nKedua, gunakan fitur privasi yang tersedia di aplikasi dan perangkat digital. \nKetiga, selalu kritis terhadap rekomendasi dan informasi yang diberikan oleh AI. Misalnya, jangan langsung percaya iklan yang muncul, tetapi cek dulu keasliannya agar tidak mudah tertipu. Dengan edukasi dan kesadaran yang baik, kita bisa lebih aman dan cerdas dalam memanfaatkan teknologi AI.\nBayangkan kamu sedang mencari pekerjaan, dan platform rekrutmen berbasis AI merekomendasikan pekerjaan yang tidak sesuai dengan minatmu hanya berdasarkan data lama yang pernah kamu input. \nApakah kamu akan mengikuti saran itu begitu saja? *\nIni contoh nyata bagaimana AI yang makin meresap bisa memengaruhi keputusan penting dalam hidup kita. Oleh karena itu, yuk mulai kenali AI yang kamu gunakan, atur privasi dengan baik, dan jangan takut bertanya serta belajar supaya AI benar-benar menjadi alat yang membantu, bukan justru mengatur hidup kita tanpa kita sadari.",

          "description": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.\n“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”\n“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.\nCoinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.
