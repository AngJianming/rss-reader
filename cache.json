Proper observability tracks application and infrastructure activity, provides core insights into performance and system health, and allows IT teams to quickly identify and solve problems before they impact end users.\nThe best way to implement observability is by setting up observability tools within your infrastructure. Once correctly implemented, these tools can detect performance issues, security threats, and health threats, providing full visibility into the system.\nDatadog and Splunk are the leading observability tools with unique features.
