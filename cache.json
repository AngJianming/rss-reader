          "description": "Introdução\n\n\nArquitetura Orientada a Eventos ou Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) e Event Sourcing são termos que frequentemente são confundidos, mas têm propósitos distintos. EDA é um padrão de comunicação para desacoplar serviços por meio de eventos. Event Sourcing é uma estratégia de persistência de dados que captura mudanças de estado como eventos imutáveis. Este artigo esclarece suas diferenças e demonstra como eles se complementam.  \nEDA é um paradigma de arquitetura de software centrado na produção e detecção de eventos, permitindo escalabilidade, tolerância a falhas e baixo acoplamento. Eventos representam mudanças significativas de estado (ex: PedidoPago) e se propagam por canais de eventos (como RabbitMQ ou Kafka).  \nEm um sistema monolítico de compras, um serviço de checkout pode …",

          "description": "The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.\nThe Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.\nRegulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. \nOf particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill. \nStablecoins globally have grown …",

The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.\nThink of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy.
