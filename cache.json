          "description": "1. Scalability\nসমাধান: Redis Pub/Sub এবং socket.io adapter ব্যবহার করে load balancing করা যায়, যাতে multiple server instance একে অপরের সঙ্গে message sync করতে পারে।\n2. Sticky Sessions Requirement\nসমস্যা: যদি sticky session ঠিকমতো কনফিগার না করা হয়, তাহলে connection drop বা message loss হতে পারে।\nসমাধান: Load balancer (যেমন Nginx বা HAProxy)-এ sticky session কনফিগার করতে হয় অথবা session-affinity enabled proxy ব্যবহার করা উচিত।\n3. Connection Drop ও Reconnection Handling\nসমাধান: ক্লায়েন্টে reconnect লজিক থাকা উচিত। Socket.io এই ফিচার built-in ভাবে দেয়।\n4. Resource Usage ও Server Limitation\nসমাধান:\nConnection limit সেট করা\nIdle connection timeout কনফিগার করা\nসার্ভার instance স্কেল করা\n5. Load Balancer Configuration\nসমস্যা: যদি Load balancer upgrade এবং connection হেডারগুলো সঠিকভাবে forward না করে, তাহলে WebSocket কাজ করবে না।\nসমাধান: Load balancer-এ WebSocket এর জন্য Upgrade হেডার, HTTP/1.1, এবং sticky session properly enable করতে হয়।\n6. Firewall / Proxy Issues\nসমাধান:\nSSL ব্যবহার করে (wss://) secure connection চালানো\nProxy configuration অনুযায়ী WebSocket Upgrade হেডার সেট করা\nPort allow করা (যেমন 3000, 8080, ইত্যাদি)\nSecurity Concerns\nWebSocket CORS, CSRF protection-এর মতো traditional web security layer automatically follow করে না। এই কারণে unauthorized access, XSS বা DDoS এর শিকার হতে পারে।\nসমাধান:\nAuthentication middleware যোগ করা (যেমন JWT)\nSSL/TLS encryption ব্যবহার করা\nRate limiting setup করা\n8. Resource Cleanup\nসমস্যা: Proper disconnect event handle না করলে unused socket connection থেকে RAM leak হয়।\nসমাধান:\n9. Protocol Standardization\nসমাধান: JSON-based structured messaging বা custom protocol define করা।\n10. Debugging এবং Monitoring কঠিন\nসমাধান:\nCustom logging middleware যুক্ত করা\nReal-time monitoring tools যেমন Sentry, LogRocket ব্যবহার করা।\nউপসংহার:\nWebSocket চমৎকার একটি প্রযুক্তি যা রিয়েল-টাইম অ্যাপ্লিকেশন তৈরির জন্য খুবই উপযোগী। তবে এগুলোর ব্যবহারে উপরের চ্যালেঞ্জগুলো মাথায় রেখে সঠিকভাবে configuration ও architecture design করলে পারফরম্যান্স ও reliability দুটোই নিশ্চিত করা সম্ভব।",

But I quickly realized that Next.js isn’t ideal for Chrome extensions—its architecture and bundling system aren’t optimized for that use case.  \nAfter some research, I discovered that Vite + React was a better fit, and I found a great boilerplate that used PNPM as its package manager. That got me thinking: Why PNPM? Why not Yarn or NPM, which I’ve used before?  \nSo, I dug deeper into the differences between these package managers.
