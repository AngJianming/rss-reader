          "description": "When working with APIs, we often encounter data in formats that do not match our application's preferred coding style. For instance, if you're using TypeScript and Vue.js, you might receive data in snake_case from an API but prefer to work with camelCase throughout your application. The good news is that you can easily transform this data without losing type safety. Let's delve into how you can achieve that with the help of interfaces and utility types in TypeScript.\nUnderstanding the Problem\nWhen you define an interface such as MergedReviewDetails, you structure your data according to your application's needs. An example of this could be:\nexport interface MergedReviewDetails {\n  parentReview: Mmcid;\n  childReviews: Mmcid[];\n}\n\nHowever, the API might return data with properties in snake_ca‚Ä¶",

The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether.

Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to Donald Trump‚Äôs corruption, ‚Äúownership of crypto,‚Äù and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a ‚Äúroundtable‚Äù rather than a hearing.\nHFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers at the hearing to create a ‚Äúlasting framework‚Äù on digital assets, but did not directly address any of Rep. Waters‚Äô and Democrats‚Äô concerns about Trump‚Äôs involvement with the crypto industry. He claimed Waters was making the hearing a partisan issue and shutting down discussion on a digital asset regulatory framework.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",
