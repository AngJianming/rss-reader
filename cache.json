          "description": "A few years ago, detecting and responding to cyber threats meant signature-based systems, rule-heavy SIEMs, and a team of analysts swimming in alerts. Fast forward to today—and suddenly, it feels like cybersecurity is quietly undergoing a transformation right under our noses.\nWhat changed?\nWe now have systems that can learn normal behavior, adapt to new threats in real time, and even simulate attack paths before they’re exploited. Not perfectly. Not universally. But undeniably. Whether you're deep in blue team operations or building dev tools, chances are you’ve already interacted with some layer of this new approach—whether you realized it or not.\nThis isn’t just about automation. It’s about augmentation.\nModern cyber defense strategies aren’t just faster—they’re smarter. But here’s the question that’s been stuck in my head lately:\nAre we trusting the machines too much, or not enough?\nBecause while AI-based tools are making a real impact—from anomaly detection to adaptive access control—they’re also introducing new risks. Model poisoning. False positives at scale. A widening skills gap. And worst of all, a sense of overconfidence that the system will “catch it.”\nSo where’s the balance?\nThere's a free masterclass happening on 28th May that's diving into this exact space. It’s framed for IT leaders, but it looks like anyone interested in practical insights and forward-thinking strategies would benefit. I’ve already signed up, so if you’re exploring this frontier too, maybe we’ll cross paths there.\n👉(https://www.netcomlearning.com/webinar/Cybersecurity-Masterclass-How-AI-is-Redefining-Cyber-Defense?utm_source=devto.com)",

Once I made that decision, I needed to start somewhere - and for me, that was authentication.\nThis post covers how I approached it using FastAPI, why I avoided localStorage, and how I made authentication declarative with a custom router.\nThere are many ways to handle authentication, but I chose the most popular and relatively reliable approach: JWT auth. The spec generally assumes two endpoints:\nOne to get an access + refresh token\n\nOne to get a new access token if the previous one has expired\nThe client needs to store these tokens somewhere and send them with each request—usually in headers. They're often stored in localStorage, which isn’t very secure.\nBut I wasn’t as concerned with security (this isn’…",

So how does an AI system like Google Assistant or Siri know what the speaker meant? That’s where the beauty of speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) kicks in.\n\nLet’s understand it down step by step:\n\nWhen you speak, your voice creates vibrations in the air. A microphone picks up those sound waves and converts them into digital data, essentially, a stream of numbers that represent how your voice changes over time.\nBut AI doesn’t listen to this data the way humans do.\n\nInstead, it transforms it into a spectrogram, a visual map of sound over time.

Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post, adding:\n“Something that has to be said though - this hack - which includes home …",

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”\n“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.\nCoinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.\n\nMagazine: Father-son team lists Africa’s XRP Healthcare on Canadian stock exchange",
