That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.\nGPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.\nWhile GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable.
