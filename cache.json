          "description": "Surviving Extreme Programming: A Developer's Wild Ride\n\n\nHave you ever wanted to strap your coding practices to a rocket and send them to the moon? That is what Extreme Programming (XP) does to traditional software development. As a developer who has been through the XP wringer, I am here to tell you it is both terrifying and exhilarating - like riding a rollercoaster built by the same people who review your pull requests.\nExtreme Programming is like regular programming, but after it's chugged five espressos. It takes good engineering practices and cranks them up to eleven.\nThink of it this way: If traditional development is like carefully planning a road trip with maps and hotel reservations, XP is more like deciding to drive cross-country with only a compass, a full tank of gas, and the ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Debugging failing tests can be time-consuming and frustrating‚Äîespecially when error messages are long or snapshot diffs are difficult to interpret. With the latest AI-powered tools in Playwright, resolving test failures has become significantly faster and more intuitive.\nConsider a basic Playwright test that uses snapshot testing to verify that the content inside getByRole('main') matches a previously stored snapshot. The snapshot might contain two distinct headings, for example.\nIf the heading level in the application is changed‚Äîfrom <h1> to <h2>‚Äîthe test fails, as expected, due to a mismatch with the stored snapshot.
