          "description": "We’ve been following the Model Content Protocol (MCP) for the past couple of weeks. But in the meantime, Google introduced something new Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol which further expands the capabilities of AI agents. Interestingly, it complements the Model Content Protocol we discussed in recent blogs.\nIn this post, we deep dive into the A2A Protocol, exploring its functionalities and how it complements MCP.\n\nEvery innovation arises from a need. Similarly, the development of A2A protocol was motivated by a need for efficient, autonomous agent collaboration.\nLet’s understand this through a real-world example:\nSuppose you want to order lunch but are unsure what to pick. You decide to go with the cheapest option among pasta, pizza, or a full meal. You start by interacting with Domino’s age…",

          "description": "Newborn jaundice is a common condition that affects many infants shortly after birth. Characterized by a yellowing of the skin and eyes, this condition is caused by elevated levels of bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. While jaundice is usually harmless and resolves on its own, in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to serious complications if left untreated. For new parents, understanding the causes, treatment options, and monitoring methods for newborn jaundice is essential.

Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.\nAs a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze.
