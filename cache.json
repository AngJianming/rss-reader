          "description": "Understanding data structures is essential for every programmer. Whether you're writing simple scripts or building complex systems, knowing the right way to store, manage, and access data can dramatically improve your code’s performance and readability. Mastering data structures also plays a big role in coding interviews, making them a key area for anyone pursuing a career in software development.\nArrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They store elements in a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory and allow direct access to elements using indexes. Their simplicity and efficiency make them ideal for tasks like storing sequences or performing quick lookups when the index is known. However, since their size is fixed, inserting or deleting elements can be less efficient.\nLink…",

Then maybe 3-5 more depending on what kind of weird edge cases your business throws at you.\nBut seriously, don't be that guy who tries to tag literally everything.
