          "description": "We are living in times when vision-language models (VLMs) are rapidly evolving with each of them having their own pros and cons and uniqueness to stand out. MiMo-VL-7B, recently launched by Xiaomi, is now trending on Hugging Face and stands out as a compact yet remarkably capable model that pushes the boundaries of multi-modal reasoning. At just 7B parameters, MiMo-VL-7B integrates a native-resolution ViT encoder that captures fine-grained visual detail, an efficient MLP projector for cross-modal alignment, and the MiMo-7B language model optimized specifically for complex reasoning. Its development spans a rigorous two-phase training pipeline: a four-stage pretraining phase that results in the SFT variant, and a post-training phase introducing Mixed On-policy Reinforcement Learning (MORL),…",

I wanted to build a secure app that allows users to safely store passwords and sensitive information completely offline with strong AES-256 encryption. CyberSafe requires no account, no cloud sync, and fully respects user privacy.\nThe app features a clean and intuitive interface optimized for both phones and tablets. Some key features include:\nManage passwords, notes, and 2FA (TOTP) codes\nPowerful password generator and smart security check\nSecure backup and restore stored locally on your device\nNo ads, no tracking, no data collection\nI would be grateful for your support, feedback, and congratulations as I continue to improve and grow CyberSafe.\nThank you all for following along and being part of this journey!\nCyberSafe - Google Play",

Sounds great, right? But here’s the catch:\nThe UI library is versioned.\nDifferent MFEs might depend on different versions of the library.\nUpgrading all MFEs to the latest version simultaneously is a logistical nightmare.\nWhy is this a problem? Well, web components use the global namespace for their custom elements. This means you can’t define two versions of the same element (e.g., v1 and v2 of the same component) with the same name in the same document.\nThankfully, some brilliant minds have already thought about this problem. Enter the concept of Scoped Custom Element Registries.\nBack in 2020, …",

There is a guide using Genkit, Firebase AI Logic and Gemini API in your apps.\nIf you don’t know already, Genkit is a Firebase open source library to create full stack apps based on AI, so it’s created by Google. You can easily connect to Gemini, Imagen, OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, Mistral and Ollama and other with this library.\nA vibe coding t-shirt\nIn the guide you’ll find examples of simple apps built with AI that showcase how it can be used for practical B2B and B2C applications.\nThe second guide “Using AI for development” is doing what I mentioned in previous post.
