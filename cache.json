However, at times you could be mistaken that you need to prefix the promise everytime you want to form a chain.\nLet's understand it with the following examples:\nFirst, here is a simple promise created with the Promise() constructor function. The promise resolves immidiately with a result value of 10.\nconst ten = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    resolve(10);\n});\n\nNow, to form a Promise Chain, let us chain a bunch of .then() handler functions:\n// Promise Chain\n\nten.then((result) => {\n    // returns 20\n    return result + 10;\n})\n.then((result) => {\n    // returns 200\n    return result * 10;\n})\n.then((result) => {\n    // returns…",
