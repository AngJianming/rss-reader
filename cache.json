          "description": "TL;DR: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok as “left-leaning” propaganda after it spouted white-genocide conspiracy claims and Holocaust skepticism due to buggy programming. She even shared a screenshot of Grok calling her a Christian who “contradicts Christian values” by backing QAnon and divisive rhetoric.\nDespite the kerfuffle and X’s recent outages (blamed partly on an Oregon data-center fire), Greene wrapped up with a zinger: over-relying on AI for truth will leave you “lost,” reminding us that human discernment still beats a bot’s glitchy hot takes.",

This approach is especially valuable when using AI coding assistants, where real-time code suggestions can include flawed or risky logic. Addressing issues early minimizes the potential for expensive rework or post-deployment fixes.\nAI tools like Windsurf and Cursor are trained on vast datasets, some of which may include insecure patterns or deprecated functions.

These tools significantly boost productivity, but questions around the security and quality of AI-generated code remain. Benchmarking the outputs of these tools against recognized secure coding standards—namely OWASP and SANS—can offer critical insights into their safety and reliability.\nCursor and Windsurf have emerged as two of the most advanced AI-assisted coding tools in recent times. Cursor, based on VS Code, uses large language models (LLMs) to assist with contextual code generation, debugging, and refactoring through natural language prompts.

These CMSes are fast to set up, supported by large plugin ecosystems, and ideal for a variety of use cases.\nI’ll be focusing specifically on traditional CMS platforms that come with a built-in frontend and handle both content management and page rendering in one place.

But then comes the dreaded handoff to the developers. It's like speaking two different languages, right? That's where AI comes in. AI integration in Figma can seriously cut down the time it takes to translate your designs into actual, working code.\nThink about it. Instead of manually writing out every single line of code based on your design, AI tools can analyze your Figma files and automatically generate the code for you. This not only speeds things up but also reduces the chance of errors creeping in during the translation process. Plus, it frees up developers to focus on the more complex, creativ…",

You might run into clunky plugins, awkward iframes, or glitches that break the user experience. PDF.js gives you a powerful, open-source JavaScript library to display and interact with PDF files right in the browser.\nNow, figuring out how to use PDF.js in your React project can be daunting at first. To leverage PDF.js's capabilities, it's important to understand how its layered structure works. \nIf you’ve ever wondered, “How do I highlight text selection?” or “How do I interact with links inside the PDF?” or even “How do I build advanced features like annotations?”, the answer usually lies in understanding these layers.\nIn this guide, you'll see how PDF.js splits content into layers, what those layers …",
