          "description": "If you don't know me yet, I have been working on ArkScript for nearly 6 years now. ArkScript is a scripting language in modern C++, running on a custom virtual machine (like Python or Lua), with the goal of having a syntax easy to learn and use, a C++ interface to embed it in programs, and decent performances (without trying to be as fast as Lua though, Mike Pall is a genius and did outstanding work on LuaJIT).\nA silly question that you shouldn't care about, unless the perceived slowness of the language is becoming a problem.\nRecently, I added more benchmarks to the language, and I was quite astonished to see that it was 1.5 times slower than Python on such a simple benchmark:\n(mut collection [])\n(mut i 0)\n(while (< i 1000000) {\n  (append! collection i)\n  (set i (+ i 1)) })\n\n(mut sum 0)\n(s…",

How is data allocated and destroyed?\nOur system has objects transparently migrating from server to server, so pointers are not an option - we have references instead. References can become invalid if the referenced object is destroyed, which leaves us with two options. Guarantee at the compiler and runtime level that all references remain valid while used, through lifetime tracking and the borrow checker, or force the programmer to handle the case of an invalid reference on every access.\nThe latter is easier, if we introduce \"owning references\", which there can be only one of, and that are always valid.

          "description": "Elm has always taken a distinctive path—one that shuns the “more is better” mentality in favor of a lean, well-curated set of language constructs. In many mainstream languages like JavaScript, Python, and even Haskell, developers often find a hefty toolbox of features that promise flexibility and convenience. Elm, however, intentionally leaves many of these tools at the door. And while that might seem limiting at first glance, it is precisely this excision of “extra” features that makes Elm so robust, predictable, and enjoyable to work with.\nIn this post, we’ll first explore additional examples of features that popular languages offer but that Elm leaves out. Then, we’ll dive into several uniquely powerful Elm features—elements so carefully designed that you won’t find their counterparts i…",
