          "description": "Docker has revolutionized the way developers build, ship, and run applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering these essential Docker commands and tips will make you more efficient and productive.  \nBefore using Docker, ensure you have it installed by running:\ndocker --version\n\nTo get detailed system info, use:\ndocker info\n\nQuickly run a container with:\ndocker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-container nginx\n\nThis runs an Nginx server in detached mode (-d), mapping port 8080 on your machine to port 80 inside the container.  \nTo see all running containers:\ndocker ps\n\nTo include stopped containers:\ndocker ps -a\n\nStop a running container:\ndocker stop my-container\n\nRemove a stopped container:\ndocker rm my-container\n\nRemove all stopped containers at once:\ndocker rm $(docker ps -aq)\n\nOver time, unused images take up space. Remove them with:\ndocker image prune -a\n\nIf you have a Dockerfile, build an image with:\ndocker build -t my-app .\n\nThis tags the image as my-app.  \nUse interactive mode to execute commands inside a running container:\ndocker exec -it my-container /bin/sh\n\nFor Ubuntu-based containers, use /bin/bash.  \nMonitor logs with:\ndocker logs -f my-container\n\nThe -f flag shows real-time updates.  \nCopy files from your local machine to a running container:\ndocker cp myfile.txt my-container:/app/\n\nCopy files from a container to your machine:\ndocker cp my-container:/app/myfile.txt .\n\nInstead of running multiple containers manually, define them in docker-compose.yml and start them with:\ndocker-compose up -d\n\nStop and remove all services:\ndocker-compose down\n\nüíº LinkedIn  |  üìÇ GitHub  |  ‚úçÔ∏è Dev.to  |  üåê Hashnode\nFound this useful?
