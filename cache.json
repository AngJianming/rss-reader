The whiteboard questions, the algorithm drills, the awkward silences when you blank out mid-sentence... it’s brutal. And when you're applying for dev jobs in a competitive market, even one bad round can cost you that dream offer.  \nThat’s why I decided to try something different. Instead of cramming alone or burning out on LeetCode marathons, I let an AI interview coach take over. Yep, I used a platform called OfferGoose — and spoiler alert: it changed everything.  \n\nThe first thing that surprised me? OfferGoose isn’t just a glorified question bank.

          "description": "Type Inference\n\n\nTypeScript can often guess types automatically. This is called type inference. When you assign a value without an explicit type, TypeScript infers it. For example:\nlet count = 10;         // inferred as number\nlet message = \"Hello\";  // inferred as string\n\nThe compiler knows count is a number and message is a string from these initial values. Type inference helps keep code concise and still type-safe. You don't always need to write : number or : string because TypeScript figures it out.\nLess code: You skip repetitive type annotations.\n\n\nSafety: Even with fewer annotations, TypeScript checks types.\n\n\nReadability: Code stays clean while avoiding obvious errors.\n\n\n\nHowever, you can still add type annotations if it makes the code clearer or if a variable’s type isn’t obvious. …",

          "description": "Key takeaways: \n\nTraders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. \n\nOn-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. \n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. \nA bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. \nBTC/USDT 1-day chart.
