While this might not be an issue for small datasets, it can lead to serious performance degradation at scale.\nJPA's N+1 problem is closely related to how entity relationships are fetched using JPQL, which is an object-oriented abstraction over SQL. JPQL queries typically only target the root entity and ignore related entities unless explicitly fetched.\nEven Spring Data JPA's query methods and QueryDSL ultimately execute JPQL under the hood, so understanding this behavior is essential.\nWhen a related entity is needed during entity access (based on the FetchType), Hibernate performs additional queries to retrieve them.
