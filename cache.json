          "description": "Understanding Ownership with Structs and Functions in Rust\n\n\nRust's ownership model is one of its most powerful—and sometimes intimidating—features. If you're diving into Rust, you've likely encountered its strict rules around ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. While these rules might feel restrictive at first, they empower Rust to provide memory safety without a garbage collector. In this post, we'll tackle a key question: How does ownership work when passing structs to and from functions?\nWe'll explore the nuances of ownership as it applies to structs, comparing move, borrow, and mutable borrow in function arguments. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use these concepts effectively and avoid common pitfalls.\nBefore we dive into structs and functions, let’s quickly …",
