          "description": "🧨 Introduction: The Hero You Never Noticed\n\n\nIt hides in plain sight.\n\nIt means nothing… and yet, without it, everything breaks.  \nWe’re talking about zero (0) — the ninja of numbers, the invisible warrior of math, and quite possibly the most dangerous number in your codebase.\nSounds dramatic?\n\nGood. Because zero is dramatic. Let’s unravel why.\nThousands of years ago, civilizations thrived without the number zero.\nThe Romans had no symbol for zero.\nTry writing 2025 in Roman numerals: MMXXV — not a zero in sight.\nAncient Egyptians also skipped it. Imagine doing math without nothing.\nIt wasn’t until around 7th century India that Brahmagupta gave us a formal concept of zero — as both a number and a placeholder. That changed everything:\nFrom calculating stars to building Google’s search algorithm — zero laid the foundation.\n\n\n\nFeature\nWhy It's Crazy\n\n\n\n\n\n0 means nothing\nBut it’s still something\n\n\n\n\n0 adds no value\nBut it’s crucial in 10, 100, 1000\n\n\n\n0 / x = 0\nBut x / 0 = Infinity or crash!\n\n\n0 / 0 = NaN\nWait... what? 😵\n\n\n\n0 is falsy in code\nBut sometimes it’s a valid value\n\n\n\nLet’s test your instincts:\nconsole.log(2 / 2);   // 1 ✅\nconsole.log(0 / 2);   // 0 ✅\nconsole.log(2 / 0);   // Infinity 😵\nconsole.log(0 / 0);   // NaN 😱\n\nWait… 0 / 0 = NaN?\nThat’s right. Because there’s no single correct answer.\nAnd your program doesn’t like ambiguity.\nLet’s list some real-world zero problems:\nDivide-by-zero exceptions → 💥 App crash\nFalsy values in conditionals → Missed logic paths\nOff-by-one errors → Classic loop bugs\nUnintended array behavior → array[0] is fine, but array[-1]? 🪦\nZero is sneaky. One minute it's a valid value, the next it's triggering bugs you’ll chase for hours.\nEvery image, website, or TikTok dance you see on your phone is just a giant sea of 0s and 1s.\nZero isn’t just \"nothing.\"\nZero may look harmless.\nNext time your code misbehaves, don’t overlook the quietest suspect.\nThe real bug might be... 0.",

Some were just starting out, others were industry veterans, and everyone had something unique to share.
