          "description": "May 31st ‚Äì Kicking Off with Momentum üöÄ\nToday was all about momentum. It‚Äôs only Day 2 of the hackathon, and Story Hero is already taking shape faster than we thought possible ‚Äî thanks to the magic of Bolt.new.\nDaniel fired up Bolt with a prompt as simple as:\n‚ÄúBuild a hello world mobile app using Expo‚Äù\n...and what came back was way more than expected. Within seconds, we had a full app scaffold ‚Äî multiple screens, clean navigation, smooth animations, and even styling we didn‚Äôt ask for (but definitely appreciated).\nIt wasn‚Äôt just fast ‚Äî it felt like opening up a premium boilerplate made just for us. A great sign for how much we‚Äôll be able to accomplish in 30 days.\n\n\n\nWe wrapped final designs, aligned on the onboarding experience, and scoped where to implement paywalls (via RevenueCat for the Make More Money Challenge). A lot of the discussion focused on making onboarding feel magical and intentional ‚Äî collecting just enough data to make stories feel deeply personal for each kid.\nOne unexpected challenge: even with Supabase‚Äôs 6-minute edge function runtime, we consistently blew past CPU limits during story generation. So ‚Äî we‚Äôre offloading the heavy lifting to Firebase functions. Not ideal, but it keeps our momentum strong while maintaining scalability.\nWe‚Äôre building fast, learning faster, and staying focused on one thing: helping kids fall in love with stories again üìöüí´\nStay tuned ‚Äî tomorrow‚Äôs all about onboarding polish and core testing.\n‚Äì Josh & Daniel\n\nTeam Story Hero\nstoryhero.com (coming soon)\nWhat is Story Hero?\nTwitter/X\nDEV Blog",

We had a ton of concepts, but ultimately, one idea stood out:\nStory Hero ‚Äî an AI-powered storytelling app that helps parents generate personalized, calming, and educational stories for their kids.\nWith our vision locked in, Daniel got to work setting up everything we need: accounts for Bolt.new, GitHub, Figma, DEV, and more. No code written yet, but now we‚Äôve got the rails laid to move fast.\nMeanwhile, Josh dove into technical exploration. To test our vision, he spun up a quick Node script and evaluated multiple image generation APIs ‚Äî Stable Diffusion, Gemini, Leonardo, DALL¬∑E 3, and more.\nThe key problem: art style consistency across story pages ‚Äî something most tools struggle with.\nEventually, we found a promising lead: Image Gen 1, which allows for coherent visuals using a single reference image. The trick? Frame the image generation as a conversation with the AI, using the title to maintain consistent context and style ‚Äî even while processing multiple pages in parallel.\nWe also added concurrency and batching to keep generation fast without sacrificing consistency.\nOn the UX side, we researched bedtime-focused UI/UX design. Since our app is meant for wind-down moments with kids, we decided on a calming dark theme inspired by dreamy, sleepy-time palettes from Dribbble. With help from ChatGPT, we rapidly iterated on ideas and built out initial views in Figma.\nWe're just getting started ‚Äî but the vision is clear. This isn't just a hackathon app. We're here to build something real. Story Hero is about reclaiming screen time for creativity, imagination, and connection.\nMore tomorrow.\n‚ú® Let‚Äôs make bedtime magical again.\n‚Äî Josh & Daniel\nstoryhero.com (coming soon)\nWhat is Story Hero?\nTwitter/X\nDEV Blog",
