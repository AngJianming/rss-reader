I just wanted to build cool things and solve real world problems.\nToday, I lead a small team, manage our infrastructure, make technical decisions, and still write a lot of code every day.\nMy younger self would have never imagined this path.\nMy first programming job came during my second year of college. I joined as a junior programmer building a school management system using ASP.NET Web Forms. The codebase followed a clean structure with multi-layer architecture, MVC, and solid naming conventions. It was my first exposure to how real software was built, and I loved it.\nBut I was curious about more. Web Forms felt outdated, and I kept wondering how modern web apps were built. That curiosity led me to discover AngularJS and React. It completely changed how I saw…",

Because if we do traditional strategy it will lose performances and slow down it but if we do like 20s that will use like 128mb of VRAM place of GB, then we combine the grade with color set grade.\nA color set it's who take care of color and with two category the cool one blue and purple, and the warm one red and yellow.

Specifically, is the height of the scroll thumb automatically set based on the scrollable area? If not, how can you customize its height through CSS? In this article, we'll tackle these questions and provide a clear solution.\nUnderstanding the Scroll Thumb Behavior\nThe scrollbar thumb is a UI element that allows users to scroll through a container with content that overflows its bounds. By default, the height of the scrollbar thumb is not a fixed size and varies based on the amount of scrollable content. CSS gives you the ability to control various aspects of the scrollbar, but there are some limitations to be aware of.\nWhat You Should Know About Scrol…",

Coming from a Node.js background, where I’d spent years working with tools like BullMQ and RabbitMQ, Go’s concurrency model felt like a puzzle. My first attempt—a minimal queue with round-robin channel selection—was, well, buggy. Let’s just say it worked until it didn’t.\nBut that’s how learning goes, right?\nIn my professional work, I’ve used tools like BullMQ and RabbitMQ for event-driven solutions, and p-queue and p-limit for handling concurrency. Naturally, I began wondering if there were similar tools in Go. I found packages like asynq, ants, and various worker pools—solid, battle-tested options.

JavaScript was released in December 1995, which moved the web from a read-only medium to an interactive experience.
