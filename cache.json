Building with Freestyle Jobs\nBuild my Java app using Maven\nRun shell scripts (after configuring Jenkins to recognize Git Bash)\nUnderstand that the pom.xml file is essential for Maven builds because it defines the project structure and dependencies\nFreestyle jobs provide an easy way to experiment, but there are limitations when the build process becomes more complex.\n2. Exploring Pipelines ‚Äì Defining Builds as Code\nPipeline jobs allow defining every build step as code within a Jenkinsfile. Instead of using the UI, the process is scripted, for example:\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  stages {\n    stage('Build') {\n      steps {\n        echo 'Running build...'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nThis approach enables version control of build processes, clearer visibility into each stage, and better scalability for complex workflows.",

          "description": "A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.\nAccording to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering, and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nKarony, former chief technology officer, Thomas Smith, and the platform‚Äôs creator, Kyle Nagy, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly ‚Äúdiverted and misappropriated millions of dollars‚Äô worth‚Äù of SafeMoon‚Äôs SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, could handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",
