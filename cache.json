          "description": "In this tutorial, we‚Äôll walk through how to create a custom map using a large image in Leaflet, a lightweight JavaScript library for building interactive maps in web applications.\nThis technique is useful when working with non-geographical maps or images that you want to make interactive, zoomable, and possibly annotated.\nHere are some use cases where custom maps from image are applicable:\nIndoor Maps: This is a common use case‚Äîthink of malls, airports, or exhibition halls where a visual indoor layout helps visitors navigate.\nVideo Game Maps: Many games come with expansive in-game worlds. Custom maps allow for interactive player guides. For example, The Forest Map provides an interactive map for players of The Forest game.\nZoomable Images: You‚Äôre not limited to maps.
