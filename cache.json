          "description": "I recently came across Tyler McKnight’s post on what exchanges actually do after a token is listed. As someone who has worked in marketing — and more specifically in the blockchain/crypto space — I felt it raised some important truths, but also left room for deeper discussion.\nSo here's my take.\nIn the Web3 world, getting listed on a CEX is treated like the finish line. But anyone who’s spent time in this space knows it’s just the beginning — and in many ways, the most brutal phase for a project.\nYes, listings create visibility. But the real challenge? Maintaining relevance once the launch buzz fades. As Tyler notes, exchanges aren’t here to babysit your metrics or fix your community gaps. They provide the rails — it’s up to projects to actually drive.\nFrom my experience, here’s where most…",

Usually, as there is an underlying assumption of knowledge from the wider team, or also people don't know much about the tool, but utilise abstraction to implement it as best as they know how.
