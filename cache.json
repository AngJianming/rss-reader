Unfortunately, that means you can't follow along this journey with point-in-time code. But if you are interested in skipping to the end, the repo is there and it should be functional.\nSo for those that haven't really used any of the genai chatbots, where do you start with generating code? That part is actually pretty easy; you choose a provider/LLM and give it a simple prompt, and iterate on the prompt. Usually the chatbot will acknowledge the request, and ask clarifying questions or make suggestions. For example, this is what I used:\nI want to build a very basic app for entering financial transactions.\nI can describe the mode…",

Lately, that panic has been aimed squarely at AI.\n“ChatGPT is making people rude!”\nYou’ve probably heard one of those takes, or maybe dropped a few of your own. But here’s the thing: this isn’t new...\nThe wheel made us lazy.\nBooks turned us into loners.\nRadio destroyed focus.\nTV made us become zombies.\nThe internet killed print media.\nSmartphones broke society.\nEach innovation was met with moral panic, but over time, we didn’t lose our humanity—we redefined it.\nAI isn’t magic. It’s a tool. And like any powerful tool, it reflects our values, biases, and intentions. Used carelessly, it can certainly cause disruption. Used thoughtfully, it becomes a multiplier for creativity, understanding, and problem-solving.\nThe real threat isn’t AI, it’s how we choose to interact with it. Just like driving didn’t erase walking, AI won’t erase thinking. It just frees us from some of the busywork that distracts us from doing it better.\nInstead of asking:\n\"Will AI ruin society?\"\nMaybe we should ask:\n\"What kind of society do we want AI to amplify?\"\nBecause that's the heart of it.\nAI doesn’t make people rude. Bad attitudes do.\nSo, will AI reshape the world? Yes. Just like the wheel, the printing press, the microchip, and the web. But ruin it?

Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.\nThe reported acquisition came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but did not receive a response from either at the time of publication.\n\nRelated: Ripple acquisition of Hidden Road a ‘defining moment’ for XRPL — Ripple CTO\nRipple reportedly had an $11 billion valuation in 2024, an estimate CEO Brad Garlinghouse called “outdated” as of January. The blockchain company purchased prime broker Hidden Road for roughly $1.2 billion in April, claiming the move would help scale activity for XRP and XRP Ledger.\nCourt cases winding down\nIt’s unclear whether Ripple intends to pursue the Circle acquisition as the firm begins to clear some of its legal entanglements with US regulators. \nIn August 2024, a court found Ripple liable for $125 million in a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first filed in 2020. However, Garlinghouse announced in March that the SEC planned to drop its appeal against the firm over the ruling, with Ripple later stating it would pay a net $50 million for the lower court judgment.\n\nBoth announcements followed meetings between Garlinghouse, Ripple chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty, and US President Donald Trump. The blockchain firm contributed $5 million to Trump’s inauguration fund after his election victory, and both executives attended events as official guests on Jan. 20.\nMagazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",

According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.\n“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto.
