          "description": "As usual, I received JSON data from the backend developer, but it was in a .txt file. I had to download it, copy the content, and paste it into an online formatter to view it properly.\nHonestly, I was getting tired of this process, so I started looking for a more convenient solution. That’s when I stumbled upon a website that made things so much easier. If I want to share JSON data with someone, I can simply click \"Share\" to generate a link instead of sending a file. I just send the link to the other person, and even better, when they open it, the JSON data is already neatly formatted. I think this is absolutely awesome!\n\nAdditionally, the link has a one-hour expiration time, after which it becomes inaccessible, ensuring the data remains highly secure.\nI continued exploring and discovered that it not only enables quick sharing but also allows you to rapidly generate an API for temporary testing during development. This is incredibly convenient!\n\nActually, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also run queries here to extract the data I need from the entire JSON dataset, supporting various query languages.\n\nIn addition to standard JavaScript code, it also supports JEMSPath, JSONPath, JQ Cmd \n\nSecondly, it also supports data conversion, allowing seamless transformation between JSON and other data formats, including JS Object, JSON5, JSON Schema,  Query String, Typescript,  Postman Bulk, MXL, YML.\n\nYou can manually convert data or directly paste non-JSON data, and it will automatically generate the converted JSON data. For example, you can simply paste the following data:\n<name>DEV</name>\n\n\nAdditionally, it can validate whether the provided JSON data meets specific structural requirements, supporting JSON Schema and JSON Type Definition.\n\nAnother feature we frequently use is: JSON Diff\n\nIn short, I think this tool is an essential asset for programmers, and I’m sharing it with everyone here Online JSON Format Tool",

          "description": "Testing Android apps is challenging because the ecosystem is highly fragmented. Devices come in different screen sizes, hardware configurations, and Android versions, leading to inconsistencies in how apps behave. A feature that works smoothly on one phone might not function similarly on another due to manufacturer customizations, performance limitations, or OS-specific restrictions.\nNetwork conditions add another layer of complexity. An app that loads quickly on Wi-Fi might become unresponsive on slow mobile data or in areas with weak signals.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at a common problem that arises when executing Bash scripts that require arguments with spaces, and how to resolve it effectively.\nWhy Does This Issue Occur?\nWhen a Bash script accepts parameters from the command line, any spaces in the path can lead to misinterpretation of the provided argument. Bash treats spaces as delimiters, which separates the string into distinct arguments, resulting in errors when the script is executed.
