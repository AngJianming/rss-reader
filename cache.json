          "author": "Hej Hdiss",
          "description": "As someone passionate about programming and curious about how languages can work together, I’ve been developing an idea for a new kind of language—a hybrid that lets you write C and Python side-by-side in the same script, with simple code-level links between them. I call it the Python-C Linked Language (PCL).\nIn a .pcl file, you could define C code in one block, Python code in another, and link them effortlessly using a few special directives. For example:\n%c  name=mylib   export(add, Vec)\ntypedef struct {\nint add(int a, int b) {\n%py   requires(mylib)   import(add, Vec)\nv = Vec(1.0, 2.0)\nprint(\"Vector (x, y):\", v.x, v.y)\n\n%endpy\nThis format keeps C and Python clean, separate, and readable, while the compiler handles symbol exporting, struct mapping, and wrapper generation automatically using tools like ctypes, pycparser, or cffi.\nWhile exploring this idea, I naturally looked at existing solutions like Cython and Mojo. Cython is incredibly powerful for performance, but it blends Python and C-like syntax within the same code block, which can make the code harder to follow. Mojo, on the other hand, is a new language with its own syntax focused on high performance, especially for AI workloads. My idea with PCL is different: instead of learning a new language or mixing syntax styles, you simply write native C and native Python as separate blocks and link them through simple export() and import() tags. This keeps both languages in their original, familiar form—just more connected.\nI’m still at the early stages of learning compiler design, but this concept excites me deeply. I believe it could help developers build efficient, readable, and modular hybrid programs more easily. If anyone has experience in C/Python integration, language tooling, or compiler internals, I’d love to hear your thoughts—or even collaborate.\nWould a language like this be useful to you?\n\n\n  \n  \n  programming #python #cprogramming #compiler #cython #mojo #opensource #devtools #learning #hybridlanguage",

According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.\nThe company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”\nRelated: Circle co-founder to create ‘AI-native’ bank after $18M raise\nUSDC market share\nWith a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).\nStablecoins by market cap.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.\nIt set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.\nHere are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).\nBitcoin has stormed back since dropping to 2025 lows of $76,300 in April.
