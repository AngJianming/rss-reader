Now, it's time to build out the server-side infrastructure to handle these uploads effectively. In this tutorial, we'll create a backend system that not only receives and stores images but also manages their metadata and serves them back to our application. We'll cover setting up file storage, integrating with a database to track image information, and creating endpoints that return essential image data like storage locations. Let's dive into building a complete image management system with Node.js.\nSo, what is the idea? Ok, we will create a separate route that will accept the image, send the file to the storage, and then return some data about that file to the frontend. On the frontend, we will g‚Ä¶",
