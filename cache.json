It’s all about guiding the AI, step by step.\nBefore I even type my first prompt, I try to understand the AI model itself. Is it a language model, an image generator, or something else? What kind of data was it trained on? Knowing its strengths (and more importantly, its weaknesses) helps me set realistic expectations. I also dig into the API documentation to see what parameters I can tweak — things like temperature (how creative or \"safe\" the response is) or max_tokens (how long the response can be). These are my knobs and dials for fine-tuning.\nTreat your AI like a junior developer: give it clear instructions, context, and examples, and it’ll surprise you with what it can achieve.\n…",

This might include missing deadlines, not submitting necessary paperwork, or allowing the case to sit without progress.\nCourts expect parties to stay engaged and push their cases forward.
