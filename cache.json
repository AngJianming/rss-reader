To help you work smarter, not harder, here are 5 lesser-known Linux commands that can seriously simplify your daily tasks ‚Äî with examples you can try right now.\nFor the other 5, check out the full article on Medium:\n10 Linux Commands That Will Simplify Your Workflow\nThe traditional man pages are detailed but often overwhelming. tldr gives you concise, example-based explanations to quickly get you up to speed.\nInstall:\nsudo apt install tldr      # Debian/Ubuntu\n# or\nbrew install tldr          # macOS with Homebrew\n\nUsage:\ntldr tar\n\nOutput:\n# Create a tar archive\ntar -cf archive.tar file1 file2\n\n# Extract a tar archive\ntar -xf archive.tar\n\nSometimes commands hang or take too long. Use timeout to automatically stop a command after a set period.\nExample: Ping Google for 5 seconds only\ntimeout 5s ping google.com\n\nAfter 5 seconds, the ping stops, freeing up your terminal.\nInstead of parsing du output, ncdu lets you navigate your disk usage in an interactive UI and delete large files right from the interface.\nInstall:\nsudo apt install ncdu\n\nRun:\nncdu /\n\nUse arrow keys to browse and delete files easily.\nfind is powerful but complex. fd is a modern alternative with simpler syntax and faster performance.\nInstall:\nsudo apt install fd-find\n\nUsage:\nfd notes.txt\nfd -e py          # find Python files\nfd config /etc    # search within /etc\n\nAccidental deletes are painful. trash-cli sends files to your trash bin instead of permanently removing them.\nInstall:\nsudo apt install trash-cli\n\nUsage:\ntrash myfile.txt          # moves file to trash\ntrash *.log               # trash multiple files\ntrash-restore             # recover files from trash\n\nThese 5 commands are just the beginning!
