It occurs when a caching system ‚Äî such as a reverse proxy or CDN ‚Äî can be tricked into caching sensitive, dynamic content that should only be delivered to authenticated users but ends up being publicly available. This is usually due to poorly thought-out or inconsistent configurations in how the cache interprets and stores different types of requests.\nMany caching systems have simple rules for deciding what can and cannot be cached. A common pattern is to only cache \"static\" files ‚Äî such as those ending in .js, .css, .png, .ico, etc. The problem arises when the cache relies solely on the structure of the URL path to make this decision, ignoring the actual behavior of the server behind it.\nImagine this: the caching system is in‚Ä¶",

Bloated images lead to slower CI/CD pipelines, larger attack surfaces, and higher cloud bills. But what if you could cut a 1GB image down to just 30MB? üöÄ\nBy combining Multi-Stage Builds with slim or distroless base images, you can drastically reduce image size without sacrificing functionality or speed.\n\nMulti-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. This lets you separate the build environment (which might be heavy with tools and dependencies) from the runtime environment (which should be as slim as possible).\nBuild Stage:\n\n\nStart with a full-featured image like golang, node, or even ubuntu.\nFROM golang:1.20 AS builder\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . .\nRUN go build -o myapp\n\nProduction Stage:\n\n\nUse a lightweight or distroless base image like alpine or Google's gcr.io/distroless/base.\nFROM alpine:latest\n\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY --from=builder /app/myapp .\n\nCMD [\"./myapp\"]\n\nüìâ Result:\n15MB!\nSmaller size ‚Üí Faster deployments and fewer storage costs.\nLower attack surface ‚Üí Minimal OS footprint means fewer vulnerabilities.\nBetter performance ‚Üí Streamlined startup and resource consumption.\nFROM gcr.io/distroless/static\nCOPY --from=builder /app/myapp /\nCMD [\"/myapp\"]\n\nFinal size?

That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.\nGPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.\nWhile GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable.
