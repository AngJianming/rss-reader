You might be trying to create an evenly spaced design, intending to ensure that each of your rows takes up equal height. However, as you've noticed, issues can arise when the container's height is constrained, leading to unexpected results such as uneven row heights.\nIn your example, you specified:\ngrid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));\n\nThis CSS rule is designed to create as many rows as can fit in the defined space, each with a minimum height of 100px and a maximum height of 1fr (fractional unit).
