          "description": "Imagine searching for a book on databases in a massive library with thousands of books. Without organization, finding that book could take hours. This is where indexes come in, both in libraries and databases. In this post, we’ll use a library analogy to explain why indexes are essential for efficient data retrieval in relational databases, focusing on books about databases.\nPicture a library where thousands of books are stacked randomly—no labeled sections, no catalog. To find a book like Database Internals, you’d need to check the title of nearly every book. This is slow and inefficient, much like searching a database without an index.\nIn a relational database, the library is the database, each book is a row in a table, and the table might look like this:\n\n\n\nBook Title\n\n\n\n\nDatabase Inter…",

This is his way of saying, \"I feel the need to spend a moment outside. Or, if you'd rather not get up, I could leave something on the hallway rug for you to discover later.\" Quickly evaluating which scenario would start my week on a high note, I got up to let him out, leaving me thoroughly awake much too early.

After analyzing the solution with AI I learned that the same problem can be solved with an Arrow function implementation, which reduces the runtime to 32ms.\nOne can say that you can find hundreds of solutions online, but it’s not about solutions on platforms like Leetcode; it’s about the skill to solve problems better.\nI have one rule when solving problems: don’t ask AI for solutions.\nI ask for bits and pieces when I get stuck, but to put everything together into an actual solution is always my job.\nThis keeps me confident in my own capabilities and helps me learn better with AI — because Leetcode isn’t about finding solutions, but about developing the skill to solve problems.",

If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. \nOver the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. \nIt i…",

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.\nIn this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.\n\nAs of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…",
