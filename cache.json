But spreadsheets will no longer be useful if you have an increasing number of assets, which, even worse, need to be updated frequently, daily, hourly, to match the company workflow. At this point, you will need a proper IT asset management tool to handle the tasks.\nThis is where IT asset management (ITAM) cloud software steps in. In 2025, these cloud-based tools are more powerful than ever, leveraging automation, real-time insights, and accessibility to streamline operations, ensure compliance, and cut costs.\nIn this article, we‚Äôll compare the top five IT asset management cloud software solutions for 2025.
