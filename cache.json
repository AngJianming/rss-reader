Today’s topic is a favorite among devs and job recruiters alike — Open Source Contributions.\nYes, it sounds intimidating. But trust me — you don’t need to be a 10x developer or a command-line wizard to contribute meaningfully. Let’s break it down!\nLearn by doing – Hands-on experience beats theory any day.\nBuild your portfolio – Real-world code > tutorial projects.\nGrow your network – Meet collaborators, mentors, and friends.\nGive back to the community – Many of the tools you use daily are open source!\n\nGood First Issue – Curated list of beginner-friendly issues\nUp-for-Grabs\nFirst Contributions Repo\nExplore trending repos on GitHub – Look under the “issues” tab for low-hanging fruit.\nYou don’t need to refactor the entire codebase. Open source thrives on small, meaningful contributions. Examples:\nFixing typos in documentation\nImproving README files\nUpdating dependencies\nFixing bugs\nAdding tests\nSuggesting features\nReviewing other people’s PRs\nFork the repo 🍴\n\n\nClone it locally\n\n\n\n\n   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git\n\nCreate a new branch\n\n\n\n\n   git checkout -b fix-typo\n\nMake your changes & commit\n\n\n\n\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Fix typo in README\"\n\nPush to your fork\n\n\n\n\n   git push origin fix-typo\n\nOpen a Pull Request (PR)\nExplain what you did clearly.\nBe polite and open to feedback!\nRead the Contributing.md file if available.\nFollow code style guidelines of the project.\nEngage positively in issue discussions.\nBe patient — maintainers are often volunteers!\nEvery October, GitHub and DigitalOcean host Hacktoberfest, where contributing to open source earns you swag, stickers, and GitHub street cred. Perfect for beginners!\n\nYou just finished a 5-day journey covering:\nWhat is GitHub\nSetting up GitHub & Git\nBranching and Collaboration\nGitHub Actions for Automation\nOpen Source Contributions\nWhether you're building solo or contributing globally, GitHub is your dev playground.",

These aren’t just fancy syntax tricks, they’re the backbone of how Python objects behave and interact.\nBut before we get into specific methods like __init__ or __len__, we need to understand the big picture. What are special methods really? Why do they exist? And why are they so central to writing truly Pythonic code?\nLet’s unpack it all.\nSpecial methods are methods in Python that start and end with double underscores.

The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. \nThe regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. \nIrina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution. \n“Issuing real-world asset tokens a…",

The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.\nUnfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.\n                 …",
