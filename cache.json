Since you don’t want to hard-code the notification logic, it’s better to allow the user to register a custom function that will be called automatically after the data processing completes.\nstd::function for callback registration\n\n\nOne of the most flexible ways to implement callbacks in C++ is by using std::function. std::function can store and invoke any callable object (functions, lambdas, or function objects) that matches a specific signature. The overall syntax is:\nstd::function<function_return_type(function_argument_types)> name;\n\nLet’s define a ProcessData unction that accepts a callback and notifies the user once processing is complete.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <functional>\n// Type alias for the callback type\nusing CallbackType = std::function<void(const bool)>;\n// Function accepting callback as an argument\nvoid ProcessData(const CallbackType& callback) {\n    // Simulate data processing\n    std::cout << \"Processing data\" << std::endl;\n    // Notify user via callback\n    callback(true);\n}\n// Callback function definition\nvoid Callback(const bool result) {\n    std::cout << \"Callback called! Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Register a callback using an existing function\n    ProcessData(Callback);\n    // Register a callback using lambda function\n    ProcessData([](const bool result) {\n        std::cout << \"Lambda called! Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n    });\n    // Register using callable object\n    CallbackType cb = [](const bool result){\n        std::cout << \"Callable called! Result: \" << result << std::endl;\n    };\n    ProcessData(cb);\n}",
