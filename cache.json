          "description": "When people hear the term blockchain, their first thought is usually Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. However, blockchain is much more than just digital money. It is a revolutionary technology that is reshaping industries from finance and supply chain management to healthcare and cybersecurity. For students in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), blockchain offers exciting career paths and innovation opportunities far beyond cryptocurrency.\nAt its core, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records data across many computers in such a way that the registered data cannot be altered retroactively. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every new transaction is recorded in a new block and linked to the previous one ‚Äî creating a secure and transpar‚Ä¶",

Now, I write code like this:\nWrite a failing test (Red)\nMake it pass with minimal code (Green)\nClean up without fear (Refactor)\nAnd guess what?
