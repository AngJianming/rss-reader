I guess it's time to give it a go!\nFirst step is to register here, then you have to wait for the Builder Pack, which includes a free Bolt.new Pro subscription and other goodies. Given that more than 60k participants have registered it might take some time!\nWhile waiting for receiving the email, it's time to brainstorm and plan.\nThis is going to be fun, more on that tomorrow when I (hopefully) receive the builder pack and register the domain name.\nWhile I am proficient using React and Nextjs, I see this hackathon as an opportunity to try something new. I want to give building mobile applications a go and/or learn a new framework.\nI hesitated between Nuxt + Capacitor and Expo to build a cross platform app easily and decided to go the Expo route.\nFor the backend I'm going to use something new too, Appwrite! I am familiar with Supabase, Convex, and Firebase but never given that one a shot, it looks promising.\nThat's it for today, see you tomorrow for day 2 üöÄ",

It powers:\nAutomated test case generation\nAnomaly detection in test data\nPredictive defect analysis\nHowever, human expertise is still essential for validating AI outputs and handling edge cases.\nWhile automation handles repetition, exploratory testing brings creativity, intuition, and experience into play. It‚Äôs especially powerful for:\nUX validation\nIdentifying gaps automation misses\nTesting real-world user flows\nExploratory testing bridges the gap between scripts and user empathy.\nWith rising data regulations (like GDPR, HIPAA), security testing is mandatory ‚Äî from static code analysis to penetration testing.\nLikewise, accessibility testing ensures inclusive design:\nUse WCAG guidelines\nTest with screen readers\nValidate color contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.\nAccessible software = better UX + legal compliance.\nGreat testing fails without realistic, privacy-compliant test data. Teams must:\nMask sensitive info\nGenerate synthetic data for edge cases\nManage data sets for repeatability\nTest data is no longer a backend concern ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of test strategy.\nSoftware testing in 2025 is less about \"testing more\" and more about \"testing smarter.\" That means:\nCross-functional collaboration\nData-informed prioritization\nEmbracing change and lifelong learning\nTesters today are quality advocates, not just bug finders.\nLet‚Äôs connect and share insights!",
