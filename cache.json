          "description": "JavaScript es uno de los lenguajes de programación más importantes y utilizados en el desarrollo web moderno. Pero, ¿sabías cómo y cuándo comenzó todo? En este artículo te resumo la fascinante historia de JavaScript.\nJavaScript fue creado en 1995 por Brendan Eich, mientras trabajaba en Netscape Communications. Originalmente llamado Mocha y luego LiveScript, su objetivo era permitir interactividad en las páginas web, algo revolucionario para la época. En solo 10 días, Eich desarrolló la primera versión de JavaScript, que se integró en el navegador Netscape Navigator.\nDesde entonces, JavaScript ha evolucionado enormemente. Inicialmente fue criticado por sus limitaciones y diferencias entre navegadores, pero su estandarización a través de ECMAScript y el apoyo de la comunidad hicieron que se convirtiera en un pilar para el desarrollo web. Hoy, con frameworks y librerías como React, Angular y Node.js, JavaScript no solo se usa en navegadores sino también en servidores, aplicaciones móviles y mucho más.\nEste recorrido histórico nos muestra cómo JavaScript pasó de ser un simple lenguaje de scripting a una herramienta fundamental que impulsa gran parte de la experiencia web actual.",
