          "description": "The German ad agency search platform AgenturTipp has launched it's yearly SEO contest ‚Äì and this year's keyword to rank for is \"Keywordk√∂nig\" (German for keyword king). The goal: get the highest possible ranking for this keyword within 4 weeks. Here's how Agentur ID is doing it.\nFor our entry to the Keywordk√∂nig contest, we rely on some SEO essentials, as well as trying out how our headless CMS fares with search engines.\nHigh quality content, written by professional copywriters\nSome AI content to enhance user experience (e.g. videos)\nInteractive elements to encourage dwell time\nBacklinks from reputable PR websites and partners\nMentions on Social Media, LinkedIn, Medium, DEV, ...\nSubdomain with the keyword in the URL\nStructured Data (JSON, schema.org)\nRather than spamming the web with yet another AI generated website, we believe that real content, written by real people, will be the way to go for SEO and GEO alike.\nOur main goal is to thoroughly test our headless CMS. It's a custom system based on react. In our experience, it's harder to start ranking with a headless CMS or Single Page Applications, but it's also more sustainable. A main factor for the sustainability of the rankings is the persistent performance for mobile and desktop devices.\nThere is three reasons for this post on DEV:\nWe want to keep our contest participation transparent.\nLLMs love structured posts ‚Äì so we want to test what impact this post will have on our GEO visibility.\nIt keeps us accountable! Once the contest is over, I will post some key findings from our participation.\nHead over to our Keywordk√∂nig web page to learn more about our SEO approach.\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nOr go to our Agentur ID web page\nAlso, feel free to contact me on DEV or on LinkedIn!",

Tenang, lu gak sendirian!\nGua juga pernah ngalamin, kok. Dulu, saking ambisnya pengen jadi rockstar engineer, gua lupa sama yang namanya kehidupan sosial.
