          "description": "Welcome 👋!\nWhen you're building blazingly fast WASM apps, there's one thing that silently makes or breaks the user experience: loading states. We've all been there, blank screens, layout jumps, etc. It's not just bad UX. It's lost trust.\nThat's why we're excited today to introduce Skeleton RS , a highly-configurable skeleton loader built natively for Rust WASM frameworks, starting with full Yew support. Think of it as a smart placeholder for your content , one that speaks fluent WASM.\nLet's unpack why Skeleton RS is your new best friend when it comes to loading UIs 🦴.\n\nSkeleton RS is a high-performance skeleton loader component designed for frontend Rust frameworks like Yew.

Instead of forcing the domain to fit the code, we adapt the code to represent the domain.\nKey components of DDD:\nEntities: Objects with identity (e.g., a User).\nValue Objects: Objects without identity, defined by their attributes (Email, Money).\nAggregates: Consistency boundaries grouping related entities.\nRepositories: Abstractions for accessing aggreg…",

They empower innovation, enable microservices, and facilitate seamless integrations. But with this power comes a critical responsibility: 𝘀𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆.\nOne of the most underestimated aspects of API security is 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁. It’s not just about authentication-knowing 𝘄𝗵𝗼 is calling your API-but also about 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 they are allowed to do. Properly implemented permissions ensure that users and systems only access the resources and operations they are authorized for, reducing the risk of data leaks and malicious actions.\nAs backend engineers, we must go beyond the basics. Fine-grained permissions, role-based access control (RBAC), and the principle of least privilege are essential strategies. These not only protect sensitive data but also build trust with your users and clients.\nAre you confident that your APIs are granting the right permissions to the right actors? How do you handle permission updates as your system evolves? Let’s share our experiences and best practices!\n👇 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁’𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀?

Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.\nIt’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…",

PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. \nThe plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. \n“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.

          "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement approach on crypto firms has left a lasting “regulatory overhang” within the industry, according to Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea. \nSpeaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”\nThe SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities.
