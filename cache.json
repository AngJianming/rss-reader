          "description": "How AI Chatbots Are Changing the Game (And Why Your Business Needs One)\n\n\nLet's be real — in 2025, if you're not using an AI chatbot, you're already behind.\nChatbots aren’t just some techy trend anymore — they’re the secret weapon smart businesses are using to connect, sell, and support around the clock.\nThink of an AI chatbot as a virtual assistant that’s always awake, always polite, and never asks for a coffee break. ☕\nNo scripts. No boring robotic replies. The best bots actually talk like humans now. Cool, right?\nHere’s why you’re seeing chatbots everywhere:\nAlways Online: Your chatbot doesn’t need sleep — it’s available 24/7 for your customers.\nSave Big Money: Instead of hiring huge support teams, a single bot can handle hundreds (even thousands) of conversations at once.\nInstant Responses: No more customers waiting on hold or unanswered DMs.\nFeels Personal: Today’s bots can remember past conversations and make users feel like they’re chatting with a real person.\nAnd let’s be honest — when customers get instant help, they’re way more likely to stick around and buy.\n📞 Customer Service: Help people out without lifting a finger.\n🛒 Boost Sales: Recommend products and close more deals automatically.\n📅 Appointments: Let customers book meetings without back-and-forth emails.\n📈 Lead Generation: Find your next big client through a casual chatbot convo.\nAI is moving fast — like, \"blink and you'll miss it\" fast.\nExperts believe that within just a few years, bots will handle about 90% of customer conversations.\nIt’s simpler than you think:\nDecide what you need — Sales? Support? Lead generation?\nPick a platform — There are tons of great ones like Dialogflow, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Bot Framework.\nPlan your conversations — Make it fun, helpful, and easy to use.\nTest and tweak — Your first version won’t be perfect. That’s okay!\n✨ At Aerobyte Innovations, we build custom chatbots that actually sound human (because boring bots are bad for business).\nLet’s chat!",

          "description": "Credited to: Charles Martinez\nRecently, I had to look into a few ways to embed a chart into Rails mailer views. Most of the time, I just use chartkick because its simple and easy to use. But in mailers, Chartkick can’t be used directly, so you have to embed an image of the chart for it to work.\nAfter a while, I bumped into QuickChart an Open Source library to generate chart images by just generating the url with the correct query parameters. And it offers a lot of chart options https://quickchart.io/gallery/\nhttps://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'bar',data:{labels:['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'], datasets:[{label:'Users',data:[50,60,70,180]},{label:'Revenue',data:[100,200,300,400]}]}}\n\nAnd another thing, there’s also a gem that acts as a Ruby client for QuickChart -https://github.com/typpo/quickchart-ruby\nu/chart = QuickChart.new(\n  {\n    type: 'bar',\n    data: {\n      labels: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'],\n      datasets: [\n        {\n          label: 'Users',\n          data: [50, 100, 120, 150]\n        },\n        {\n          label: 'Revenue',\n          data: [100, 200, 300, 450]\n        },\n      ]\n    },\n    options: {\n      title: {\n        display: true,\n        text: 'Users vs Revenue',\n        fontSize: 16,\n        padding: 16,\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n\nAnd then render the URL of that object in your Mailer View.\n# apps/views/sample_mailer/sample_email.html.erb\n\n<img src=\"<%= @chart.get_url %>\">\n\n\n\nAnd that’s it! You can now embed and render charts in your Mailer Views. Very simple and quick to implement.",
