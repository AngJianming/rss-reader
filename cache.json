The market has decided to kick me out.\nI'm overexaggerating, but this was an industry I fought since college to get into. \nI love software engineering. \nThe joy of solving problems, digging into solutions with other people, and figuring out creative approaches to an algorithm during a brisk walk. These are what got me up in the morning to work, even though it never felt like work.\nI'm starting to believe now that I merely got lucky in finding a software engineering job. I was hired during the COVID market, which was a great time for developers. \nI was getting callbacks, left and right, turning down opportunities, negotiating significant salary bumps.\nNow here I am, sitting here discouraged from reading Reddit and LinkedIn about all the tech layoffs. Shortly after being let go, I read a message from a previous colleague on their alumni Slack channel about how he hasn't found a job in almost a year and could soon lose his house.\nI'm not a very positive person, as you may tell. My previous posts have always been positive and lighthearted, encouraging people to never give up. I need to take my own advice.\nIt's harder now that I have a little girl to take care of.\nI have enjoyed watching my daughter throughout the day, loved it in fact. But at the same time, I can't help but stress what the future holds for me in this career.\nThe best thing right now, keep going.",
