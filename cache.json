          "description": "TL;DR: MachineGames—the studio behind Indiana Jones and The Great Circle (VGOTY 2024) and Wolfenstein II—has quietly axed an unannounced game, according to a LinkedIn post spotted by a Twitter user. No clues on what the project was—fans hoping for Wolfenstein 3 (given the cliffhanger in New Colossus) will have to keep dreaming.\nMeanwhile, MachineGames is busy cooking up DLC for Indiana Jones and, with Microsoft’s ZeniMax takeover backing them, there’s plenty of $$$ and talent for future sequels (Jones 2 or Wolf 3?). Until the studio spills more beans, the mystery title remains buried.",

          "description": "TL;DR: In their latest SEC 10-K filings, EA and Take-Two are flagging a new kind of risk: reputational and legal fallout from weaving AI (especially generative AI) into game development and business processes. They warn that if they mishandle “social and ethical issues” around AI, it could erode player trust and damage their brands—so they’ve tacked it onto their usual laundry list of industry risks (think pandemics, internet outages, franchise dependence, etc.).\nMost big studios (yes, even Nintendo) are dabbling in AI at the concept stage, and regulators make public companies call out anything that might hurt the bottom line. Execs like Take-Two’s Strauss Zelnick see AI as a booster for efficiency—not a job killer or creative substitute—while acknowledging these digital tools bring both promise and potential headaches.",

          "description": "TL;DR: A team from Samsung Electronics and POSTECH has created a super-thin (500 µm) single-layer waveguide display for AR eyewear by using achromatic metagratings—arrays of nanoscale gratings that diffract red, green and blue light at the same angle. Unlike bulky, multi-layer waveguides (or earlier metasurface attempts), this design slashes weight and size while boosting brightness, color uniformity and user comfort.\nThey used a custom stochastic topology-optimization algorithm to fine-tune the nanostructures, achieving high-quality, full-color images without chromatic distortion. The result is a more compact, ergonomic AR headset platform that could soon bring crisp digital overlays to everyday glasses.",

What began as a passion-driven VR blog in 2016 thrived through the Quest 2 boom and Metaverse hype—only to be crushed by a 90% traffic drop from a Google core update. Falling ad revenue, shrinking Plus subscriptions and a youth-driven shift toward TikTok and YouTube turned a vicious cycle into an inevitable end for the site in its current form.\nDespite MIXED’s closure, Tomislav remains optimistic about VR’s future. He sees an industry still in its infancy—fragile, dominated by one marketplace, but ripe for innovation as “VR natives” grow up. He’s off to write about XR at Heise Online, grateful to readers and eager to follow the next chapter of virtual reality.",

AI Mode in Search, which dynamically spins up custom results pages—complete with charts and mini-apps—and will gradually fold into regular Google Search. Pichai says these new AI products mark “research becoming reality,” and he’s confident they’ll finally deliver returns on Google’s years of AI investment.\nThey also tackled the hot-button issues: publishers (backed by the News Media Alliance) screaming “theft” over AI summaries, future AR eyewear from Project Moohan, the big OpenAI–Jony Ive hardware deal, and looming antitrust battles—most notably the DOJ’s push to spin off Chrome. Through it all, Pichai insists Google’s committed to sending more traffic to the open web and won’t tweak search results for political pressures.",
