          "description": "I used to think being “good at receiving feedback” meant nodding politely, taking notes, and promising to do better. But over time, I've learned that how we receive feedback can shape our entire trajectory-and it goes far beyond politeness.\nWhen feedback lands, especially the kind that catches you off guard or stings a little, it has a way of stirring up questions: Am I failing? Am I not as good as I thought? Do they still trust me?\nIt's easy to get defensive. Or spiral. Or overcorrect so hard that we lose touch with our instincts. But here's what I've come to believe: receiving feedback well isn't about blindly accepting everything, nor is it about shielding yourself from discomfort. It's about staying centered while making room for growth.\nHere's what I've learned along the way:\nPause be…",

          "description": "By Pratham Gupta | Founder @ Epyq\nWelcome to Episode 4 of AGI Showdowner. After understanding how AGI senses its environment, it’s time to dive into how it remembers, learns, and evolves — the Memory Systems. Spoiler: This is where true intelligence starts flexing its muscles.\nMemory Systems in AGI manage the storage, retrieval, and updating of knowledge over time. Unlike simple data dumps, AGI’s memory is dynamic, contextual, and designed for continual learning.\nHierarchical Memory: Short-term, long-term, and working memory layers that mimic human cognition for efficient recall and reasoning.\n\n\nContextual Storage: Memories are tagged with situational context, allowing AGI to recall relevant info quickly.\n\n\nAdaptive Forgetting: Not all memories are useful forever — irrelevant or obsolete data is pruned intelligently to optimize resources.\n\n\nSelf-Evolving Knowledge: Memory is not static; it adapts based on new experiences and feedback.\n\n\nOffline and Online Sync: AGI can store and update memories offline, syncing seamlessly when online to leverage cloud resources.\nWithout robust Memory Systems, AGI would be a short-sighted calculator, unable to build on past experiences or plan for the future. Memory is the backbone of learning and adaptation.\nInputs from perception and reasoning are stored in layered memory modules.\n\nRetrieval mechanisms prioritize contextually relevant memories for current tasks.\n\nPeriodic pruning maintains efficiency.\n\nSync protocols ensure memory consistency across offline and online states.\nEpisode 5 will wrap up our AGI Showdowner series and introduce the Epyq Protocol — the ethical and operational foundation behind our AGI blueprint.\nMemory isn’t just storage; it’s the engine of growth. Master this, and your AGI stops being reactive and starts becoming proactive.\n#AGIShowdowner #MemorySystems #AGI #Epyq #AIRevolution #LearningAI\n— Pratham Gupta, Founder @ Epyq",

Then compares it to all other elements to see if it is.\nFor example, in the first iteration of the nested loop, the algorithm will take index y value and compare it with smallest value index, and if the current index value(y) is smaller than the smallest index value, then the algorithm will set y index as the…",
