I followed countless courses, watched endless tutorials, joined bootcamps, and consumed a mountain of content. And yet… I didn’t feel like I was actually getting better.\nI knew more, but I couldn’t do more. And that’s a frustrating place to be.\nThe Trap of Passive Learning\nIt became clear: knowledge without experience wasn’t enough.\nThe Shift: Build Something Real\nThat’s when I started working on Onepin, a tool where users can pin and manage anything important to them in one place.\nUnlike tutorials that hand you the solution, this project gave me no safety net.

For a long time, software engineering felt like a safe bet. After all, how could we be automated away when we’re the ones writing the automation? Or so we thought.\nLike many, I’ve run the full gamut of emotions on the topic: excitement, uncertainty, fear, frustration, more excitement, more uncertainty, and so on. If there's an emotional response to AI to be had, I’ve probably felt it. But lately, one emotion has consistently stuck, and that’s excitement.\nIt took a while to get here (and arguably even longer to learn to stay here) but I can now say with confidence: the rise of AI excites me more than an…",
