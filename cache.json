On May 15, 2025, Optimajet released FormEngine Core 4.0, making essential libraries available under the permissive MIT license free even for commercial use. FormEngine is now the leading alternative to React Hook Form, especially for teams building complex, interactive forms.\nWhy switch from React Hook Form to FormEngine?\nReact Hook Form requires extensive manual setup of controllers, hooks, and validation logic. FormEngine simplifies this by leveraging intuitive, schema-based definitions.\nUnlike React Hook Form‚Äôs code-only approach, FormEngine includes an intuitive visual editor, allowing instant form creation and modification, significantly speeding up development.

In this blog, I will share what I learned today with simple explanations.\nJavaScript is used to make websites interactive and dynamic. HTML gives structure, CSS gives style, but JavaScript adds life to the website.\nShowing alert messages\nCreating sliders or animations\nValidating forms (like checking if email is correct)\nBuilding real-time updates without refreshing the page\nA function is a block of code that performs a specific task.\nto avoid repeating code. Instead of writing the same code again and again, we write it once in a function and call it wherever needed.\nExample:\nfunction greet() {\n  console.log(\"Hello, welcome to my blog!\");\n}\n\nThis function will print a welcome message.\nhow to call this function.\nTo run (or call) a function, just write the function name followed by parentheses ().\nExample:\ngreet(); // This will print: Hello, welcome to my blog!\n\nSo, whenever you write greet();, it runs the code inside the function.\nVariables are containers for storing data.\nvar (older)\nlet (modern and recommended)\nconst (for values that should not change)\nExample:\nlet name = \"John\";\nconst age = 25;\nvar city = \"Mumbai\";\n\n\n\n\nKeyword\nScope\nCan Reassign\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nvar\nFunction\nYes\nOlder and not recommended much\n\n\nlet\nBlock\nYes\nUsed when value can change\n\n\nconst\nBlock\nNo\nUsed when value should stay same\n\n\n\nJavaScript has two main types of data:\nString ‚Üí \"Hello\"\n\n\nNumber ‚Üí 42, 3.14\n\n\nBoolean ‚Üí true or false\n\n\nNull ‚Üí No value\nUndefined ‚Üí Not assigned yet\nSymbol ‚Üí Unique values (advanced)\nBigInt ‚Üí Large numbers\nObject ‚Üí {name: \"John\", age: 25}\n\n\nArray ‚Üí [\"apple\", \"banana\"]\n\n\nFunction ‚Üí Reusable block of code\nData types help the browser understand what kind of data we are using.\nA number is used for calculations.\nA string is used for text.\nA boolean is used for conditions (true or false).\nThis helps JavaScript work smoothly and avoid errors.",

This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition as a deflationary asset.\nAs of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.\nThe reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin‚Äôs exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving.
