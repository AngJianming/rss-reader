Two popular infrastructure components that help tackle these challenges are API Gateways and Service Meshes. While both deal with communication and traffic management in distributed systems, they serve distinct roles and operate at different layers of the application stack.\nIn this article, we‚Äôll explore the key differences between API Gateways and Service Meshes, their purposes, features, and when you might use one‚Äîor both‚Äîin your architecture.\nAn API Gateway is the single entry point for external clients (such as mobile apps, frontend applications, or third-party systems) to access backend services in a microservic‚Ä¶",

Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones.¬†\nThe finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia‚Äôs DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes.
