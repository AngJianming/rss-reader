          "description": "Hey problem solvers! 🎯\nToday we’re tackling a fun and elegant problem from LeetCode — 3423: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array. This one checks your understanding of array boundaries and circular behavior. Let’s break it down. 🔍\nYou're given a circular array nums, and your task is to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, where:\nThe first and last elements are also considered adjacent (because it's circular).\nYou return the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers.\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n|1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 4| = 2, |4 - 1| = 3.\n3.\nThe array is circular, so both regular adjacent pairs and the pair between the last and first element must be considered.\nInitialize ans with |nums[0] - nums[n-1]|.\nIterate through the array and compute |nums[i] - nums[i+1]| for all valid i.\nReturn the maximum of all these values.\nclass Solution {\n public:\n  int maxAdjacentDistance(vector<int>& nums) {\n    int ans = abs(nums.front() - nums.back());\n\n    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i)\n      ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n\n    return ans;\n  }\n};\n\nvar maxAdjacentDistance = function(nums) {\n    let ans = Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[nums.length - 1]);\n\n    for (let i = 0; i + 1 < nums.length; ++i) {\n        ans = Math.max(ans, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n};\n\ndef maxAdjacentDistance(nums):\n    ans = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])\n\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n        ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))\n\n    return ans\n\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: nums = [-5, -10, -5]\nOutput: 5\n\nInput: nums = [0, 100, -100]\nOutput: 200\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array\nSpace Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space\n\nThis is a great warm-up problem to train your attention to edge conditions like circular connections. Simple logic and clean implementation go a long way here.\nIf this guide helped you, drop a ❤️ and follow for more beginner-friendly coding guides!\nHappy coding! 🚀",

However, as organizations increasingly sought to leverage both traditional BI and advanced analytics, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), the limitations of this bifurcated approach became glaring.

For anyone who’s wrestled with the question of whether to split each customer into their own database instance or try to multiplex everyone into a single shared set of tables, the trade-offs become stark as usage grows. Logical isolation, operational simplicity, and real query performance all pull in different directions.\nIn the vector space, the equivalent of a relational table is the collection—each with its own schema, index, and access boundaries.
