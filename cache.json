          "description": "React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs), especially for single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in web development.\nComponent-Based: UIs are built using components, which are reusable pieces of code that define how a part of the interface should look and behave.\nJSX Syntax: Uses a special syntax called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering. Instead of updating the real DOM directly, it updates a lightweight copy first, then efficiently updates only the parts that changed.\nUnidirectional Data Flow: Data in React flows in one direction, making it easier to understand and debug applications.…",

You’d give them a  valet key  — a key that lets them do one specific thing and nothing else.\nOAuth 2.0 works the same way in the digital world.  It’s a secure authorization protocol that lets applications access specific user resources without ever sharing the user’s password.
