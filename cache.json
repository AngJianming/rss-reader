You could be troubleshooting a crash, monitoring a deployment, or just keeping an eye on system health and waiting for a massive log file to fully open is the last thing you need.\nSometimes, all you care about is what just happened.\nThat's where the tail command shines. It's your window into the most recent activity letting you jump straight to the end of a file, where the action is.

          "description": "Christy Goldsmith Romero of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will step down on May 31, leaving three seats open at the financial regulator.\nIn a May 16 announcement, Romero said her last day at the agency would be on May 31, ahead of her initial plans to leave if the Senate confirmed former commissioner Brian Quintenz as the new chair. Her departure will come just one day after Commissioner Summer Mersinger is expected to step down to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO.\n‚ÄúIt has been a tremendous honor to conclude my 23 years of federal service at an agency with such an important mission to ensure that financial markets perform their critical role in the US and global economies,‚Äù said Romero.\nRomero and Mersinger‚Äôs upcoming departures would leave the CFTC with only two Senate-confirmed members: acting chair Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson, each taking one Republican and Democratic seat, respectively. The shakeup in leadership gives President Donald Trump the opportunity to pick two more commissioners after the Senate addresses Quintenz‚Äôs nomination.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",
