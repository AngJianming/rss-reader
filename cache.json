          "description": "Triage Meaning in Software\nThe main goal is to ensure that the most critical defects are addressed promptly while deferring or even rejecting low-impact issues that don‚Äôt threaten the product‚Äôs stability or customer satisfaction.\nWhy Do You Need a Defect Triage?\nEfficient Use of Resources: Focus development and testing efforts on defects that truly matter.\nBetter Decision Making: Enables data-driven discussions about whether to fix, defer, or reject a defect.\nImproved Communication: Aligns all stakeholders on defect status and resolution plans.\nQuality Control: Helps maintain a healthy and manageable defect backlog.\nHow Often Should You Have Defect Triage?\nDaily during active development or release cycles.\nThe Defect Triage Meeting\nReview new and existing defects.\nDefect Triage Process\nGather Defects: Collect all open or newly reported defects since the last triage.\nReview & Clarify: Ensure all bugs have complete, understandable, and reproducible steps.\nAssess Severity & Priority: Classify based on business impact and urgency.\nAssign Ownership: Designate responsible developers or teams.\nSet Resolution Plan: Define when and how the bug should be addressed (fix immediately, delay, or reject).\nChallenges with Defect Triaging\nSubjectivity: Different stakeholders may have conflicting views on a bug‚Äôs severity.\nVolume Overload: Too many bugs can overwhelm the team and delay decisions.\nIncomplete Information: Poorly reported bugs slow down the triage process.\nLack of Accountability: Unclear ownership can result in unresolved or orphaned defects.\nTime Constraints: In fast-paced sprints, teams may skip triage, leading to chaos later.\nThumb Rules in Bug Triage\nFix high-severity and high-priority bugs first.\nConclusion\nBy incorporating intelligent platforms like GenQE.ai, teams can elevate their defect triage process with automation, pattern recognition, and smart prioritization, making software testing more efficient and outcomes more predictable.",

Struct layout refers to how fields within a struct are arranged in memory, including any padding that the compiler adds to ensure proper alignment.\nIn Go, the compiler follows specific rules for struct layout to ensure efficient memory access and proper alignment with the underlying hardware architecture. This process is automatic, but understanding it can help you write more memory-efficient code.\nThe way structs are laid out in memory can have significant implications for your application's performance and memory usage.
