Whether you’re building a side project or working in a production environment, writing efficient and readable SQL can save you hours of debugging and optimization.\nIn this post, I’ll share 5 practical tips to help you write smarter SQL—whether you’re using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite.\n1. Be Specific with SELECT\nBad:\nSELECT * FROM users;\nBetter:\nSELECT id, name, email FROM users;\n2.Use Table Aliases for Clarity\nBad:\nSELECT * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\nCleaner:\nSELECT o.id AS order_id, c.name AS customer_name\nGood aliases make your queries easier to scan, especially in team environments or long queries.\n3. Index Strategically\nExample:\nCREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';\n4. Keep It DRY with Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\nInstead of nesting subqueries:\nSELECT name FROM (\nUse a CTE:\nWITH user_counts AS (\n5. Use CASE for Conditional Logic\nSELECT name,\nThis makes your logic explicit without post-processing in application code.\nN/B:\nSQL is simple on the surface, but powerful underneath. The more intentional you are with your queries, the better performance and maintainability you’ll get.",

          "description": "Let’s uncover the layers of testing that silently fuel the world’s most reliable applications:\nTesting isn’t just about discovering defects — it's about ensuring confidence. It verifies business logic, validates user experience, and safeguards against regressions. Good testing builds trust — for both the team and the end-users.\nWaiting until development ends to test is outdated. Modern QA begins during planning, collaborating with developers and analysts to write better stories, define edge cases, and prepare smarter test data.\nAutomation helps with speed, but it’s not a magic wand. Understanding what to automate (and what not to) is key. A balanced strategy combining manual, exploratory, and automated testing leads to optimal results.\nToday’s testers are not just script runners. They’re quality advocates, embedded in agile teams, contributing to design reviews, writing testable requirements, and driving continuous improvement.\nStop counting just test cases and defect counts. Modern teams track defect leakage, test coverage gaps, and test debt — metrics that help assess not just quantity, but the impact and effectiveness of testing.\nSoftware testing isn’t a bottleneck — it’s a business enabler. The faster we test well, the faster we ship with confidence. 🚀",

That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. \nIn this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.\n\nUnderstanding staking\nJeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.\n“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously.

The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.\nUnfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it.
