Think of it like a dance where each participant knows their steps and reacts based on cues from others there’s no single conductor telling everyone what to do.\nIn the context of EDA:\nServices produce and consume events.\n\n\nEach service listens for relevant events and reacts accordingly.\n\n\nThere is no central orchestrator managing the process.\n\n\n\nThis pattern is sometimes also called Broker Topology, a term popularized by Mark Richards in Software Architecture Patterns (O’Reilly).

Moving from PS2/Xbox to the then-new PS3/Xbox 360 meant tooling up from scratch, and Pandemic rightly asked for a full two-year cycle. Talks stalled, the project never got off the ground, and pandemic’s neat space-to-ground combat ideas stayed on the drawing board.\nLucasfilm then handed the reins to Free Radical Design—who got 95% through their own Battlefront 3 before that too was canned—and Pandemic itself folded in 2009. Decades later we’re still waiting on a “true” Battlefront 3, with EA’s 2017 reboot Battlefront II standing in as the closest thing fans have.",

Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.\nInstitutional investors sense a long-term opportunity and, hence, have continued to pump money into Bitcoin exchange-traded p…",

These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.\nThat was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.\nDNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund …",
