          "description": "eKilo - Enhanced Kilo\n\n\nhttps://github.com/antonio-foti/ekilo\neKilo is a lightweight terminal text editor based on the original kilo editor with enhanced functions. Its peculiarity is that it can run on any hardware, maintaining a high-performance and useful style. It installs in a minute, if you want to take a look I would be happy, having found a utility myself, having completely replaced vim. Any advice is highly appreciated. \nSyntax highlighting:\nC/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift, SQL, Rust, Dart\nImproved terminal resizing\nClean screen exit\nAutocompletion\nNo external dependencies\ngit clone https://github.com/antonio-foti/ekilo.git\ncd ekilo\nmake\nsudo cp ekilo /usr/local/bin/\n\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/ekilo\n\nekilo filename.ext\n\nCtrl-S: Save file\nCtrl-Q: Quit (press 3 times for unsaved files)\nCtrl-F: Search\nCtrl-H: Backspace/Delete\nArrows: Navigation\nIf window size is incorrect:\nPress Ctrl-L to refresh\nResize terminal slowly\nUse supported terminals (xterm, gnome-terminal, etc)\nNote: Compilation warnings about string truncation can be safely ignored\nLicense: BSD 3-Clause (based on original kilo license)\nAcknowledgements: Original kilo by Salvatore Sanfilippo (antirez)",

By the end of the article, you should feel confident enough to give it a try in your own applications.\nYou can use PHP 8.4's asymmetric visibility feature to define different visibility levels for the getter and setter of a property.

Spoiler alert: didn‚Äôt work. Now I start every prompt with a single, clear objective. For example, instead of saying:\n‚ÄúI want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco that are lesser-known and offer a cool and unique adventure.‚Äù\nThis part was a game-changer for me. You need to tell the AI how you want the information delivered. For example, I might say:\nAccuracy matters. Especially if you're sharing this info with someone else. That‚Äôs why I also write little reminders like:\n‚ÄúMake sure the name of the trail is correct, that it exists, and that the time is accurate.‚Äù\nThis was the part I used to skip and it‚Äôs where the magic happens. The more personal context you give, the more tailored and human the AI‚Äôs response feels.\nIn my case, I wrote a whole paragraph explaining how my girlfriend and I love hiking, that we‚Äôve done all the major SF trails, and that we‚Äôre craving something new because she‚Äôs leaving for LA soon and we want to make this weekend count.\nI even mentioned how much I love hikes that end with a good breakfast.

This comprehensive guide walks you through building a physics-based AR app that works on both iOS and Android, complete with 3D models, gesture controls, and performance optimization.\nBefore we write a single line of code, watch the short clip embedded below. It shows the final app spawning a 3D robot, reacting to taps, and obeying real-world gravity. The video answers the only question that matters up front: \"Is this worth my time?\" If the result looks like something you want on your phone, read on.\n(If you prefer code first, skip to section 3.)\n\n\n\nDevice family\nRequired OS\nChipset/CPU\nMemory\nAR framework\n\n\n\n\niPhone XR ‚Üí 15 Pro Max\niOS 15 or later\nA12 Bionic or newer\n‚â• 2 GB RAM\nARKit\n\n\nPixel 4 ‚Üí 8 Pro, Samsung S10 ‚Üí S2‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Your English is not where you want it to be, and it has nothing to do with you not knowing the top 5,000 idioms.\nWhen you‚Äôre under pressure, tired, or just hungry, you won‚Äôt be at your best. That goes for your mother tongue as well, but the problems are clearer and more pronounced when speaking English. \nThat‚Äôs because your own language is automatic. You have a feel for what is right. There is no logical thought process or analysis that slows you down. \nFor example, do you ever freeze in English? Forget what it was you were trying to say? Make a mistake with some sort of grammar that theoretically you studied decades ago?\nLanguage in general is a natural, human phenomenon. There are over 300 million people in the US ‚Äì we‚Äôre not all geniuses, but we‚Äôre all pretty damn good at the 2nd condit‚Ä¶",
