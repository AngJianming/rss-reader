          "description": "TL;DR\nApplication Scoped (@ApplicationScoped):\nIntroduction\nThe @ApplicationScoped annotation instructs the CDI container to create a single instance of a bean that is shared throughout the application's entire lifecycle. This reuse offers substantial advantages in terms of reduced memory footprint and minimal object instantiation overhead, thereby enhancing runtime efficiency. However, its shared nature inherently introduces concurrency risks, as the single instance is accessible by multiple threads simultaneously. Consequently, improper handling or misunderstanding of thread-safety principles within these beans can lead to race conditions, inconsistent states, or application-wide errors.\nIn contrast, @RequestScoped beans provide a fresh instance for every individual HTTP request, natural‚Ä¶",
