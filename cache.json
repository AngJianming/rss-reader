Did you forget to declare this file as an output of a script phase or custom build rule which produces it?\n第一次遇到这个问题是在 Xcode 10 升级， Legacy Build System 升级为 Modern Build System 后，因为编译过程并行化，导致在前序的 Build Phase 步骤中下载的文件，无法被后面的步骤检测到。表现出来的错误的情形是：第一次构建时 Xcode 会报错。再按一次 Build 按钮，编译顺利通过。\n在编译项目过程中，我们需要用到一些从服务器下载下来的文件。随着项目变大，需要下载的文件也逐渐变多。没有选择直接放在项目仓库里一是因为这些文件比较大，直接存在 GitHub 上浪费空间，二是因为二进制文件不适合版本管理。因此，我们通过运行一个 Run Script 的 Build Phase 来管理、下载这些文件。在项目每次编译时，首先执行这个步骤，从而确保本地的二进制文件是最新的。\n因此，这个脚本需要从一个项目文件读取一些信息，然后从服务器下载对应的个数不定的文件，而这些文件后面会作为 On-Demand Resources 打包进 app bundle。\nWWDC22: Demystify parallelization in Xcode builds | Apple 介绍了新的现代构建系统通过一些巧妙的办法，最大程度并行化编译过程，以节省时间。不得不说，看了视频里展示类似于火焰图的性能图表，所有构建流程都紧凑地分散在不同的物理核心上时，令…",

Then we claimed our free custom domain using Entri (IONOS) — and just like that, Story Hero was live.\nIt’s:\n🔄 Responsive & mobile-friendly\n💫 Full of subtle animations\n🔍 SEO-optimized with OG metadata\n📬 Equipped with an email waitlist signup\nHonestly, it turned out beautiful and exceeded our expectations — and it’s already helping us tell the Story Hero story to the world.\n\nWe also whipped up our first draft of App Store screenshots. They’re rough, but they’re enough to help us push towards our next big milestone: getting the app submitted for App Store review ASAP.\n\nThe review process can take time (and surprises happen), so our focus is to get a \"good enough\" build live fast, then iterate from there. The sooner we get it into Apple’s hands, the sooner we can get real users and even paying subscribers — all before the hackathon ends.\nThis week’s progress gets us one step closer to the goal: launching a real product with paying users in just 30 days. We’re still going for the “Make More Money” challenge, and every decision is focused on that north star.\nEven if we don’t win a prize, building Story Hero alongside this community is already worth it.

While the human element remains central to this deeply personal area of law, AI is enhancing how attorneys operate—both behind the scenes and at the client-facing level.\nKey Ways AI Is Impacting Estate Planning Attorneys:\nClient Intake and Communication Some firms are using AI chatbots or guided questionnaires to collect initial client information, identify goals, and flag common issues. This reduces administrative work and helps attorneys begin each case with clearer context.\nRisk Detection and Compliance AI tools can now analyze estate documents for errors, inconsistencies, or missing provisions. This adds a layer of quality control and helps attorneys ensure documents align with a client’s objectives and current laws.\nEducational Tools and Client Empowerment AI-driven platforms can also help clients understand complex concepts like probate, trust funding, or tax exposure—making the attorney’s job easier and consultations more productive.\nAI isn’t replacing estate planning attorneys—it’s refining their role. By automating routine tasks, attorneys can focus on personalized strategies, complex family dynamics, and providing the human guidance that clients still deeply value.\nCreated By: Dalton Breshears",
