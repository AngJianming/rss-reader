          "description": "This is a submission for the Bright Data AI Web Access Hackathon\nI created Travel Genie — an AI-powered agent designed to help tourists plan smarter and cut down trip costs effortlessly.\nTravel Genie identifies cost-saving opportunities by fetching real-time flight and hotel data, calculates total expenses based on trip duration, and converts it all into the user’s local currency. It then scrapes real-time sentiment and trending activities from across the web to generate a personalized itinerary, presented as a calendar that seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar, Spplr, and other apps.\nManual planning can be tedious and often leads to overspending. Travel Genie automates the process, delivering smart, data-driven travel itineraries in minutes.\nThe demo GIF highlights the core features…",

          "description": "When our engineering team first introduced AI into the code review process, the reactions ranged from cautious optimism to outright skepticism.\n“Can it really catch bugs like a senior engineer?”\n“Isn’t this just glorified linting?”\n“Do we really need another tool in the pipeline?”\n\nThree months later, not only had those doubts vanished, but AI had quietly become the most consistent, fastest, and least opinionated reviewer on our team.\nHere’s how it happened — and why I think most dev teams will eventually go the same route.\n\n🧩 The Problem: Review Bottlenecks Were Slowing Us Down\nThey were the bottleneck. Reviews would sit for hours — sometimes days — waiting for someone with the time, context, and energy to give thoughtful feedback.\nWhen reviews did happen, they were inconsistent. Some engineers nitpicked naming. Others dove into logic. Some skipped reviews entirely under deadline pressure.\nIt was messy, and it was costing us.\n[\n\n\n](https://rkoots.github.io/?utm=devto_img)\n💡 The Turning Point: Automating the First Pass\nSo we piloted two tools:\nCodeball: An AI PR reviewer that instantly analyzes changes and flags potential issues.\nSuddenly, something clicked.\n🚀 The Transformation\n✅ PRs Got Instant Reviews\n\n🧠 The Feedback Was Legit\nUnsafe null checks\n🧑‍💻 Engineers Became More Productive\nArchitecture\n📊 The Results: What Changed in 90 Days\nCode review time dropped by 68%\nOur team trusted the process more. PRs no longer felt like a chore. They felt like collaboration.\n\n🧪 Bonus: We Built a GPT Reviewer\nIt:\nPulls in PR diff context\nIt doesn’t replace our senior devs — it amplifies them. It’s the junior engineer who never sleeps, never argues, and always gives you something useful to think about.\n🔄 A New Default\nIt’s become our new default:\nAI first. Human final. Better together.\n🧭 Final Thoughts\nThe tools we used weren’t complex. You can try them today:\nCodeball \nAnd if you're curious how to build your own GPT-powered reviewer, I’ll be sharing the blueprint at rkoots.github.io.",

If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.\nIt can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.\nThat same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.\nAmazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connec…",

The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.\nWallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.\nPower like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …",

Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. \nJason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the …",
