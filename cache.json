          "description": "What if AI didn’t just chat—but actually opened your browser, wrote your report, designed your logo, and sent the email… all by itself?\n\nThat’s the bold promise of Manus AI—and I had to try it.\nI recently discovered Manus, an ambitious autonomous AI agent launched in March 2025. Unlike typical bots that only chat, Manus can plan and execute multi-step tasks: it reads websites, writes code, simulates environments, designs visuals, and more—all without constant supervision (manusai.io, en.wikipedia.org).\nTool‑calling & independent execution: Manus interacts with a browser, CLI, files, and even image-generators—finishing tasks end‑to‑end, not just sketching solutions (manusai.io).\nState‑of‑the‑art GAIA benchmark results: It reportedly surpasses models like OpenAI DeepResearch—humans score ~92%, GPT‑4 plugins ~15%, and Manus reportedly hits ~86–90% (manusai.io).\nIntegrated visuals: It can generate images (e.g. logos, mockups) within context-based workflows—like branding a food truck—rather than serving one-off art (techradar.com).\n\nOpinions are mixed:\nPraise: “The most impressive AI tool I’ve ever tried… could eliminate the need for coding as we know it” (businessinsider.com).\nCritiques: Users report slowness, task failures, and that credit costs can add up quickly .\nManus is still invite‑only. A waitlist is active, but invites are rare (reuters.com).\n➡️ If you've ever wanted AI that actually does things—plans, executes, integrates visuals—without babysitting, Manus is worth exploring.\nif you use my invite link, we both get credits to get started faster:\n🎁 Want to try Manus AI for free?\n\nUse my invite link and we’ll both get credits to explore its full power:\n\n👉👉 https://manus.im/invitation/Y28BAHOA6WTI 👈👈\n\n\n\nStrengths\nWeaknesses\n\n\n\n\nFull task planning & execution\nSlow & sometimes unstable\n\n\nIntegrated visuals & docs\nCredit‑heavy & warranty limits\n\n\nOutperforms standard agents\nPrivacy & invite constraints\n\n\n\nbusinessinsider.com\ntechradar.com\nbusinessinsider.com",
