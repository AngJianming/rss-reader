The fsync and fdatasync system calls are often used to provide this guarantee to the user that data has been safely flushed to the storage device. The user can then be certain that in any case of power failure they would not lose their data. \nHowever, these calls are not cheap. An application would block while waiting for the system calls to return. Napkin math latency numbers puts it at around 1ms. I did a test for fsync system call on my laptop just to compare whether I'd get the same latency values. The bpftrace script I used looks like this\n\nBEGIN\n{\n    printf(\"Tracing fsync latency...

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors ‚Äî subsequently fired ‚Äî ‚Äúabused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.‚Äù\n‚ÄúWe have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement‚Äôs pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,‚Äù said Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough ‚Äúno passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed‚Äù according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.\nCoinbase‚Äôs stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported ‚Äúverified user‚Äù numbers.
