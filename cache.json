The first feature is a whole new  text console that enables you to control and connect the two player characters between time. And the second is a map on the UI enabling you to better understand you position in the game. \nhttps://aproulx232.github.io/pompeii-time-out/\nhttps://github.com/aproulx232/pompeii-time-out\nI used Amazon Q as a visual studio code extension. I have had extensive professional experience with other AI coding tools such as Cursor and Cline. Amazon Q was extremely easy to install and get up and running with the context I already have around AI tools. I found I used the chat feature the most, the same way I would use Cursor chat.

We'll explain the underlying mechanisms of Go's type system and how the language handles such comparisons without raising errors or panics.\nUnderstanding Go's Type System\nGo is a statically typed language, which means that the types of all variables are known at compile time. When you define a variable, its type must be explicitly declared or inferred, leading to a robust type safety framework. However, Go introduces a unique feature with the any type, which can hold a value of any type. This flexibility plays a crucial role in our example.\nThe Role of the any Type\nIn your provided code, we see the variable hello is declared ‚Ä¶",

As you check the MCP spec, you‚Äôll quickly come across some RFCs:\nOAuth 2.1 IETF DRAFT\nOAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata (RFC8414)\nOAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol (RFC7591)\nNot familiar with these? You‚Äôre not alone. Even OAuth 2.0 is widely adopted, understanding and implementing it correctly still takes time. MCP is built on solid foundations with these standards, so the best approach is to follow the spec. That‚Äôs exactly where MCP Auth comes in.\nThe good news: you don't have to do it from scratch.\nWe are introducing MCP Auth: everything you need to add production-ready auth to your MCP server.\nMCP Auth offers a set of tools and tutorials to help you implement auth for MCP servers. It helps you integrate with any RFC-compliant OAuth 2.1 / OIDC provider using just a few lines of code:\n\nVisit mcp-auth.dev to get started.\nOur first release includes SDKs for Python and Node.js, tested with providers like Logto and Keycloak.\nNot sure if your provider is compliant? Try our provider test tool to find out.\nWe‚Äôre working on adding more SDKs, more tutorials, and better support for different providers. If you have questions or ideas, feel free to start a discussion.\nHappy building!",
