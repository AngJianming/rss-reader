The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024.\nE*Trade homepage. Source: E*Trade\nThis would not be Morgan Stanley‚Äôs first exposure to digital assets. The bank‚Äôs wealthiest clients have had access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and futures for some time, with the firm‚Äôs advisers allowed to pitch Bitcoin ETFs since August 2024.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley to explore crypto offerings for clients ‚Äî CEO\nRegulatory tailwinds push crypto forward\nThe news follows previous reports that Morgan Stanley was considering adding cryptocurrency trading to its E*Trade online brokerage platform in early January. The reports at the time cited the expectations of a friendlier crypto regulatory environment.\nThe move comes amid an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the United States following the election of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a pro-crypto platform and is personally involved in several blockchain ventures.  \nRelated: Morgan Stanley discloses $188M in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings\nThe first 30 days of the Trump administration brought significant changes to the local crypto industry. More recently, US crypto proponents have shown optimism following the swearing-in of pro-crypto Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins.\nThe SEC had significantly changed its stance even before Atkins took office. In late February, the agency had already paused multiple cryptocurrency enforcement cases with imminent deadlines.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.\nMagazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin ‚Äî BitcoinOS and Starknet",
