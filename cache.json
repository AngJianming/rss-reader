          "description": "Welcome to the next exciting step in \"JavaScript Deep Dive\"! Previously, we mastered managing tasks with arrays and objects. Now, let's introduce user interactions through functions and event listeners, enabling dynamic task addition directly through user input. But to do that we need to learn couple of interesting javascript concepts.\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help reduce repetition and improve readability by breaking complex operations into steps, also making code easier to debug and maintain.\nFunction Declaration:\nThese are the most common type of functions. They are defined using the function keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body.\n\n\n\n\nfunction addTask(taskName) {\n  if (!taskName) return; // Early e‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Real-time systems are those that must adhere to strict timing constraints, ensuring tasks complete their operations within predetermined deadlines. In domains such as automotive control, industrial automation, robotics, and aerospace, microcontrollers often operate under these real-time requirements. When engineers design software for these constrained environments, many issues surface that do not commonly arise in desktop-level or cloud-computing applications. One particularly critical challenge revolves around dynamic memory allocation.  \nDynamic memory allocation involves requesting memory from a central resource (the heap) at runtime, rather than at compile time. In a desktop environment, this process might be handled by a sophisticated operating system or runtime library with mechanis‚Ä¶",

          "description": "State management in React has evolved dramatically. Gone are the days when Redux was your only choice for complex applications. Today's atomic state management libraries offer fine-grained reactivity, minimal boilerplate, and better performance. But which one should you choose?\nTraditional state management forces entire components to re-render when any part of the state changes. Atomic state management flips this approach - only components subscribed to specific pieces of state update when those pieces change.\nThis granular approach offers several key benefits:\nPerformance: Eliminates unnecessary re-renders\nSimplicity: No complex provider trees or reducer boilerplate\nScalability: Independent state atoms that don't interfere with each other\nDeveloper Experience: Intuitive APIs that feel nat‚Ä¶",

          "description": "In this project, I built a basic static file server using Node.js. The server listens on port 3000 and serves HTML, CSS, JS, and PNG files from the project directory. It uses Node's built-in http, fs, and path modules to handle requests and serve files with the correct MIME types. If a requested file is not found, the server responds with a custom 404 message.\nThis project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand how to serve static files with Node.js without any external frameworks. The main purpose of this project is to teach and to demonstrate the capabilities of nodeJS.\nCheck out the code on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/aayush130405/Node-static-server.git",
