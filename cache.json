These characters, represented as \\r and \\n, are used to signify the end of a line and to separate headers from the content in HTTP responses. \nWhen a web application fails to properly sanitize user inputs, attackers exploit this loophole by injecting CRLF characters, misleading the server into thinking a new header or response has started.

It’s such a calm and natural way to wake up—no loud noises, no stress.\nThis tiny automation has made a huge difference in how I start my day.

The fake announcement, which shook markets in the roughly 24 hours before the regulator actually approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, led to the arrest of Council.\n“This case deserves a guideli…",

This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.\nThe 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue.
