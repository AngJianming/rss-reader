          "description": "A while ago I wrote about building a minimal ELF64 parser from scratch — mostly because I didn’t want to bring libelf or GPL into a tiny tool. That post explored the motivation behind the project and the early steps of parsing ELF headers by hand.\nNow, that project — libMiniELF — has reached version 1.0.0.\nlibMiniELF is a lightweight C++17 library for reading ELF64 files. It provides:\nParsing of ELF headers, section headers, and symbols\nAddress-to-symbol resolution (exact and nearest match)\nA small CLI tool dump_elf for inspection\nMIT license, zero dependencies\nThe goal isn’t to replicate the full power of libelf, but to provide a clean and embeddable core for system-level tools, profilers, and static analysis utilities.\nI needed a fast, dependency-free way to:\nExtract symbol names from binaries\nMap instruction pointers to function names\nWalk ELF structures for tooling purposes\nMost existing solutions were either too heavy, too tied to GPL, or over-engineered for what I needed. So I wrote my own.\nFully working CLI interface: dump_elf <binary> with multiple subcommands\nAccurate symbol parsing, including main and nearest resolution\nSection offset lookup with binary search\nClean and tested C++17 API\nVersioned releases starting with 1.0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What’s next\n\n\n\nDWARF support in a separate library (libTinyDWARF)\nStack snapshot + function name resolution\nIntegration with real-time visualization tools\nMore examples and documentation\nGitHub: trianmon/libMiniELF\nIf you're working on binary inspection, trace tools, or just like lean C++ code — feedback is welcome!",

Whether it's weather data, payment processing, or social media interactions, APIs help us exchange data quickly and securely.\nBut with great power comes great responsibility.\nTo ensure fair use and prevent abuse, API rate limiting is crucial. In this blog, we'll break down what API rate limiting is, why it's important, and how to implement common strategies like Token Bucket and Leaky Bucket in Python.\nRate limiting controls how many requests a client can make to an API in a given time frame.\nExample:\n\"You can make 60 requests per minute.\"\n\"No more than 1000 requests per day.\"\nWhy use it?\nProtects APIs from abuse and DDoS attacks\n\nHelps maintain performance and uptime\n\nEnsures fair usage…",
