Whether you're flying solo or collaborating on a team, Git and GitHub help you keep your code safe, traceable, and easy to manage.\nsudo dnf update -y\nsudo dnf install git -y\n\n\nHead to GitHub, create a free account (if you haven‚Äôt), and start a new repository ‚Äî this is where your code will live in the cloud.\n\nüí° A GitHub repository is like a magic folder that tracks every change in your project.\ngit init\n\n\nmaster branch.\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n\ngit add . stages your files, and git commit saves the snapshot. Think of it as telling Git, ‚ÄúHey, these are the changes I care about.‚Äù\nFirst, copy the HTTPS URL from your GitHub repo. Then:\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git\ngit branch -M master\ngit push -u origin master\n\nOops! Git might ask for your username and password, but GitHub no longer accepts passwords.\nGo to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer Settings ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens.\n\nGenerate a token with repo access and copy it. Use it when Git asks for a password.\n\nüîê A GitHub token is a secure key that acts like a password for Git operations.\nI updated index.jsp, then ran:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Updated homepage\"\ngit push\n\nAnd just like that‚Äîmy changes appeared live in the GitHub repo. Magic!\nServices used: EC2, Git, GitHub, VS Code\n\nConcepts learned: version control, repo setup, staging/commits, GitHub tokens\nThis project took me around 2 hours. The trickiest part? Setting up GitHub authentication.\n\nThe best part? Watching my code go live in my repo with one command.\nThis is just the beginning. Stay tuned for Project 3 tomorrow‚ÄîCI/CD, here we come! üí•",
