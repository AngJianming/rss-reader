Analyze and understand the codebase from three key perspectives:\n\n- Software Architect ‚Äì Focus on system design, architecture patterns, and scalability.\n\n- Software Developer ‚Äì Examine code structure, implementation details, and maintainability.\n\n- Product Manager ‚Äì Evaluate features, usability, user flows, and alignment with business goals. \n\nAfter your analysis, compile all findings into a comprehensive README.md or OVERVIEW.md file placed at the root of the repository. This document must:\n\n- Be written in Markdown.\n- Include Mermaid diagrams to explain system architecture, workflows, or processes.\n- Be clearly structured and easy to navigate.\n- Provide actionable insights or questions that could guide further development or refinement.",

I'm really appreciate and proud of it. It means my efforts have been noticed and have not been in vain. \nIf you still don't understand what I'm talking about, check this out. ;) I tried to make timepicker as much close as possible to material spec.
