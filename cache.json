I had the chance to speak at two conferences (FinOpsX 2025 and HAProxyConf 2025) in the same week, and I finally met someone I‚Äôve admired for years. These experiences opened my eyes to how much we can learn when stepping outside the usual environment and talking to people from different backgrounds, industries, and stages of their careers. \n\nAt both events, I found myself surrounded by people with different stories and perspectives. Some were just starting out, others were industry veterans, and everyone had something unique to share. Listening to their experiences made me realize how valuable it is to look beyond and see what‚Äôs happening in the wider world. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in daily work, but when we zoom out, we can find new ideas and inspi‚Ä¶",

In this post, we‚Äôll explore three essential concepts:\nwhile loop\nmap() function\narrow functions (=>)\nLet‚Äôs break them down with simple examples.\nwhile Loop\n\n\nA while loop runs as long as a certain condition is true. It‚Äôs useful when you don‚Äôt know exactly how many times the loop should run.\nwhile (condition) {\n  // code to run\n}\n\nlet i = 0;\nwhile (i < 5) {\n  console.log(\"Number:\", i);\n  i++;\n}\n\nThe loop checks if i < 5\n\nIf true, it runs the code inside\ni++ increases i by 1 each time\nWhen i hits 5, the loop stops\nmap() Function\n\n\nThe map() function is used to transform each item in an array and return a new array with the results.\nlet newArray = oldArray.map(callbackFunction);\n\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nlet doubled = numbers.map(function(num) {\n  return num * 2;\n});\n\nconsole.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]\n\nArrow functions are a shorter way to write functions. They‚Äôre especially useful with methods like map().\nconst functionName = (parameters) => {\n  // function body\n};\n\nHere‚Äôs the same map() example with an arrow function:\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3];\nlet doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);\n\nconsole.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]\n\nüìù If there‚Äôs only one parameter and one expression, you can skip the parentheses and curly braces.\nLet‚Äôs say you want to double the numbers in an array using a while loop and arrow functions.\nlet numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nlet doubled = [];\n\nlet i = 0;\nwhile (i < numbers.length) {\n  doubled.push((num => num * 2)(numbers[i]));\n  i++;\n}\n\nconsole.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]",
