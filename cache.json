It’s as though we forgot about all our best practices.\nIn 2015, cloud spend was projected to grow from $49B to $67B by 2018. In 2023?

Components were passing props six levels deep, and emitting events that would get lost in the hierarchy. I remember thinking, \"There has to be a better way.\"\nThat's when I discovered Vuex. It felt like finding an oasis in the desert. But as time passed and my projects grew more complex, I started to feel the pain points. The boilerplate code, the mutations that seemed redundant, the TypeScript support that always felt a bit bolted on rather than built-in.\nThen came Pinia, and it was like a breath of fresh air.

Here’s my take:  \nAI Won’t Replace Programmers—But It Will Change the Job.\n-AI is a tool, not a replacement. Just like calculators didn’t replace mathematicians, AI (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Devin) will automate parts of coding (boilerplate, debugging, docs) but can’t:\n1 Understand complex business needs or ambiguous human requirements.\n2 Design creative architectures or novel solutions.\n3 Make ethical/critical decisions (e.g., privacy, security, trade-offs).\n\n\n\nProgramming is more than writing code. It’s problem-solving, collaboration, and adapting to chaos—things AI struggles with.  \nThe “Junior Dev” Role Might Shrink\n\nAI can already:\n\n\nGenerate simple code snippets.\n\nFix common bugs.\n\nAnswer Stack Overflow-style questions.\n\n\n\n\nEntry-level tasks may get automated, forcing new programmers to upskill faster (e.g., focus on system design, domain expertise).  \n\n\nFuture Programmers Will Look Different\n\n\nShift from “writing code” to “orchestrating AI.” Example prompts:  \n“Design a scalable API for X, optimize for cost, and explain trade-offs.”\n\n\n\n\nMore emphasis on:\nSoft skills (stakeholder communication, UX empathy).\n\nDomain knowledge (healthcare, finance, etc.).\n\nAI-augmented workflows (prompt engineering, validation).\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Parallels\n\n\nFear: “High-level languages will kill coding!” → Instead, demand exploded.  \n\n\nFear: “No-code tools will replace devs!” → They just enabled non-devs.  \n\n\nAI will likely create new roles we can’t yet imagine. \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Bottom Line\n\n\n\nWorst-case: Low-end coding jobs decline; programmers need to adapt.\n\nBest-case: AI removes grunt work, letting devs focus on harder, more meaningful problems.\n\nMy advice: Learn to leverage AI, but double down on uniquely human skills (creativity, critical thinking, leadership).\n\n\n\nWhat’s your take?
