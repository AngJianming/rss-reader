          "description": "The common perception of trading often revolves around technical analysis, algorithms, and advanced strategies. While these components are essential, they only represent part of the picture. Trading, particularly in competitive environments, also demands psychological resilience and emotional control.\nThis becomes particularly evident in trading tournaments, where pressure, time limits, and direct competition create a behavioral environment that tests more than just market knowledge. Success in such scenarios is not determined solely by the depth of one's strategy, but by the ability to execute under stress.\nIn trading competitions, participants aren't just battling the market—they're also contending with one another. Public leaderboards, predefined timelines, and fixed capital allocations…",

          "description": "TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a versatile image format known for its high-quality and lossless compression. It is often widely used across various devices and platforms, particularly in professional photography, publishing, and graphic design.\nConverting a lot of TIFF images to JPG can significantly reduce file size, making them easier to store and share without compromising too much on quality.\nIn this article, I’ll guide you through the process of using Java to convert TIFF files to JPG format with JDeli, ensuring your images are accessible.  JDeli is the best enterprise-level Java image library for quick development.\nDownload the JDeli trial jar.\nProcess image if needed (scale, sharpen, lighten, watermark, etc)\nWrite out BufferedImage as JPG image file\n\n\n\n\nBufferedImage bufferedImage = JDeli.read(new File(\"tiffImageFile.tiff\"));\n// Read TIFF image into Java\n\nbufferedImage = operations.apply(BufferedImage bufferedImage);\n// Process TIFF image (Optional)\n\nJDeli.write(bufferedImage, \"jpg\", new File(\"jpgImageFile.jpg\"));\n// Write out BufferedImage as JPEG image file\n\nWith the JDeli.convert() method you can save TIFF as JPG in just one line of code.\nJDeli.convert(File inFile, File outFile);\n\nJDeli.convert(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream, \"jpg\");\n\nbyte[] outputData = JDeli.convert(byte[] inputData, \"jpg\");\n\nYou can specify an EncoderOptions object with this option to configure output settings like image compression.\nJDeli.convert(File inFile, EncoderOptions outputOptions, File outfile);\n\nCommand line or bash, bat, and PowerShell scripts can be used to mass convert TIFF to JPG. This method also allows JDeli to be invoked from any programming language that supports creating a child process.\njava -jar jdeli.jar –convert jpg \"inputFileOrDir\" \"outputDir\"\n\nIn this tutorial you learned how to bulk convert TIFF to JPG in bulk, our Java Image library JDeli also has TIFF support for reading and writing, which you can learn more about on our support site.",

Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.\n\nDid you know?
