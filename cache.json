So the system recognises that the script contains shell commands that will be executed.\nThe .sh extension in a script stands for \"shell script.\" It's a convention commonly used for scripts written for Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS) that are intended to be executed by a shell (such as Bash or Zsh). The extension indicates that the file contains shell commands, but it's not mandatory for the script to work. It's mainly used for organization and clarity.\n\nBasic While Loop Script\nCreate the script in Vim.\n\nIf we do a ls ‚Äìltrh we see the script has been created.\n\nIf we do not give the right permissions to execute the script, then we will get denied.\n\nIn Linux, we give execute permissions to users in order to run a script.\nThere are three categories of users who can be given permissions:\nOutput:\n\nTo run a script on Linux, you typically need to give it execute permissions. This can be done using the chmod command.\nOpen your terminal.\nNavigate to the directory where the script is located.\nRun the following command to give the script execute permissions:\nchmod +x script_name.sh\nOR\nchmod 755 (name of the script)\n\n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn\n\n#CloudEngineer #SysAdmin #ITSecurity #TechTips #BusinessIT #Leadership",
