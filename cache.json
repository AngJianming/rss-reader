LLM or similarly large multi-modal models, when given separate tools to interact with its environment (aka agency) as per its own reasoning, are often termed as AI agents. \nMore formally,\n“An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfil tasks.”\nAI agents are sum of two main components: the brain (an AI model), and the body (its capabilities and tools).

Car rental businesses are now leveraging AI and machine learning to transform core functions such as fleet management, pricing, and customer engagement.\nSo, how does this work technically?\nBy integrating telematics and AI-driven anomaly detection systems, rental companies can predict vehicle servicing needs. This reduces downtime and ensures optimal fleet availability. Tools like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn can be used to train models on historical maintenance and mileage data.\nUsing AI models trained on demand signals, weather, seasonality, and competitor data, rental companies can implement dynamic pricing strategies similar to airlines. Frameworks such as PyTorch or XGBoost help in building real-time pricing models.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) tools like Dialogflow or Rasa are deployed for customer support and bookings. Integrating them with CRM systems offers a unified, seamless experience for users.\nTime series forecasting using models like Prophet (by Facebook) or LSTM networks is empowering companies to anticipate demand fluctuations and position vehicles accordingly across locations.\nIf you’re a developer, architect, or CTO thinking about AI integration, check out our detailed breakdown of how AI is changing the car rental game—from strategy to stack.\n👉 Read full article here: AI in Car Rental: A Roadmap to Business Transformation.",
