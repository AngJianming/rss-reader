Given this recent affiliation, I’ve been digging into API tools again. You know, checking what works, what is painful, etc. And I want your take as well.\nAPI specs and docs are critical for public-facing microservices, and some internal ones may need them even more. They’re a mess to manage. Currently, we have sources of truth scattered everywhere, specs drifting from code, docs living in another tool, you have some dashboards that nobody checks, and overall, governance is pure chaos.\nMost tools don’t help:\nCloud sync…",

Ask AI.\nNeed test cases? Let AI write the first draft.\nConfused by an error? Let it explain.\nBut always double-check. AI makes stuff up sometimes (you prob already seen that).\nWant to stay ahead? Get really good at:\nProblem-solving\nCommunication\nSystem design\nProduct thinking\nThese are things AI can’t fake.\nYou don’t need to be faster than AI.\nYou just need to be smarter, more thoughtful, and more human.\nLet AI do the boring stuff.

In the React Native universe, those APIs aren't pleasant extras—they're what drive real-time experiences, infinite scrolls, one-tap checkouts, and instant push updates. If an API call is slow or fails, the entire user experience is slow, glitchy, and unreliable.\nThat's why gaining mastery of React Native API integration is mission‑essential if you need to deliver high‑performing mobile apps that scale elegantly as your user base grows.

It might look like this:\na1b2c3d HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from feature-x to main\nd4e5f6g HEAD@{1}: commit: Add new login functionality\n...\n\n👉 Look for the last commit hash (e.g., d4e5f6g) from the deleted branch.\nOnce you’ve identified the right commit, you can bring the branch back with:\ngit checkout -b your-branch-name <commit-hash>\n\nExample:\ngit checkout -b feature-x d4e5f6g\n\nBoom 💥 — your branch is back!\nGit eventually garbage collects old commits, so try to restore the branch as soon as possible to avoid permanent loss.\n\n\n\nAction\nCommand\n\n\n\n\nView Git reflog\ngit reflog\n\n\nRestore branch\ngit checkout -b branch-name <commit-hash>\n\n\n\nBy keeping this trick in your Git toolbox, you’ll never fear accidental branch deletions again.

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”\n“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data.
