          "description": "In TypeScript, there are cases where you want to define a type that ensures an object contains at least one specific property, while allowing any additional properties.\nA common example is ensuring an object has a name property, regardless of what else it contains.\nTo specify that an object must have at least a name property:\ninterface HasName {\n  name: string;\n}\n\nfunction greet(obj: HasName) {\n  console.log(`Hello, ${obj.name}`);\n}\n\ngreet({ name: \"Alice\", age: 30 }); // ‚úÖ Works\n\nInstead of declaring a separate interface:\nfunction greet(obj: { name: string }) {\n  console.log(`Hi, ${obj.name}`);\n}\n\nThis also works fine for inline use.\nIf you're working with generics and want to retain the full object type while requiring a name property:\nfunction greet<T extends { name: string }>(obj: T) {\n  console.log(`Hi, ${obj.name}`);\n}\n\nThis keeps the full shape of the passed object available for further use.\nSometimes you receive unknown data and want to ensure it has a name property:\nfunction hasName(obj: any): obj is { name: string } {\n  return typeof obj === 'object' && obj !== null && 'name' in obj;\n}\n\nUsed like:\nconst data = { name: \"Bob\", age: 40 };\n\nif (hasName(data)) {\n  console.log(data.name); // Safe access\n}\n\nTo enforce the presence of a property like name:\n‚úÖ Use a basic interface like { name: string }\n\n‚úÖ Use generics for flexibility and type retention\n‚úÖ Use type predicates for runtime checks\nüîê TypeScript won't automatically enforce \"only one property\", but it ensures required keys exist\nThis pattern is useful in APIs, forms, and anywhere you want to enforce structure while still allowing flexibility.",

Every HTML element becomes a node in this tree.\nWhen your browser loads a web page, it parses the HTML and builds the DOM from it. JavaScript can then interact with this DOM to read, change, add, or remove elements from the page ‚Äî in real time!\nüìå DOM is not the HTML itself ‚Äî it's a live representation of it in memory.\nLet‚Äôs say you have this HTML:\n\nhtml\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    <p>This is a paragraph</p>\n  </body>\n</html>",

My application used webpack-dev-middleware to compile a massive monolithic project with thousands of modules.
