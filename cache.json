Its friendly compiler not only infers types automatically but also provides helpful error messages that guide you toward writing sound code. In this post, we'll explore practical examples that highlight how Elm‚Äôs type inference and compiler feedback enhance code correctness and simplify your development experience.\nWhen coding in Elm, the compiler deduces the types of values based on their usage. This lets you focus on application logic rather than on managing repetitive type declarations.\nConsider a simple arithmetic function:\nsquare x =\n    x * x\n\nSince the multiplication operator (*) applies only to numbers, Elm infers that x must be a number.

Surprisingly, many skills from my medical background translate directly into programming.\nHere are 5 lessons from neurology that shape how I now think about software engineering:\nIn medicine, we never treat a symptom without understanding its root cause. Debugging works the same way ‚Äî don‚Äôt guess. Investigate.\nAnalyzing EEGs or MRIs is about spotting patterns. Writing efficient code or identifying logical bugs requires the same cognitive muscle.\nWhether prescribing medication or defining logic in code, tiny errors can lead to serious consequences. Precision builds trust ‚Äî in both healthcare and software.\nMedical professionals live by notes. In code, comments, READMEs, and clear commit messages keep everything healthy and maintainable.\nIn both medicine and tech, decisions have real consequences. Transparent, explainable algorithms are just as vital as informed consent.\nI‚Äôm currently learning Python, full-stack engineering, and bioinformatics with the goal of contributing to healthcare-focused AI solutions.\nLet‚Äôs build a world where medical insight and machine logic support ‚Äî not replace ‚Äî human care.\n‚Äî\n\nAlireza Minagar, MD, MBA, MS\n\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/alirezaminagar\n\nMedium: medium.com/@aminagar_38889",
