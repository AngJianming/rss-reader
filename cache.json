          "description": "Key takeaways: \n\nTraders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. \n\nOn-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. \n\nBitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. \nA bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues. \nBTC/USDT 1-day chart.
