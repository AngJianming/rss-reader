          "description": "Introduction to Pattern Programs in Python\n\n\nPattern programs in Python are simple exercises where we print shapes, symbols, or numbers in a certain layout using loops. These are great for beginners because they help build logic and strengthen your understanding of Python’s basics—especially loops and the print() function.\nLet’s learn step-by-step, starting with easy shapes and gradually moving to more interesting ones.\nWhat You Should Know First\n\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you’re familiar with:\nBasic Python syntax (how Python code is written)\nLoops — especially for loops and while loops\nIf you’ve heard of these, you’re good to go!\nWhat is a Pattern Program?\n\n\nA pattern program is a small script that displays a certain design or shape—like stars, numbers, or letters—on the screen.\nFor exa…",

Think Meta Ray-Bans, but with Apple’s ecosystem glue and rumored Siri smarts baked right in.\nThe author’s wish list for Apple’s specs: way deeper Siri integration and personal context (imagine a mini AI you actually know), higher-quality cameras (no more soft, over-processed clips) and intelligent notification management that syncs with your Focus modes. Those three tweaks could make Apple’s glasses the must-have accessory for iPhone fans.",

          "description": "Hello guys and welcome to my devblog where I've been documenting my journey as I develop my ambitious package manager called \"deadlock\" and today was again a frustrating day for me as I had to install the zlib library to the project and just like always, it didn't build in the first time. If you've been following this series, you'd know that installing a library in C++ is as hard as a wooden stick. It won't build until I RECONFIGURE THE WHOLE SH*T FROM GROUND UP.\nAnyways, after the reconfigure, I saw some weird decisions I had made throughout the whole process like why did I use FetchContent to download the libraries on the fly when I had already put them in my source folder. I could've just included the subdirectory at the build time.\nAt this point I realised a basic rule of programming:\nand then I ignored all of it and went ahead to read the documentation of zlib. I am currently reading this and I hope it is at least half if not as completely easy as the JSON one.\nThat's all for today guys, will catch you tomorrow when I bring updates about this library.\nTill then Bye 🫡",
