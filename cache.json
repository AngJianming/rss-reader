          "description": "Epic Games just sweetened the deal for developers: starting June 2025, the Epic Games Store will take 0% on the first \\$1 million in annual revenue per game, then revert to its usual 12% cut on anything above that. That’s a huge shift from rivals like Apple (15%+) and even Steam’s tiered 30/25/20% model, so smaller titles can keep every penny until they hit that million-dollar mark.\nOn top of that, Epic’s rolling out “Webshops” hosted right in the store—letting devs send players to make purchases outside the app and dodge Apple/Google’s hefty fees. Players even earn a 5% Epic Rewards bonus on webshop buys. All this follows a landmark US ruling forcing Apple to allow alternate payment options, and it comes as the Epic Store’s user base swells (295 million PC players last year, up 25 million).",

The suit, filed May 2 in California, accuses Genki of trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair competition for making it look as if their products were licensed or approved and misleading fans about “day one” compatibility.\nBehind the scenes, Nintendo claims Genki either faked access to confidential hardware specs or tricked consumers into thinking they had inside info, all while tapping Nintendo’s “Switch” and “Joy-Con” marks without permission. Even after Nintendo publicly pointed out the mockups were unofficial, Genki doubled down—prompting Nintendo to sue to protect its brand, clear up fan confusion and seek damages for potential harm to its reputation.",
