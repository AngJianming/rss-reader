          "description": "TypeScript - sounds familiar to another coding language called JavaScript, right? Well, it's a language based on JavaScript; the only difference is that it focuses on type safety. This makes it easier to catch errors before you run your code. This makes working on big projects easier to manage and improves the coding process by making it smoother and more reliable. Luckily, it's not too hard to learn as long as you have a basic understanding of JavaScript. JavaScript was created by Microsoft and released in October 2012\nHow do I start?\nnpm install typescript --save-dev\nnpm install @types/node --save-dev\nnpm install ts-node --save-dev\n\nWhen you declare a variable, you need to declare the value type.

As you can see, the code lines in block 1 should execute in order. The code lines in block 2 should also execute line by line. But blocks 1 and 2 have no dependency on each other.

It inspired me to extract and adapt it for use in our own business systems.\nThanks to DolphinScheduler’s open-source nature, this component can now be conveniently reused with minimal overhead. Let’s walk through how to extract it and run a working demo.\nFirst, we define a base interface for all events:\npublic interface IEvent {\n}\n\nTo support delayed execution, we introduce an abstract class AbstractDelayEvent that exte…",

          "description": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.\n“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",

Source: US Senate\nThe GENIUS Act was introduced on Feb. 4 by US Senator Bill Hagerty and seeks to regulate the nearly $250 billion stablecoin market — currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC).\nThe bill requires stablecoins be fully backed, have regular security audits and approval from federal or state regulators. Only licensed entities can issue stablecoins, while algorithmic stablecoins are restricted.\nSeveral Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill on May 8, blocking a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s crypto ventures and anti-money laundering provisions.\nRelated: Circle plans IPO but talks with Ripple, Coinbase could lead to sale: Report\nThe bill was revised soon after to receive enough bipartisan support to proceed to a vote.\nHagerty’s stablecoin bill builds on the discussion draft he submitted for former Representative Patrick McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act in October.\nMagazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”\n“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.\nCoinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.
