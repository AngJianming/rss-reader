These helpers make your code cleaner and more efficient.\nBut there's a common issue, defining the same function more than once will cause a Fatal error..\nWhat's the problem?\nIf the same function is declared twice, PHP will throw an error like this:\nFatal error: Cannot redeclare function_name()\nThis often happens because of:\nRepeated includes:\n\n\nPackage conflicts:\n\n\n\nThe safe solution\nTo prevent this issue, wrap your helper functions like this:\nif (!function_exists('sayHello')) {\n    function sayHello() {\n        return 'Hello!';\n    }\n}\n\nThis way, if the function already exists, PHP will skip redefining it, and your app will keep running smoothly.\nIn Laravel projects\nEven with Laravel‚Äôs powerful autoloading and service container, this pattern is essential.
