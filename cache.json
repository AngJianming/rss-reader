The issue was not security-related but was severely impacting application performance and availability.\nInitial Investigation\nSymptoms: CloudWatch alarms were triggered for high CPU utilization. Users reported slow response times, and the instance occasionally failed AWS status checks.\nBaseline Check: I reviewed historical CloudWatch metrics and observed that CPU usage was previously stable, with occasional spikes, but now it was consistently maxing out during business hours‚Ä¶",

You can automate outreach without sounding like a robot‚Äîand without losing that personal touch.\nHere‚Äôs a straightforward approach:\nKeep your contacts in a spreadsheet with key info like name, email, website, and any notes you have about them (like their interests or recent projects). This makes personalization easier.\nTools like Lemlist, Mailshake, or others allow you to automate emails while customizing key details like the recipient‚Äôs name or recent blog posts. This means your emails still feel personal even when sent at scale.\nStart your email by mentioning something specific about the person‚Äîlike a recent article they wrote, their product launch, or something relevant to their work. This small touch makes a big difference.\nSet up a few polite follow-up emails to send if you don‚Äôt get a response, but make sure your system stops if they reply. No one likes getting spammed.\nKeep an eye on your open and reply rates. Test different subject lines and messages to see what works best.\nIf you‚Äôre comfortable with scripting, you can build simple automations that pull contact info from spreadsheets, generate personalized intros using AI tools, and send emails‚Äîall while maintaining control over the process.",
