You can totally build that habit.\nClean code means writing code that's clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?\nHere’s the truth:\nThere’s never a perfect time to refactor\nMessy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.\nWriting clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it.

Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.\nSo why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.\nSo it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let's talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:\nThe characteristics of inheritance and composition\nWh…",
