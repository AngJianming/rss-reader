          "description": "When you install or run Python-based tools on Arch Linux — especially from the AUR — you might notice that your system accumulates a lot of __pycache__ directories. These are generated when Python byte-compiles modules, but they aren’t always removed when you uninstall a package.\nIn this short guide, we’ll walk through how to identify and optionally clean up those __pycache__ directories — specifically the ones not owned by any package — and exclude system paths like Flatpak while we're at it.\nTools installed via the AUR (like waydroid-scripts-git, for example) might drop files under /opt, /usr/local, or other places. These files (especially .py and __pycache__) might not be tracked by pacman, so even after uninstalling the tool, leftover Python cache directories can remain.\n__pycache__ Directories\n\n\nHere’s a one-liner that will:\nSearch your system for all __pycache__ directories\nSkip the Flatpak directory (/var/lib/flatpak)\nCheck whether each is owned by any package\nPrint only the ones that are not owned\n\n\n\n\nfind / -type d -name '__pycache__' -not -path '/var/lib/flatpak/*' 2>/dev/null | while read dir; do\n  pacman -Qo \"$dir\" &>/dev/null || echo \"Not owned: $dir\"\ndone\n\nNot owned: /opt/waydroid-scripts/tools/__pycache__\nNot owned: /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/some_tool/__pycache__\n\n__pycache__ directories aren't dangerous, but they can accumulate and clutter your system — especially in directories that aren’t cleaned by package managers. With a few commands, you can find and clean up these leftovers safely, keeping your system neat and under control.\nHave your own cleanup tricks? Share them in the comments!",

Whether you're hosting a small web app or a full-scale enterprise platform, you don’t want to be manually adjusting resources every time traffic spikes. That’s where Azure’s autoscaling steps in. \nAutoscaling means your application can automatically increase or decrease resources based on demand. Instead of overprovisioning (and overpaying) or dealing with performance issues during traffic spikes, you set rules that let Azure do the scaling for you. \nAzure supports autoscaling for several services: \nApp Services \nVirtual Machine Scale Sets \nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) \nAzure Functions \nIn this guide, we’ll focus on App Service autoscaling, since it’s one o…",
