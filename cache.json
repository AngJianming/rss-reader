Suddenly, a botnet floods your /login endpoint with thousands of fake login requests per second.\nWithout this new feature:\nYou would’ve had to analyze logs, manually create WAF rules, and deploy mitigations — usually too late.\nWith this new update:\n✅ WAF automatically:\nDetects the traffic anomaly\nApplies CAPTCHA challenges or blocks malicious requests\nKeeps your service stable and available\nBaseline Learning: WAF observes your traffic and learns normal behavior patterns.\nDetection: If something spikes — like login abuse, slow POSTs, or odd User-Agents — it gets flagged.\nMitigation: WAF applies auto-generated rules to block or challenge the traffic instantly.\nAll of this happens without any manual configuration — although you can still customize responses.\nThis protection works with:\n🌐 Amazon CloudFront\n⚖️ Application Load Balancer (ALB)\n🚪 API Gateway, App Runner, AWS Cognito, and more\n✅ Zero config to get started (just enable the managed rule group)\n🧠 ML-based detection means smarter responses\n⏱️ Near-instant protection = less downtime\n💼 Ideal for SREs and Cloud Security Engineers who need peace of mind\nAWS WAF now detects and blocks Layer 7 DDoS attacks automatically using machine learning — with zero disruption, no manual effort, and instant response. 🎯\n💬 Are you already using AWS WAF in production?

This means you can seamlessly switch between EC2 and Fargate, or even balance across both — all without service disruption.\nBefore this update:\nYou had to recreate your ECS service to switch capacity providers.\nThat meant: reconfiguring load balancers, updating pipelines, and risking downtime.\nNow:\nSimply use the UpdateService API or AWS Console to switch providers.\nZero service recreation. Zero downtime.\nSay your ECS service web-api-service is currently running on EC2.\nYou now want to shift to Fargate to reduce infra management.\nYou can run this:\naws ecs update-service \\\n  --cluster my-cluster \\\n  --service web-api-service \\\n  --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1\n\n\n➡️ Done! Your service will begin replacing EC2 tasks with Fargate tasks smoothly.\nYou can also mix both:\n--capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1 capacityProvider=EC2,weight=1\n\n\nThis splits traffic 50/50 between EC2 and Fargate.\n🟦 EC2 Auto Scaling groups\n🟩 AWS Fargate\n🔁 Mixed strategies\n🧰 AWS Console or CLI\nOld Way: Recreate service to switch compute backend (risky & manual)\nNew Way: Just update the capacity provider — smooth, fast, and safe ✅\nAre you planning to migrate your ECS services to Fargate?\nOr do you use both compute types for cost control?\nLet me know in the comments! 👇",
