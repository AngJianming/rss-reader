          "description": "1. Introduction\nVisual quality inspection is a critical process in many industrial settings, from manufacturing assembly lines to agricultural sorting. Traditionally, these inspections have relied on manual human effort or fixed rule-based machine vision systems. However, with increasing product complexity and the demand for higher throughput, these approaches often fall short in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability. This is where machine learning (ML) offers a transformative solution, enabling automated, intelligent defect detection.\nWhile cloud-based ML inference is powerful, many industrial applications necessitate \"edge inference.\" This means deploying ML models directly onto devices located close to the data source ‚Äì on the factory floor, in remote facilities, or on autono‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Microsoft 365 F1 is tailored for frontline workers who need secure, streamlined access to essential tools without the complexity of full desktop applications. While the plan supports core communication and collaboration features like Teams and Outlook (web/mobile only), it offers limited capabilities when it comes to scripting and automation. Users on the F1 plan do not have access to full desktop versions of Office apps, which restricts the use of advanced scripting tools like VBA macros in Excel or Word.\nUsers on Microsoft 365 F1 can access Power Automate, but only at a basic level. This means they can create simple workflows using standard connectors‚Äîsuch as automating approval requests or notifications via Microsoft Teams. However, premium connectors and advanced process automation are not available under this plan. Organizations that require more complex automation across apps and services will need to consider a higher-tier license to unlock those features.\nWhile end-users face scripting restrictions, IT administrators managing Microsoft 365 F1 environments do have access to some administrative scripting capabilities via PowerShell. This allows them to automate user provisioning, license management, and certain security configurations. However, these tasks are limited to what‚Äôs permissible within the F1 license scope and do not extend scripting capabilities to the end-users themselves.\nIf your business requires users to run scripts, develop custom solutions, or build automated workflows across multiple services, Microsoft 365 F1 may not be sufficient. Plans such as Microsoft 365 Business Standard, E3, or E5 offer full desktop apps, broader access to Power Automate, Microsoft Graph API, and more advanced scripting environments. Upgrading to one of these tiers ensures your team has the flexibility and tools needed for deeper customization and process automation.",

Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nSource: John Karony\nKarony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform‚Äôs creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly ‚Äúdiverted and misappropriated millions of dollars‚Äô worth‚Äù of SafeMoon‚Äôs SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.\nRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraud\n\nLatest in a line of crypto execs facing criminal charges\nAt the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.\nKarony‚Äôs trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict. \nMagazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",

Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.
