We‚Äôve just released v0.1.695, now in Beta, focused on making Razen leaner, more reliable, and developer-friendly ‚Äî especially when it comes to error handling and library support.\nRazen is still early-stage but rapidly evolving. The Beta status means:\nThe core syntax and libraries are mostly stable, ready for serious exploration\nWe‚Äôre actively gathering community feedback to shape future features\nSome APIs and tokens are still in flux (like the recent token removals), aiming for a clean, maintainable language\nIf you like being on the cutting edge, diving into language ‚Ä¶",

Rate limiting defines a specific number of requests allowed within a given time window, while throttling adjusts the rate dynamically based on system load.\nPrerequisites:\nImplementing rate limiting and throttling requires careful consideration of:\nRequest identification:  Unique identifiers (IP addresses, API keys) are needed to track request rates.\nTime window: Defining the appropriate timeframe (e.g., per second, minute, hour) for counting requests.\nLimit enforcement: Choosing a mechani‚Ä¶",
