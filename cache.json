And too often, the answer is: it depends.\nBut it wasn’t always like this.\nIn the early days of blockchain development, we ran our own full nodes. Ethereum, BNB, Solana—whatever chain we needed, we spun up geth, parity, or solana-validator on a cloud VM, paid by the hour, and hoped for the best.\nThe model was straightforward: provision compute, pay for uptime.\nScaling, though, was manual and brittle.

A common scenario developers encounter is determining when a <RepeatButton> is released after its click events are triggered. Given that the <RepeatButton> class in WPF generates a sequence of Click events while it's held down, it can be challenging to recognize when the button is no longer pressed. In this article, we'll explore the best way to handle this situation using C# and WPF.\nWhy Use RepeatButton?\nThe <RepeatButton> control is a useful UI element in WPF applications, especially for scenarios that require continuous input, like volume controls or media player controls.

I also practiced how to implement these tags correctly.\nTo apply what I learned, I created a simple project — a Resume Web Page — using only HTML and CSS.\nHTML5 – for creating the structure of the web page\nCSS3 – for styling and layout design\nThe project was a basic version of a personal resume. Here’s what I included:\nHeader with my name and title\nAbout Me section\nSkills section (listed using bullet points)\nEducation and Experience sections using proper semantic tags like <section>, <article>, and <aside>\n\n\nContact Information with basic links and icons\nThe goal was to focus on layout, structure, and clean design — all using plain HTML and CSS.\nLearned new HTML tags and their real-world use\nPracticed writing clean, semantic HTML\nUnderstood how to apply basic CSS for styling and layout\nGained confidence by completing a mini-project\nNext, I plan to:\nAdd more styling using CSS Flexbox or Grid\n\nMake the resume mobile-responsive\n\nTry adding a bit of JavaScript for interactivity in future versions",

It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.\nAnd yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2.

It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.\nLaunched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. \nWhen a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …",

          "description": "Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. \nWith over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.\n“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states. \n“This will allow World Liberty Financial to validate the technical functionality of its airdrop system in a live environmen…",
