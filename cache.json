          "description": "C++ can be brutal, End of Post lmfao.\n\n\nSeriously though, I used to wait hours (sometimes days ) to ask my peers, thinking it would be embarrassing to ask stupid questions that I should've known by now.\nNow I learned that in some cases, a 2-minute conversation can save you 6 hours of frustration.\nBetween memory management, templates, and cryptic compiler errors, getting stuck is practically guaranteed in life just like taxes & death. But if you’re learning C++ like me (or using it in school/work), one of your most powerful tools isn’t your compiler…\n…it’s knowing HOW to ask effectively.\nI'll share a few simple strategies that make it easier to get the help you. For example, here's a bad question.\n\"My code doesn’t work. Can someone help?\"\nHelpful answers? Not likely. You’ll probably get one of the following:\n“Post the full code.”\n“What are you trying to do?”\n“What error are you getting?”\nVery vague and commenters are unaware of your end goal making unnecessary challenges for them. Here's some alternatives that gets way better results. \nExplain the goal, not just the nature of your error.\nExplain your approach or code so far.\nIf all else fails, paste or use the snippet tool\nNote: It also helps to mention the compiler and version so helpers have an idea of what your workspace.\nTo conclude, Learning C++ is hard enough. Don’t make it harder by suffering in silence or posting vague question. Cheers!",

          "description": "The definition of association in SQL is overly simplistic: association is essentially performing a Cartesian product of two tables and then filtering the result, expressed in syntax like A JOIN B ON .... Python’s approach to association largely follows the SQL approach, with similar concepts and methods.\nHowever, esProc SPL understands association differently, with a definition that is no longer related to the Cartesian product.\nSPL divides association into two categories. One is called foreign key association, which refers to the association between a regular field (foreign key) of one table and the primary key of the other.\nFor example, the foreign keys employee_id and customer_id of the orders table are associated with the primary keys of the customers and employees tables, respectively…",

          "description": "US President Donald Trump supports the BITCOIN Act and has a team of experts in the White House working to roll out landmark digital asset legislation in the coming weeks, according to Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis. \nSpeaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.”\nIn March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. \nAs Cointelegraph reported, the Trump administration has reiterated the need to use “budget-neutra…",
