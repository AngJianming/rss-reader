          "description": "Everyone’s talking about Supabase, Vercel, Firebase, Replit, and similar services as the go-to stack to launch SaaS apps fast.\nI tried them.\nThey’re sleek and easy to use. But once I started estimating real-world costs for my project, I realized they add up fast, and that’s a problem when you're launching without real users yet.\nSo I built my SaaS, Odichat, with a different approach — one that costs me $45/month and gives me full control, solid performance, and zero vendor lock-in.\nLet me break it down.\nHere’s what I’m running:\nA production-ready Rails 8 app\nA staging environment for safe deployments\nFile storage for user uploads\nTransactional emails\nBackground job processing\nWebsockets\nCaching\nAnd all of this for $45/month.\nHere’s the exact monthly breakdown:\nHetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49\nHetzner shared vCPU (remote builder): $4.99\n(used for asset precompilation and deploys)\nHetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99\nDigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33\nZoho Mail (support email inbox): $1\nPostmark (transactional emails): $15\nTotal: $45.80 USD/month\nI’m using SQLite3 as the database.\nYep, SQLite in production.\nIt’s free, and for my current load it works perfectly. I haven’t had a single issue that justifies migrating to PostgreSQL (yet).\nRails 8 ships with the “Solid” suite:\nSolid Queue (background jobs)\nSolid Cache\nSolid Cable (Websockets)\nIt’s a full-featured solution without extra setup or Redis requirements. And it performs great.\nBecause I want:\nPredictable, low costs\nZero surprises from usage-based pricing\nInfra I understand and can control\nThe ability to grow into higher traffic without switching stacks\nI’m not anti-serverless. But at this stage, this is the simplest and most sustainable setup I’ve found.\nIt’s not “trendy”.\nIt’s not “modern”.\nBut it works AMAZINGLY well, it’s cheap, and it lets me focus on building, not budgeting.\nIf you’re building a SaaS and want full control without overpaying early on, I highly recommend exploring this kind of setup — especially if you’re using Rails.",
