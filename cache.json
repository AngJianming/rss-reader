          "description": "A few months ago, we launched collab.dev: a public, open-source platform that analyzes how open source projects actually collaborate. This week, it was DevHunt's Tool of the Week.\nThis is the story of how it went from a hackathon prototype to a living resource used by hundreds of developers and maintainers - and what we learned about measuring what truly matters.\nAt PullFlow, we build tools that help developers work better together - through GitHub, Slack, and VS Code integrations. But over time, we kept running into the same question:\n\"How do we measure collaboration in the first place?\"\nDORA metrics are the closest thing the industry has. But they focus on deployment speed - not whether teams were actually working well together. Meanwhile, teams could feel when collaboration was broken (…",

HTTP/1.0, HTTP/2.0, and WebSocket each support modern web applications in different scenarios. This article will implement the core logic of these three protocols using pure Python sockets to gain an in-depth understanding of their underlying communication principles. All example code in this article has been verified in a Python 3.8+ environment, covering core technologies such as network programming, protocol parsing, and byte stream processing.\nHTTP/1.0 is an early stateless request-response protocol based on TCP connections.

PWAs provide native-like experiences to your users on supporting devices.\n\n\nIn short you can build an APP at once and can be used in any platforms (mac, linux, windows, Android, ios). Also no need to worry about publishing fee (It's completely free).\n\n\nNext.js : For both frontend + Backend. It can be use for full-stack development.
