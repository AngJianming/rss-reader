          "description": "Hey everyone! \nThis is my very first blog post, and I‚Äôm super excited to share my journey into web development with you. I recently joined an offline class to learn HTML and CSS ‚Äî the foundation of every website ‚Äî and today was Day 1 of this new adventure. \nWhat is HTML & CSS?\nBefore diving into the details, here's a quick intro for those who are new:\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web. Think of it as the skeleton of a web page ‚Äî it defines headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.\n\n\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style that content. It adds color, spacing, layout, and makes your site look beautiful.\n\n\n\nWe started by learning some essential HTML tags that help structure a web page:\nHere‚Äôs a sample structure I created for a portfolio websi‚Ä¶",

I love the idea of creating things people can actually see and use. My goal is to become a UI/UX developer, so front-end is my first step towards that dream.\nIn the First week of course, I got introduced to the core building blocks of the web:\n*HTML (HyperText Markup Language): *\n<h1>, <p>, <a>, <div>, etc.\n*CSS (Cascading Style Sheet): *\n*Basic layout techniques: *\nThese really helped me understand better:\nPractice the code by using pen and paper.\nReading my running notes often.\nWrite blogs what I actually leaned each day.\nNext week, I'll be diving deeper into:\nCreating a small project.\nUse Linux OS often for better understanding about Open-source.\nStart something new can feel overwhelming, especially in tech. But this first week showed me that ''Consistency is the key to Success''. Each day i learn something new, I'm one step closer to my goal.\nThanks for reading!\nFeel free to connect with me or drop your tips for beginners in the comments.",

The map shows every single leaf, twig, and blade of grass, overwhelming you with detail and making it impossible to find your way. This is similar to the challenge faced when working with high-dimensional data ‚Äì datasets with numerous variables or features. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction is like creating a clearer, more manageable map, highlighting only the essential landmarks to guide you efficiently. It's a powerful technique in machine learning that simplifies complex data without losing crucial information.\nThis article will explore the fascinating world of unsupervised dimensionality reduction, explaining its core concepts, applications, and challenges in a clear and accessible way.\nUnderstanding the ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Why\n\n\nI'm a lazy person. I've never done zip compression for responses to clients (although I've used encryption to reduce content size before sending). When someone recommended that I should zip and send it back to clients, it raised the question: \"Hey, is what we've been using all along (HTTP compression) better? Or is manual zip better?\". This project was born to compare data transmission between HTTP compression and manual ZIP response.\nThis project will be divided into 3 main parts:\nCompression Server: Uses Express with compression middleware to send data compressed with gzip\nManual ZIP Server: Uses Express with middleware to create ZIP files with the returned data\nClient: Calls both APIs and compares data transmission sizes. It will test both HTTP compression and manual ZIP. For HTTP‚Ä¶",
