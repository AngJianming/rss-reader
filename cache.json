In 2023, 80% of API breaches were tied to weak authentication, costing companies millions. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are the modern shield for your APIs, offering a secure, scalable way to protect user data and ensure trust. Whether you're a beginner crafting your first REST API or a seasoned architect securing enterprise microservices, mastering JWTs is essential for building reliable, hack-resistant applications.\nJWTs are compact, cryptographically signed tokens that verify user identity and secure data exchanges.
