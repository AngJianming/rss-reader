          "description": "Today, I learned about CSS Transforms, and I‚Äôm excited to share what I discovered!\nThe transform property in CSS lets you visually manipulate elements ‚Äî you can move, rotate, scale, and skew them without changing the actual layout. It's super useful for animations, hover effects, and modern UI design.\nHere are some common 2D transform functions:\ntranslate(x, y)\n\n\nMoves an element from its original position.\ntransform: translate(50px, 100px);\n\nrotate(angle)\n\n\nRotates an element clockwise.\ntransform: rotate(45deg);\n\nscale(x, y)\n\n\nScales an element in the X and Y directions.\ntransform: scale(1.5, 1.5);\n\nskew(x-angle, y-angle)\n\n\nSkews the element.\ntransform: skew(20deg, 10deg);\n\n3D transforms add depth to your elements and make them appear to move in 3D space. To view them properly, you often need to use the perspective property on the parent container.\nrotateX(angle)\n\n\nRotates the element around the X-axis.\ntransform: rotateX(45deg);\n\nrotateY(angle)\n\n\nRotates the element around the Y-axis.\ntransform: rotateY(45deg);\n\nrotateZ(angle)\n\n\nRotates the element around the Z-axis (similar to 2D rotate).\ntransform: rotateZ(45deg);\n\ntranslateZ(distance)\n\n\nMoves the element closer or farther away in 3D space.\ntransform: translateZ(50px);\n\nperspective(n)\n\n\nDefines the distance between the viewer and the 3D element.\n.parent {\n  perspective: 500px;\n}\n\n<style>\n.box {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background: teal;\n  transition: transform 0.3s;\n}\n\n.box:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.2) rotate(10deg);\n}\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"box\"></div>\n\nWhen you hover over the box, it grows and rotates ‚Äî all thanks to the transform property!\nCSS transforms (2D and 3D) are powerful tools that add creativity and interaction to your web designs. I enjoyed experimenting with different effects and seeing how elements can move and rotate on screen.\nNext, I‚Äôm planning to learn about CSS animations and how they work with transforms.",
