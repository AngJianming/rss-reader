          "description": "Figma: The Collaborative Powerhouse for UI/UX Design Teams\nFigma is still the top dog when it comes to design platforms that let teams work together easily. It's all cloud-based, which is a big deal. Unlike old-school desktop apps, Figma lives right in your browser. That means no more sending files back and forth or getting confused about which version is the latest. It's changed how UI/UX teams get things done.\nWhy Professional UI/UX Designers Choose Figma in 2025\nDesigners are really into Figma because it's a one-stop shop for everything design-related. They've got some cool new stuff in 2025, like Figma's AI-driven tool called First Draft. It uses AI to make design drafts based on your basic ideas.
