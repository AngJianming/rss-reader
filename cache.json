Whether you’re crafting a dynamic form or building reusable components, knowing how to manage events efficiently can make your code simpler, more readable, and more performant.\nToday, we’ll break down a deceptively simple difference that many React devs gloss over:\nonChange={handleChange}\n\nvs\nonChange={(e) => handleChange(e)}\n\nAt first glance, both seem to do the same thing—pass the event to a handler.

Now, we’re stepping into our next phase: onboarding web projects from Canadian small businesses and non-profits that are willing to fund development costs while supporting community learning.\nIn the last month, we have onboarded four scrum masters and project mangers. Now we are looking for two UI/UX designers to join our team! If you're interested, please send us a message on our website - www.webdevpath.co. Be sure to include your LinkedIn profile and a short introduction so we can schedule a meeting with you!\nWe have started planning to migrate our website from JavaScript to TypeScript. This will happen in stages:\nUpgrade all packages\n\n\nThis includes upgrading Next.js to version 15, React to v19, and we will also have to upgrade Node.js version on Netlify. \nSetup Typescript Support\n\n\nFollowing the Typescript Migration Guide, we will set up the project in a way that it supports both TypeScript and JavaScript files during the transition phase. All new pages and components will be made with typescript while we gradually migrate old JavaScript files to TypeScript.\nWe have completed the migration to styled-components on our website in 2023. Recently, styled-components announced that they are entering maintenance mode. We had a discussion as to whether we have to move away from styled-components. \nWe believe it might be something we eventually need to do, but there is no immediate need to move away from it. In the next few months, we will investigate alternatives to styled-components, and develop a strategy for the migration.",

Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nSource: John Karony\nKarony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.\nRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraud\n\nLatest in a line of crypto execs facing criminal charges\nAt the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.\nKarony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict. \nMagazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",
