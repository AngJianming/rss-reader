And why should you, as an engineer or architect, care?\nLet’s break it down.\nImagine you're comparing two vectors (think: dense representations of text, images, or code snippets). Cosine similarity doesn’t care about how long each vector is. Instead, it focuses on how aligned they are.\nIn math-speak:\nCosine similarity = cos(θ) between two vectors A and B\nIf they point in the same direction → score is 1 (perfect match).\n\nIf they’re at 90° → score is 0 (totally unrelated).\n\nIf they’re opposite → score is -1 (contradictory).\nSo, cosine simila…",
