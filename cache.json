This is particularly the case if you wish to utilize a specific font that Bootstrap overrides with its own default settings. Let’s explore how to effectively resolve font conflicts by overriding Bootstrap typography with your custom selection.\nUnderstanding Font Conflicts with Bootstrap\nBootstrap provides a robust grid system, components, and utilities that simplify web development. However, one downside of relying on Bootstrap is that it comes with predefined typography styles that might not align with your design goals.
