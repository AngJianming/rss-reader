          "description": "In an era where digital experiences shape business outcomes, one quality determines your long-term survival more than anything else Resilience.\nYour infrastructure could be bulletproof. Your application could be cloud-native. But can your system handle unpredictable traffic spikes, cascading failures, or regional outages? That’s where resilience testing steps in.\nWhat Is Resilience Testing?\nResilience testing evaluates how a system behaves under failure conditions. It doesn’t just ask “Does it work?” but “What happens when it breaks?”\nIt simulates:\nServer failures\nNetwork slowdowns\nDependency crashes\nPower outages\nAnd ensures your system recovers gracefully.\nWhy Is It Important?\nModern architectures rely on distributed systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure. These are fast and scalable but also more complex and interdependent.\nEven a single point of failure like a downed DNS server can lead to hours of downtime. Resilience testing identifies weak links before your users do.\nReal-World Example\nStartups, banks, hospitals all rely on resilient systems to ensure uptime, customer trust, and compliance.\nWhat Should You Test?\nA complete resilience testing strategy includes:\nInfrastructure failure: What if an availability zone goes down?\nApplication failure: What if a microservice crashes?\nNetwork instability: Can services handle latency?\nResource exhaustion: How does your system behave under stress?\nBest Practices\nIntroduce failures gradually.\nMonitor everything latency, error rates, recovery times.\nUse automated tools like Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.\nAlways run post-mortems to fix root causes.\nWhat It Means for You\nIf you're investing in uptime, user experience, and SLA commitments, this should be on your radar.\nWant to learn how Signiance helps teams implement resilience testing at scale?\nthe full blog",

          "description": "Let’s say you have a service that, in response to some event, performs a series of operations that can’t be wrapped into an atomic transaction. For example, this service might integrate with an accounting system and, in response to a sale event, create an invoice (Step 1) and send that invoice to a customer (Step 2). If either of these two steps fails, the entire sale event processing should be retried. However, if Step 1 succeeds, but emailing the invoice fails, we obviously should retry only the email step and not create a duplicate invoice.\nThe idea is simple: persist the status of each processing step (e.g. invoice creation and emailing) in a database, and during a retry, resume from the failed step.\nThese statuses will be fetched from the database using an ID derived from the received…",
