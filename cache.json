          "description": "Understanding JavaScript's Memory Leak Patterns\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Introduction\n\n\nJavaScript, as a programming language designed for building interactive web applications, has evolved significantly since its inception in the mid-1990s. The increasing complexity of modern applications and their dependence on dynamic content have led to a pressing need for developers to understand not only how to write efficient code but also how to manage memory effectively. One of the most pernicious issues that can arise in long-running JavaScript applications is the memory leak, which can lead to decreased performance and application crashes. \nIn this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the patterns, causes, and solutions regarding memory leaks in JavaScript. We will cover historical contexts, in-depth code …",

          "description": "What is a parallel public chain?\nThe transaction execution of traditional smart contract platforms (such as Ethereum) is serial: one transaction can be executed only after the next one is executed, and even if the transactions do not affect each other, they cannot be processed in parallel. This leads to a very low throughput (TPS). Ethereum has an average of only a dozen TPS, and transaction congestion and gas fees soar during peak hours. Parallel public chains are different. They analyze the dependencies between each transaction and execute independent transactions on multiple computing cores at the same time. In layman’s terms, it is to make the blockchain multi-channel parallel operation like an assembly line, split the tasks into small pieces and process them in parallel, which can gre…",

          "description": "This turned out to be a pretty cool concept. While working on my site monitoring app, I had around three or four services like uptime checks, DNS lookups, pinging, and a few others. Since I’m not much of a UI designer, I ended up creating separate files for each service, even though they all shared the same layout.\nThat’s when I discovered Flask’s template inheritance. Instead of repeating the same code over and over, you can create a base layout and reuse it wherever you want. It really helped clean things up and made everything way easier to manage. Here’s how you can set it up.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <title>template-inheritance</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <header>\n        <nav>\n            <ul>\n                <a href=\"home\">home</a>\n                <a href=\"about\">about</a>\n                <a href=\"contact\">contact</a>\n            </ul>\n        </nav>\n    </header>\n    <main>\n        {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n    </main>\n    <footer>\n        &copy; 2025 My Site\n    </footer>\n</body>\n</html>\n\nSimply put, if you want to use the same template like reusing the same navigation bar across multiple pages, you can just extend the base file. The whole layout gets reused automatically.\nAnd if you want to change something specific on a page, you define blocks in the base file that let you override those sections whenever you need to. For example, if you want to override content inside the  tag, you would define a block like this in the base:\n <main>\n      {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n </main> \n\nThen, in your child template, you extend the base and override that block:\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n<div class=\"content\">\n    hello world!!\n</div>\n{% endblock %}\n\n\nThat way, you get the shared layout and can customize parts of the page without repeating your code.",

          "description": "The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.\nIn this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.\n\nAs of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…",

But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.\nThe most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend.

However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.\nTo address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network.
