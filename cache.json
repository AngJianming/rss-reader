          "description": "The static hiss of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, once a symbol of anxious waiting and complex diagnostics, is increasingly overlaid with the hum of sophisticated algorithms. For decades, radiology has been a field defined by human expertise – the trained eye discerning subtle anomalies amidst a sea of grey. Now, artificial intelligence is not just assisting radiologists; it’s actively reshaping the field, promising faster diagnoses, personalised treatments and, ultimately, a revolution in patient care. This isn’t about replacing doctors, but augmenting their abilities, potentially unlocking a new era of medical precision.\nRadiology, uniquely positioned, was ripe for an AI takeover. Unlike many areas of medicine relying on subjective patient histories and complex physiological…",

Today, let's talk about the timer in Cangjie's language development. This part is really interesting.\nWhy do I say so? Because you can hardly find any documentation about Cangjie's timer, nor are there any related code prompts. It can be said that it just keeps writing without a word.\nHowever, it was still found by You LAN Jun with some clues. Today, I'll share it with everyone.\nCangjie's Timer is hidden in the std.sync package and is called Timer. However, when using it, importing only the Timer package is not enough. We need to import these modules:\nimport std.time.*\nimport std.sync.Timer\nimport std.sync.CatchupStyle\n\nThe writing method of the timer is also …",

Hope it inspires someone else working on a similar idea.\nThanks for reading!",
