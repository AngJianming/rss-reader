          "description": "Web3 is no longer in the experimental phase. It's a functional, multi-billion-dollar infrastructure layer powering new forms of finance, coordination, and computation.\nAs a developer working in or adjacent to this space, the question isn’t just what’s interesting—it’s what’s working?\nThis article distills recent research from Solus Group and Simplicity Group, aligning technical implementation with business performance. If you’re building in Web3, here’s what matters under the hood.\nIn traditional SaaS, you assess LTV, CAC, churn, and ARR. In Web3, the mechanics are different—but the rigor should be the same.\nHere are the core metrics every developer should be aware of when evaluating or building a protocol:\nTotal Revenue\n\nThe most reliable signal of product-market fit.

One particularly common hurdle for users leveraging bolt.new is the \"project too large\" error. This error indicates that the AI's context window—the amount of code it can process—has been exceeded, hindering its ability to provide intelligent assistance. This post will dive deep into why this error occurs and, more importantly, provide a clear, actionable solution: effectively utilizing the .bolt/ignore file.\nWhen bolt.new tells you your project is too large, it's not necessarily complaining about the number of lines of code you've written.

          "description": "Managing last-mile delivery can be tricky — especially when routes change, delays happen, or drivers get off track. But with the right tools, you can simplify the process, cut down costs, and improve customer satisfaction. That’s where Delivery Routing for NetSuite comes in.\nPlanning routes by hand takes time and often leads to errors. With NetSuite’s delivery routing, routes are created automatically using key factors like distance, time windows, traffic, and delivery priority.\nNetSuite’s delivery solution includes real-time GPS tracking, which gives you a live view of where your drivers are.\nThings don’t always go as planned. Deliveries get canceled or traffic jams pop up. NetSuite allows you to re-route deliveries on the go based on real-time conditions.\nDrivers can use a mobile device to collect signatures, photos, or notes when they drop off an order. This info syncs directly to NetSuite — no paperwork, no delays.\nAll your delivery activity — routes, driver stats, customer feedback — is tracked in one place inside NetSuite. This makes it easy to see what’s working and what needs improvement.\nIf you rely on delivery as part of your business, optimizing the last mile isn’t optional — it’s necessary. With NetSuite’s Delivery Routing, you get more than just route planning. You get a tool that brings visibility, speed, and control to your entire delivery process.\nExplore our SuiteApp →\nSiva Krishna is a Digital Marketing Executive at NetScore Technologies, a leading provider of SuiteApps for NetSuite users.
