In this edition, we‚Äôre peering behind the curtains of OpenAI ‚Äî a company that promises artificial general intelligence for humanity, but sometimes feels like it‚Äôs run by a secret society of prompt wizards and billionaire whisperers.\nIf Steve Jobs had a baby with a TED Talk, you'd get Sam Altman. Charismatic, visionary, unnervingly calm ‚Äî and mildly obsessed with controlling the future of intelligence. Sam doesn‚Äôt just want to build AI. He wants to build the last technology humanity ever needs to invent.\nHe pitched GPT-2 as dangerous to release, made GPT-3 a demo darling, and launched ChatGPT into virality ‚Äî all while preaching alignment, safety, and a future where AIs are our overlords' therapists.\nWhat drives Sam?\n\nNot eyeballs.

The weight of expectations can feel crushing, leading to burnout and self-doubt.  The Bhagavad Gita, through the dialogue between Arjun and Krishna, offers a powerful antidote to this modern struggle.\nThe central teaching, \"You have the right to your actions, but never to their results,\" challenges our outcome-obsessed culture. We often measure our worth by external metrics ‚Äì likes, promotions, financial success. When these metrics fall short, we internalize the failure, blaming ourselves instead of the system.\nThe Gita proposes a radical shift in perspective: focusing on effort, not just results.
