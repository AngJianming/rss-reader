          "description": "Introduction\nWriting large data sets to a file can become a challenge when you're dealing with iterators in Rust, specifically when the base type is u8. You might wonder about the best practices for writing these iterators efficiently without collecting them into a large vector first. Let’s explore the problem and discover an effective approach.\nUnderstanding the Problem\nWhen you have an iterator with a large length in Rust, collecting it into a vector can lead to high memory consumption and inefficiency. Ideally, you want to write data to a file directly from the iterator stream. This minimizes memory usage and allows for processed data to be written efficiently in chunks.\nEfficiently Writing to a File with BufWriter\nUsing a BufWriter can help buffer the output to a file, which generally …",

Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.\n\nDid you know?
