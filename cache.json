The issue is I'm always a bit lazy to edit videos of my dev journey, so I never got around to creating them.\nInstead, an idea has been circulating my mind for a while: what if dev logs were partially automated? I won't answer this question fully for now, but I'll take a stab at it with a first submission to the hackathon.\nAs I'm building with Bolt, I've started with a prompt:\n\nBefore putting it into Bolt, though, I want to refine the prompt.

          "description": "CppCon 2024 was my first in-person conference ‚Äî and it ended up being one of the most meaningful experiences in my career so far.\nI didn‚Äôt just attend: I volunteered behind the scenes, gave a lightning talk, and connected with some amazing people in the C++ community. If you‚Äôve ever considered attending CppCon, or want to do more than just sit in the audience, this post is for you.\nCppCon isn‚Äôt just for language experts. It‚Äôs a welcoming space for learners, contributors, and quiet observers too. Here‚Äôs what made it special for me:\nüåü Volunteering gave me a peek behind the curtain and introduced me to people I wouldn‚Äôt have met otherwise.\nüé§ Giving a lightning talk helped me push past hesitation and find my voice in front of a supportive crowd.\nü§ù Networking events like the Women‚Äôs Lunch and Community Dinner offered real connections, not just business cards.\nSubmit something even if you‚Äôre unsure. A 5-minute talk can open doors and build confidence.\nSay yes to volunteering. You learn, help others, and become part of the community fast.\nPlan your schedule but allow for serendipity. Some of the best moments happen between sessions.\nJoin the Discord. Many friendships and insights start there before the conference even begins.\nIf you're curious about what the week looked like in detail ‚Äî including anecdotes, reflections, and key sessions ‚Äî check out my full trip report here:\nüëâ CppCon 2024: My Journey as a Speaker, Volunteer, and First-Time Attendee\nThanks for reading!

This helps keep things fair and prevents account sharing.\nIf someone logs in from another device, the previous session gets logged out automatically.\nSecure password resets and soon, two-factor authentication!\nMeanwhile, my buddy Abir is crafting the frontend using HTML and Tailwind CSS, making sure everything looks slick and works smoothly.\nOur other friends ‚Äî Siam, Rajib, and Omair ‚Äî are helping with content, testing, and planning new features.\nOur goal?

          "description": "Artificial intelligence has long been promoted as the next frontier in drug discovery. It promised faster timelines, lower costs, and more precise targeting of disease. But recent updates from the field suggest that the reality is more complicated. Despite the billions invested, the AI drug discovery revolution is hitting the brakes, at least for now.\nA new article published in Drug Target Review outlines a set of major challenges. AI models struggle to interpret complex biological systems, and there is still no standard process for validating or approving AI-generated drug candidates. The piece highlights that although AI can speed up discovery, it often underperforms when it comes to robustness, data integration, and real clinical translation.\nYou can read the full article here:\nhttps://www.drugtargetreview.com/article/157270/navigating-the-ai-revolution-a-roadmap-for-pharmas-future/\nAnother recent paper published in Science takes a similarly measured tone. While it acknowledges the potential of AI in areas like molecular generation and structure prediction, it also points out that most applications remain in early stages. The authors argue that AI should support traditional workflows, not replace them, until more solid evidence of its impact emerges.\nRead the Science article here:\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx0339\nThese are not failures. They are reminders that scientific progress moves step by step. AI will likely become essential to future drug pipelines, but the timeline may be longer and more incremental than early hype suggested.",
