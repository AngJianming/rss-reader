          "description": "Today marks the final day of my second month-long blogging challenge. The first was in August last year. This one, in May, felt different -- but just as transformative.\nHere are my takeaways.\nI have a few jobs to do, with different hats to wear. I also have a family. So, blogging almost always happened late in the evenings.\nSome evenings I had not even thought about what to write until 9pm-10pm. Then I had to find a topic, write, and publish. It was stressful and felt like a grind. But this taught me something important: grind is everywhere.\nIf you are a marketer, you grind to get leads. If you are a developer, you grind to fix bugs and run chores for housekeeping. The examples may change, but the grind stays.\nIf your job never feels like a grind, maybe you are lucky. But maybe not.
