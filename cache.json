Some services are critical lower tiered services, that everything depends on, and some services are less critical higher tiered services.  So, like the network is a lower tier service that everything depends on, and DNS depends on the network, and your service depends on DNS to communicate with other services like your database.  Your database is more critical then your service, as maybe multiple services talk to the same database, and so your database shouldn't have a dependency on your service, and thus go down when your service goes down, likewise, your network shouldn't be dependent on any of your services, especially if those services are considered non-critical, or …",

Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. \nThe finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. \nSemiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act.
