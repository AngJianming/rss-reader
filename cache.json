The highest-performing teams will be defined by the proprietary AI systems they've built, customized for their specific codebases, architectural patterns, and business domains. These teams will wield AI as a strategic differentiator, not merely consume it.\nThis is where our industry is clearly headed. As AI increasingly becomes the primary author of code across industries, the strategic advantage will shift from who can write the best code to who can best direct, customize, and optimize AI systems to write that code.\nThe best engineering teams won't achieve these results by simply adopting off-the-shelf AI coding tool‚Ä¶",

One particular project sticks in my mind ‚Äî a team of ten people, dozens of microservices, and a lot of GitLab repositories to manage.\nDuring each sprint, we were juggling features across multiple repos. At the same time, we were responsible for reviewing each other‚Äôs code. Our typical flow was:\nOpen a merge request (MR) on GitLab\nMove the related Jira ticket\nShare the MR link in a Teams channel\nMove on to the next story\nWhen the workload was light, it was manageable. But in busy sprints, reviews piled up quickly. Large MRs got ignored, or rushed through. And tracking what was waiting, what was blocked, or what still needed input? A mess.\nWe experimented with several ideas:\nUsing GitLab labels like needs-review or blocked\nAdding Jira tags\nRotating reviewer ownership by repo each sprint\nThey helped ‚Äî but they didn‚Äôt solve the root problem: lack of visibility and timing.\nCode reviews were often asynchronous and scattered. We were switching contexts constantly, jumping between repos, and forgetting which contributions needed our attention.\nWe didn‚Äôt need more tools ‚Äî we needed a better way to surface and track reviews. Something that would:\nGive us a unified view of MRs\nLet us know what‚Äôs ready to merge, what‚Äôs waiting, and what‚Äôs blocked\nRespect our flow, instead of interrupting it\nThat‚Äôs when I started working on a side project, aiming to solve this specific pain point.\nThat side project became Bellugo ‚Äî a contribution tracker designed to help teams stay on top of reviews across repositories without the chaos.\nIt‚Äôs still a work in progress, but if this resonates with your team, I‚Äôd love for you to check out the landing page and maybe join the private beta waitlist.",

          "description": "Notcoin, one of the most prominent Web3 gaming projects of 2024, said the tap-to-earn genre is ‚Äúprobably dead‚Äù as Web3 gaming shifts to more fun and engaging projects.\nDuring Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming.¬†\nVladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players‚Äô interests.¬†\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they‚Äôre not sustainable,‚Äù he said.¬†\nNotcoin‚Äôs Sasha Plotvinov (left), Uliana Salo (middle) and Vladimir Plotvinov (right) at the Token2049 event in Dubai.

It‚Äôs like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time.¬†\nThese virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.\nIn industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made.
