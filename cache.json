However, the frontier of AI is already pushing beyond these prompt-response paradigms. The next significant leap is the rise of autonomous AI agents: sophisticated systems that can understand goals, devise plans, execute multi-step tasks, and even self-correct to achieve objectives with minimal human intervention. These agents represent a paradigm shift, moving from AI that responds to AI that acts and achieves.\nAt its core, an AI agent leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as its cognitive engine.

Many organizations focus solely on uptime, however, this limited approach leaves networks vulnerable to numerous performance issues that can impact business operations.\nWe've found that a comprehensive network performance measurement definition encompasses multiple metrics including bandwidth usage, packet loss, efficiency, and availability. Active network performance measurement allows us to distinguish between application problems and data transmission issues, leading to more precise problem detection. \nIn this article, we'll explore why uptime alone is insufficient for modern networks, identify the key metrics you should be monitoring, and demonstrate how real-time monitoring tools can prevent service…",
