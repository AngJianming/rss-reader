          "description": "Alright fellow devs, the AI wave is here, and even us \"old school coders\" are evolving! I've been shaping my workflow as a Generative Coder, trying to blend decades of experience with the power of tools like Gemini, Claude, GPT, and the speed of Cursor IDE (while still loving WebStorm for its strengths!).\nMy current process is a 3-step dance:\nAI Huddle (with Gemini): Brainstorming needs & context.\nCharting the Course: Human-led user flows & requirements.\nThe Generative Relay: Iterative prompting (Claude in Cursor, GPT/Gemini for second opinions), reviewing, and refining.\nIt's exciting, but I'm on a mission to make it perfectly efficient – fewer re-prompts, tighter loops, and more time for big-picture design. I’m an engineer, after all; it should be a crystal-clear development process! (Even if that first-shot perfect result from AI is still a dream 😉).\nFor a more detailed breakdown of my current tools and process, you can read the full post on my blog:\nhttps://goker.me/my-generative-coding-workflow\nBut here on dev.to, I really want to hear from YOU!\nWhat does your AI-assisted workflow look like?\nWhich tools are you finding indispensable?\nHow are you tackling the iteration cycles and review process?\nWhat are your tips for building faster, smarter, and better as a Generative Coder?\nDrop your insights, workflows, and war stories in the comments below!

Sometimes, developers want to prevent dialogs from being closed by the system back key. The ArkTS @CustomDialog component does not support intercepting the system back key, but you can achieve this by using the Navigation component's NavDestination to intercept the back event and create dialogs that cannot be dismissed arbitrarily.\nUse the NavDestination component and set .mode(NavDestinationMode.DIALOG) to display the page as a dialog.\nIntercept the system back event by returning true in .onBackPressed(() => true), which prevents the dialog from being closed by the back key.\nSet .backgroundColor(\"#99000000\") to create a semi-tr…",

This article will further guide you to encapsulate the Navigation routing framework, making it suitable for more complex project structures, supporting dynamic module loading, page parameter passing, callbacks, and other advanced features to improve maintainability and scalability.\nAs your project grows, the number of pages and modules will increase. To facilitate management and decoupling, it is recommended to encapsulate routing logic in a unified way. The core ideas are as follows:\nUse a RouterInfo class to describe each page's module name, page name, and whether it requires NavDestination.\nUse RouterPage to centrally manage all page information for easy lookup and…",

One common and essential solution to this is a retry mechanism, a pattern that automatically re-attempts a failed operation after a delay.\nIn this blog post, we’re going to explore how to build retryable asynchronous APIs using Python. We’ll walk through how to use functools.partial in combination with custom async decorators to create flexible, reusable retry logic.
