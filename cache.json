You can work on just one part of the system without touching the rest, and teams can move faster without stepping on each other‚Äôs toes.\nHowever, microservices also come with challenges, particularly when handling errors. With so many moving parts, it becomes harder to pinpoint exactly where something went wrong.

It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in web development.\nComponent-Based: UIs are built using components, which are reusable pieces of code that define how a part of the interface should look and behave.\nJSX Syntax: Uses a special syntax called JSX, which allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.\nVirtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering. Instead of updating the real DOM directly, it updates a lightweight copy first, then efficiently updates only the parts that changed.\nUnidirectional Data Flow: Data in React flows in one direction, making it easier to understand and debug applications.‚Ä¶",
