So let’s go through the these steps to build a web strategy that actually works.\nThink about it this way: a website is something you have to pay for. But a website with a clear, well-executed strategy behind it? That’s something that pays for itself — again and again — by bringing in new customers. But that only happens if you get it right.\nOne of the biggest mistakes I see companies make is this. When it’s time to redo their website, they start thinking in terms of a redesign. So they go out and hire a web designer, who may or may not do any real discovery work to put a strategy in p…",

Instead, it refreshes like it’s being powered by a sleepy tortoise using dial-up. My cat is judging me.
