Even with digital access to people across the globe, human connection seems harder and harder to come by.

          "description": "The government of El Salvador continues stacking Bitcoin (BTC) for its national crypto reserve, despite an ongoing deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) stipulating that the Central American country stop using public funds to purchase Bitcoin as one of the conditions for a loan agreement.\nAccording to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million.\nEl Salvador's Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases.\nThe Central American country is one of the only nations actively purchasing Bitcoin in open market operations, and its national …",

The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages in the original case.\nThe investors continue to claim that Binance's 2019 delisting of BSV and similar major exchange delistings are the primary drivers of BSV's long-term price decline and its failure to attract the investor atten…",

          "description": "Opinion by: Kevin Rusher, founder of RAAC\nIt’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.\nWhile gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…",
