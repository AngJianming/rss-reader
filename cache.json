          "description": "从零开始的Hyperlane框架学习之旅：一个大三学生的真实体验\n\n\n作为一名大三计算机系的学生，我在上学期的分布式系统课程项目中初次接触到了 Hyperlane 这个 Rust HTTP 框架。从最初的好奇到后来的深入使用，这个框架给我留下了深刻的印象。今天，我想分享一下我使用 Hyperlane 的心路历程。\n第一次看到 Hyperlane 的文档时，我就被它的设计理念所吸引。作为一个性能导向的轻量级框架，它在保持高性能的同时，还提供了非常友好的开发体验。\n首先，我只需要在 Cargo.toml 中添加一行依赖：\n[dependencies]\nhyperlane = \"5.25.1\"\n\n相比其他框架动辄几十个依赖项，Hyperlane 只依赖 Tokio 和标准库，这让我在项目初始化时就感受到了它的轻量级特性。\n在传统框架中，获取请求方法可能需要这样写：\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();\n\n而 Hyperlane 提供了更优雅的方式：\nlet method = ctx.get_request_method().await;\n\n这种扁平化的 API 设计让代码更加清晰易读，也减少了查阅文档的次数。\n#[methods(get, post)]\nasync fn root_route(ctx: Context) {\n    ctx.set_response_status_code(200)\n        .await\n        .set_response_body(\"Hello hyperlane => /\")\n        .await;\n}\n\n这种组合式的路由注解比其他框架一个个声明方法要简洁得多。\nserver.route(\"/goods/{id:\\\\d+}\", |ctx| async move {\n    let id = ctx.get_route_param(\"id\").await.parse::<u32>().unwrap();\n    // 数据库查询逻辑...\n}).await;\n\n内置的正则表达式支持让路由匹配更加灵活，不需要额外的插件。\n在 AWS t2.micro 实例上进行压力测试：\nwrk -c360 -d60s http://localhost:8000/\n\n测试结果令人震惊：\n\n\n\n框架\nQPS\n\n\n\n\nTokio\n340,130\n\n\nHyperlane\n324,323\n\n\nRocket\n298,945\n\n\nGin (Go)\n242,570\n\n\n\n性能仅比底层的 Tokio 低 5%，但提供了完整的 Web 框架功能，这个数据让我在课程展示时收获了不少惊叹。\n#[get]\nasync fn ws_route(ctx: Context) {\n    let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();\n    let body = ctx.get_request_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(key).await.send_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(body).await.send_body().await;\n}\n\n无需额外的插件就能支持 WebSocket，这让我在实现实时聊天功能时省去了不少麻烦。\n在升级到 v4.89+ 版本时，我遇到了一些生命周期的变化：\n// v4.89+ 推荐的请求中断方式\nif should_abort {\n    ctx.aborted().await;\n    return;\n}\n\n但框架清晰的版本说明让我很快适应了这些变化。\nAPI 设计哲学：链式调用设计保持了 Rust 的优雅\n性能密码：建立在 Tokio 的异步架构和零拷贝处理之上\n中间件系统：洋葱模型提供了清晰的扩展点\n路由灵活性：在简单参数和正则表达式之间取得了平衡\n版本管理：仔细阅读 CHANGELOG 避免兼容性问题\n通过这次项目实践，我不仅掌握了 Hyperlane 框架，还对现代 Web 框架的设计理念有了深入的理解。接下来，我计划：\n深入研究 Hyperlane 的 WebSocket 支持\n探索框架如何在底层利用 Rust 的零成本抽象\n尝试基于 Hyperlane 构建微服务架构\nHyperlane 不仅仅是一个工具，它改变了我对编程的思考方式。每一次 ctx 调用，每一个中间件的编写，都在加深我对 Web 开发本质的理解。这个框架让我明白，性能和开发体验是可以兼得的，这就是 Rust 生态的魅力所在。",

But speed wasn't the only goal - I wanted to make log analysis actually enjoyable.\nWe've all been there: production issues at 3 AM, scrolling through endless logs, trying to spot patterns with tired eyes. Existing tools either:\nDump everything to stdout (grep, awk)\nRequire complex query languages (LogQL, KQL)\nNeed heavy infrastructure (ELK stack)\nCost a fortune (Datadog, Splunk)\nI wanted something that just works, runs locally, and makes patterns obvious.\nLogSum combines three things that rarely go together:\nBlazing fast performance - 3.3ms for 10K entries\nBeautiful terminal UI - with animations and colors\nIntelligent analysis - automatic pattern detection\n🔍 Smart Pattern De…",

Let's get back to our series about Amazon Verified Permissions!\nThe last few months haven't brought much news in AVP, other than the addition of tags (which should have been added a long time ago), but a few days before re:Inforce, we got a real game changer: a price change.\nAs we know, AVP has many advantages, but the biggest drawback has always been the price. For a new service, this made it very difficult for customers to adopt. I've conducted many workshops, talks, and a large implementation around AVP, but this pricing has always been a pain point for many people.\nIn this blog post, I want to share my perspective on the price change based on the use case I implemented with my team.\nUntil today, pricing looked like this: we paid for the number of authoriz…",
