          "description": "Pair programming is a worthwhile activity that I do in my apprenticeship. I practice pair programming during my in-class workshops. I also participate in pair programming with my partner for our capstone project. This activity has given me lots of practice working with someone to solve a problem. I do believe I learned valuable lessons about programming and teamwork because of this.\nIt may seem obvious, but pair programming really shows the importance of being able to communicate effectively. Conveying your ideas in an understandable and meaningful way is important to minimize confusion and ensure everyone is on the same page. Another lesson that I learned is that it is beneficial to ask questions and ask for assistance if needed. Every time I needed help, my coding partners were happily willing to give an answer or clarification as needed. I also learned that coding together is an excellent way to improve and share knowledge with peers.\nPracticing pair programming is a superb way to give early-career software engineers some hands-on experience in that environment. Since it is common to code in a team professionally, pair programming practice provides a terrific glimpse into how to maneuver in that environment. Coding with others allows one to develop not only their hard skills but also improve soft skills as well.\nGoing forward, I think the best way to get more out of these experiences would be to expose myself to more pair programming. Additionally, going into these sessions with a goal in mind is a fantastic idea. For example, one day complete an exercise with a focus on working on your communication and asking questions. Then, on another day, challenge yourself by trying a different language. Another way to get the most out of pair programming is practicing being the driver and the navigator.",

So excited that I can't resist learning more and more by watching content from seasoned developers. Recently, I came across a video titled \"map() and filter() in Python!\" This piqued my interest because I hadn't been taught these inbuilt functions; I had only ever been taught how to approximate these using list comprehensions.\nI thought to myself \"Surely an inbuilt function for such a thing MUST be better than typing out an entire comprehension!\" After watching the video and learning the functions, I still felt unclear on whether or not these functions would be superior to list comprehensions.

Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. \nInvestigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. \nThe stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…",
