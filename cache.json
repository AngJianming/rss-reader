Not because it’s super complicated — but because my laptop is slow, my internet is slower, and everything just felt like it was moving in slow motion. It was frustrating, but I finally got it done.\nThat one task pushed me to 25% of The Odin Project’s Foundations course. It’s a small step, but it feels huge right now.\nAfter that, I looked at the next topic: Git Basics. And wow... it’s a lot. There’s so much reading, understanding, and hands-on stuff. I could tell right away I’d need a fresh, rested brain to tackle it — and today was definitely not that day.\nTo be honest, I’m completely drained. My sleep schedule is all over the place. I barely know what day it is anymore. I even missed my Duolingo streak — opened the app and it hit me:\nI try to plan things, but it’s hard. Everything takes longer than expected, and I get distracted so easily. I don’t even take real breaks — I just lose track of time, then remember I needed a break hours later.\n\nToday was one of those days where ADHD really got in the way.\nAnyways, I’m not going to beat myself up over it. Some days are just rough. Some days all you can do is one thing — and that’s okay.\nI did what I could. Tomorrow, I’ll come back to it with a clearer head (hopefully after some actual sleep).\nAnd if you're going through something similar — just know you're not alone.",

          "description": "In a microservices architecture, separating concerns is critical for maintainability, scalability, and security. One key decision when building APIs is how and where to handle authentication. A common pattern is to delegate authentication to a dedicated authentication microservice, which issues tokens (e.g., JWTs), and use those tokens to access protected resources on independent backend APIs. When working on an infrastructure change, we faced the challenge of either integrating authentication in the Node.js backend (without the proper libraries) or maintaining a single backend solely for authorization.\nThe options we considered were:\nHaving the Go backend validate the token and proxy to the Node.js backend over authenticated routes.

          "description": "BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). \nAccording to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering\nCathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. \nCircle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.\nThe company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”\nRelated: Circle co-founder to create ‘AI-native’ bank after $18M raise\nUSDC market share\nWith a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).\nStablecoins by market cap.

However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.\nCircle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”\nMagazine: Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",

Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.\nEveryone loves to talk about decentralization.
