It does not work like synchronous programming, where tasks are executed one after the other. In order to run parallelly and perform better, asynchronous programming does not allow the code execution to wait for any time-consuming operations, be it the fetching of data from a server or reading files.\nIn this, functions are executed independently of the main program flow. It means, if one task is processing, the rest of the program can continue running and executing other tasks without waiting for asynchronous operation to finish.
