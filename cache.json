Their affordability and compatibility with budget-friendly, China-made devices further enhance their appeal, making them an attractive choice for many engineers and developers.\nHowever, these PLCs come with certain limitations—particularly in the IDE environment. I primarily use GX Works 2, and while it provides Structured Text (ST) programming, its implementation is fairly restricted compared to even older versions like CoDeSys 2.3. That said, the fact that ST is available at all is a significant advantage. Despite its limitations, GX Works 2 remains highly capable of solving most automation tasks.\nOn…",

          "description": "Manufacturing has always been a complex dance of materials, machines, and manpower. But in the age of Industry 4.0, this dance is becoming increasingly orchestrated by artificial intelligence. Smart factories are leveraging AI to automate one of the most critical — and traditionally inflexible — components of production: scheduling.\nAt a glance, production scheduling seems straightforward — align machines, materials, and manpower to meet delivery targets. But developers and system engineers working in manufacturing tech know how deep the rabbit hole goes: real-time constraint handling, machine availability, order priorities, predictive maintenance data, and more.\nHere's how AI is changing the game:\nAI scheduling engines use reinforcement learning and constraint programming to simulate optimal workflows.\nDigital twins enable testing of scheduling scenarios before real-world deployment.\nIoT data integration supports real-time responsiveness to production floor events.\nPredictive analytics anticipate demand spikes, raw material shortages, and equipment failures.\nThis means software architects are now designing systems that not only collect data but act on it in milliseconds — a feat that's rewriting efficiency benchmarks across industries.\n💡 Read how AI scheduling is being implemented in smart factory environments and what tech stacks and architectures are driving this shift:\nRead full blog here.",

This process is called authentication (verifying the identity of the requesting party) and authorization (determining their access rights). \nOAuth 2.0 has become the go-to protocol for authorization and access delegation, which facilitates fast and secure authentication and authorization for users to APIs, servers, devices, and apps. This is done without sharing any user credentials, like passwords. Instead, access tokens are used to prove an identity, keeping user credentials safe.

It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.\nAnd yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back?
