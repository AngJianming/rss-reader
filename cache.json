Here‚Äôs how you can set up the game on your own machine:\nClone the Repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/afnank070/flappy-bird-amazon-q-cli\n\nNavigate to the Project Folder:\ncd flappy-bird-python\n\nInstall Pygame:\npip install pygame\n\nRun the Game:\nflappy_bird.py\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBuilding this game was an absolute blast!

Every framework, every methodology, every 'proven system' for building a business. I could probably teach a course on startup theory at this point.\nBut theory doesn't ship products. Theory doesn't get customers. Theory doesn't generate revenue.\nSo today I'm switching from learning to building. One roadmap, one focus, public accountability.\nThis isn't another 'follow my journey' post. This is documentation for my future self and anyone else stuck in the same cycle.\nThe plan: build something, measure what matters, iterate based on real feedback from real users.\nRevolutionary, I know.\nFirst commit coming tomorrow. Time to write some code that actually solves a problem instead of just following along with tutorials.\nWho's with me?",
