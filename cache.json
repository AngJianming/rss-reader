While both affect your sense of balance, they are distinct conditions with different causes and treatment methods. Dizziness is a general term that describes the feeling of being lightheaded or unsteady, while vertigo refers to the sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning, even when you are not moving.\nBoth dizziness and vertigo can significantly impact your daily activities and quality of life.
