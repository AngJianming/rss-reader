Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.\nSupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.\nsupaseeder.vercel.app üî•\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works\n\n\n\n\nProvide Supabase URL & Anon Key\n\nConnects to your database and reads the schema.\n\n\nWrite a prompt\n\nDescribe the data you want (e.g. \"10 users with 5 posts each\").\n\n\nPick mode\n\n\n\n\n\nPrompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)\nDirect Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI\nGet SQL output\nCopy & paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.\nClone the repository:\n\n\n\n\n   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git\n   cd supaseeder\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n\n\n   npm install\n   # or\n   yarn install\n   # or\n   pnpm install\n\nStart the development server:\n\n\n\n\n   npm run dev\n   # or\n   yarn dev\n   # or\n   pnpm dev",

If you like these kinds of analysis, you should join AImodels.fyi or follow us on Twitter.\nThe controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model is a powerful AI tool created by Usama Ehsan that combines several advanced techniques to generate high-quality, realistic images. It builds upon the ControlNet and Realistic Vision models, incorporating techniques like multi-ControlNet, single-ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and consistency-decoder to produce remarkably realistic and visually stunning outputs.\nThe controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model takes a variety of inputs, including an image, a prompt, and various parameters to fine-tune the generation process. The output is a high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.\nImage: The input image that serves as a reference or starting point for the generation process.\nPrompt: A text description that guides the model in generating the desired image.\nSeed: A numerical value that can be used to randomize the generation process.\nSteps: The number of inference steps to be taken during the generation process.\nStrength: The strength or weight of the control signal, which determines how much the model should focus on the input image.\nMax Width/Height: The maximum dimensions of the generated image.\nGuidance Scale: A parameter that controls the balance between the input prompt and the control signal.\nNegative Prompt: A text description that specifies elements to be avoided in the generated image.\nOutput Image: The generated, high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.\nThe `controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision...\nClick here to read the full guide to Controlnet-1.1-X-Realistic-Vision-V2.0",

This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.\nHowever, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.\nThis highlights the importance of ‚Ä¶",
