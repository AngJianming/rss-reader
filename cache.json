While milk chocolate and sugary confections dominate the dessert tables, dark chocolate has quietly risen to prominence as a healthier, smarter swap‚Äîespecially for those post-meal sweet cravings. With its rich flavor, lower sugar content, and surprising array of health benefits, dark chocolate is no longer just a treat; it's a strategic choice for both the palate and the body.\nSo why is dark chocolate the superior pick for post-meal indulgence? Let's unwrap the facts.\nDark chocolate, especially varieties containing at least 70% cocoa, is loaded with nutrients and powerful antioxidants.

This topic often arises among C++ developers, particularly with the challenges posed by object slicing when dealing with base and derived classes. The crux of the issue lies in the behavior of STL containers and how they handle objects.\nIn C++, when we store derived class instances in a container that holds base class objects by value, object slicing occurs, which results in the loss of the derived class-specific behaviour. This article aims to explore this concept specifically within the context of C++11 and later revisions, dissecting the challenges and potential approaches.\nUnderstanding the Slicing Problem\nWhen you store a derived class object in a container designed to hold objects of its base class by value‚Ä¶",
