That‚Äôs a gap I couldn‚Äôt ignore.\nAs a self-taught developer, I spent years battling syntax errors, inconsistent tooling, and steep learning curves ‚Äî not because I lacked motivation, but because the language design just wasn't made for brains like mine.\nSo I built Sona ‚Äî an open-source programming language designed to simplify coding, reduce friction, and empower creativity.\nWhat Makes Sona Unique?\nMinimal, readable syntax (inspired by Python, Rust, and Go)\nREPL-first development (Sona v0.4.3 just launched!)\nModules that feel native and expressive (import fs, stdin.input(), etc.)\nDesigned for focus + accessibility, including neurodivergent users\nFully open-source, interpreter built with Python + Lark\nCurrent Progress\n‚úÖ Interpreter up to v0.4.3\n\n‚úÖ 12+ core modules complete (fs, http, json, env, stdin, etc.)\n\n‚úÖ REPL mode: multiline function support, :env commands, graceful errors\n\n‚úÖ Preparing for public alpha (v1.0)\nCall to Action\nThis is your invitation to help shape the future of dev tooling.\nüëâ Try Sona. Star it. Fork it. Build something with it.\n\nüëâ Join our mission to make programming more inclusive.\nüåç [https://github.com/Bryantad/Sona\nWant to contribute or support? DM me here",
