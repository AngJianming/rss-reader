Its built-in routing, SEO support, and other benefits made it a no-brainer over plain React when building full-stack web applications. But there’s one thing that’s been consistently frustrating:\nThe development speed is painfully slow.\nNext.js Hot Reload is supposed to make updates from your code to the browser faster, but really, every small code change feels like waiting for a full rebuild. I experience freezing pages and lagging terminals, even when working on something as simple as a landing page. It really makes me question if this is truly the \"React on steroids\" that everyone talks about.\nI've worked on Vite + React projects, and I recalled the development speed was never this slow regardless of how complex the project was, so I d…",

From AI voice assistants to mobile apps that generate music, design interiors, or create short-form content in seconds. The market is growing fast, with consumer AI projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nBut for developers, building these kinds of apps isn’t always easy and straightforward. Combining a number of AI models like transcription, summarization, and speech synthesis usually means working with multiple APIs, authenticating, dealing with latency and keeping costs under control. That’s where the real issue lies. Developers need to move fast, but the complexity of stitching models together slows everything down.\nEachlabs aims to fix that.

Once it’s ready, you’ll see a prompt where you can start chatting:\n>>> Why is the sky blue?  \nThe sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered more by air molecules than the longer red wavelengths. This scattered blue light comes to us from all directions in the sky, making the sky appear blue during the day.\n\nTo exit the Ollama terminal, you can:\n  Type  /bye  and press Enter\n  Press Ctrl+D (on macOS/Linux)\n  Press Ctrl+C twice\nHere are some useful commands to get you started:\n### List all your downloaded models  \nollama list\n\n### Download a model without running it  \nollama pull llama3.2:1b\n\n### Remove a model you no longer need  \nollama rm llama3.2:1b\n\n### Get information about a model  \nollama info llama3.2:1b\n\nOnce you’re comfortable with the basics, you can try the Ollama Python library to integrate it in your Python applications.

The main question is whether this behavior is intended by the C++ standards or if it's a quirk due to the compiler or operating system I am using.\nUnderstanding std::byte\nThe std::byte type introduced in C++17 is designed to encapsulate the idea of a byte without its conventional mathematical interpretations. Unlike integers, std::byte doesn't implicitly convert to numeric types, which can lead to some interesting outcomes when performing operations with it. In the example I encountered, I defined a std::byte variable and used std::to_integer to convert it to different integer types.\nThe Code Example\nHere’s the code snippet that raised my que…",

It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.\nAnd yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?\nThe harsh reality is that decentralized social networks hav…",

That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty.
