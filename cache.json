Traditional rule-based automation is struggling to keep up.\nTraditional automation tools like Zapier, Make, and basic RPA (Robotic Process Automation) platforms helped companies automate repetitive tasks. These systems operate on \"if-this-then-that\" logic.\nHowever, they have significant limitations:\nLack of Adaptability: Even small deviations, like a changed email format, can cause failures.\nNo Contextual Understanding: They cannot interpret unstructured data, sentiment, or nuance.\nConstant Maintenance: Business process changes requi…",

But quickly realized it doesn’t fit my current goals. Go requires more time to master and lacks the quick feedback loop I get with JavaScript and Node.js. For now, I prioritize skills and tools that help me earn money faster and build complete products.\nTo keep building SaaS products and freelance projects that improve my skills and generate income. Practical experience and fast results are key at my age.\nI’ll continue focusing on JavaScript, Next.js, and NestJS, then later consider other backend languages like Go or Rust when I’m ready for bigger challenges.\nThanks for reading!

          "description": "Opinion by: Jennifer Dodgson, co-founder of KIP Protocol and Eigenform AI\nThe puppet show is ending.\nThe Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.\nIf AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…",

The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.\nThink of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…",

This forced miners to rethink their operations, optimize efficiency, cut energy costs and upgrade hardware to remain profitable. Cointelegraph Research, with insights from industry experts at Uminers, examines this transformation in its latest report. The analysis covers ASIC efficiency improvements, corporate performance, geographical expansion and new revenue models.
