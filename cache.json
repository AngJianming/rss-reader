But not all segmentation is created equal. There are four primary types, each serving a distinct purpose and offering increasing levels of detail and understanding.\nAt its most fundamental level, Image Segmentation divides an image into logical groups of pixels based on criteria like color, texture, or intensity. Think of it as drawing boundaries around areas with shared characteristics.\nGroups pixels into regions (e.g., \"this blob is a tree\").\nOutputs contours (outlines) or masks (filled areas).\nUses pseudo-coloring to differentiate segments visually.\nIsolate distinct pixel groupings without assigning semantic meaning.\nBuildin…",

But it lacks when it comes to dynamically updating UI without pushing new app updates. To solve it, let's explore Stac, a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Flutter.\nRather than jumping into stac directly, let’s first discuss about UI approaches.\n\nIn the general Client-Driven UI approach, the app’s UI is tightly coupled with its codebase. Essentially, the client (your app) handles everything, UI layouts, business logic, and rendering. Want to change button's look or add a new feature? You’ll need to update the app’s code, test it, and then push the update to the app stores. And then you have to wait for approvals from stores then wait for users to their apps.\nLimitations of Client-Driven UI:\n1. S…",

Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. \nThe finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%.
