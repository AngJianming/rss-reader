This could be related to databases, scraping information, or other heavy-lifting tasks.

When people stopped believing in themselves and each other, Blockchain appeared. When people lost their minds, Artificial Intelligence appeared. We have only one step left - to combine AI with Blockchain and create a Global Social Consensus --> DAO\n. Just imagine. A super AI algorithm, to which people trust their experiences, describes the identified social problems and immediately offers solutions to these problems with the participation of the people themselves, taking into account our capabilities, which we tell the same algorithm about. This is more than an Algorithm - this is an application to create an AI President of the whole world. If you think about it, we have no choice.
