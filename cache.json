People are working more for less and wondering, “Why the hell am I still doing this?”\nIf you're burnt out, jaded, or secretly Googling “alternative careers for software developers”, you're not alone. But the real question is: should you actually quit tech?\nLet’s break it down.\nBurnout Isn’t Always About the Work\n\n\nSometimes it’s not coding that’s the problem - it’s everything around it.\nToxic team dynamics?

          "description": "In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, cloud adoption isn’t optional, it’s foundational.\nEvery week, we see headlines about major breaches, and more often than not, the root cause isn’t a failure of cloud technology, but a misstep in how it was configured or maintained.\nHere’s the harsh truth:\nMost cloud security failures stem from simple oversights, not sophisticated attacks.\nSo why does it happen?\nWhat starts out as “temporary access for debugging” becomes permanent. A test database never gets encrypted. Firewall rules get opened in a rush to meet a deadline and never closed.\nWe’ve worked with companies across industries from fintech to gaming and we've noticed a recurring pattern:\nTeams think they’re secure because they’ve “enabled encryption” or “set up IAM roles.”\nBut security is not a one-time setup. It’s an ongoing practice. A mindset. A framework.\nLet’s walk through a few eye-opening examples:\n•IAM Management: Are you reviewing and revoking stale access regularly?\n•Monitoring: Do you have alerting for unusual activity like access from a new IP or a sudden spike in data transfer?\n•Patching: Are your services and containers being scanned and patched automatically?\nIf even one of these makes you pause then your infrastructure might be more vulnerable than you think.\nAnd here’s what’s worse:\nWe help growing businesses and modern DevOps teams design resilient, secure, and compliant cloud infrastructure. Whether you’re on AWS, Azure, or GCP we’ve put together a complete guide that covers:\n•Top cloud security risks to watch in 2025\n📘 Read the full breakdown here →",

But maintaining visual integrity through endless updates, design tweaks, and responsive changes is no easy feat. QA engineers often turn to visual testing to ensure nothing breaks visually after each deployment.\nYet, not all visual testing methods are created equal. Traditional pixel-by-pixel comparison may seem precise on paper, but it can cause more confusion than clarity. Minor anti-aliasing differences, font rendering changes across browsers, or even a slightly shifted shadow can throw up red flags—false ones.

          "description": "In today's fast-paced tech world, speed matters. But quality matters even more. No one wants to launch a product full of bugs or deliver a user experience that doesn't live up to expectations. That's where quality assurance (QA) comes in - not as a final check, but as an ongoing, strategic process that ensures everything runs smoothly from the start.\nOne of the biggest mistakes companies make is putting off QA until later. By then, fixing issues becomes expensive and time-consuming. A robust QA process starts right from the planning stage.\nQA shouldn't be an island. Developers, designers, project managers, and QA engineers should work as a team. Communication is key. Clear documentation, shared expectations, and open feedback loops help avoid misunderstandings and missed bugs.\nYou can't fix what you don't track. That's why a well-defined test plan is essential. It sets expectations, outlines goals, and defines what success looks like.\nManual testing has its place, especially when it comes to exploratory testing or checking visual and UX elements. But automation is the backbone of a scalable QA process.\nSmoke tests\nRegression tests\nAPI testing\nCross-browser checks\nTools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright can help speed up the process. Don't overdo it with automation, though - maintaining flaky tests can slow down your team more than it helps.\nPro tip: CI/CD integration\nHook automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. That way, every time new code is pushed out, it's tested instantly. Faster feedback = fewer issues in production.\nMore in our article: https://instandart.com/blog/quality-assurance/how-to-build-a-bulletproof-qa-process/",

Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.\nGarcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…",

          "description": "Opinion by: Barna Kiss, CEO of Malda\nAn idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.\n\nLiquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat\nIn traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …",
