Translation-first drills, tone neglect and romaji reliance hard-wire shortcuts that require extra effort to undo later.\nEvidence is mixed. Some studies show gains for absolute beginners, yet long-term, multi-skill proficiency remains unproven.\nDesign matters. Apps that force desirable difficulty, provide real pronunciation feedback, and measure progress by ability, not activity, build habits that scale to real-world use—the philosophy underpinning YAP.\nReady to swap surface-level streaks for skills you can take outside the app?

          "description": "Java 8 introduced the Stream API, which allows for functional-style operations on collections. One of the most common use cases is filtering a collection based on certain conditions. In this article, we'll explore how to filter a collection using streams in Java, covering the basics, advanced techniques, and best practices.\nJava streams are a sequence of elements supporting parallel and functional-style operations. They're designed to work with collections, allowing you to process data in a declarative way. Streams don't store data; instead, they provide a pipeline for processing data.\nTo understand Java streams, let's consider an analogy. Imagine you're at a coffee shop, and you want to order a coffee. You don't need to know how the coffee is made; you simply tell the barista what you wan…",

          "description": "🔍 What is ACID?\n\n\nACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability — four key properties that ensure reliable, safe, and predictable database transactions.\n\nTogether, they guarantee that your data remains accurate and stable, even in the face of errors or system crashes.\nImagine a user named Alice is signing up on your website. Here's what happens behind the scenes:\nA row is added to the users table.\nA matching row is created in the profile table with default info.\nA welcome product is added for her in the products table.\nNow let’s walk through ACID using this scenario:\nAtomicity\n\n\n\nAll or nothing. Either the entire operation completes, or nothing does.\n💡 If Alice's users entry is created but something fails while inserting into the profile table, Atomicity ensures that the entire signup is rolled back — no partial data!\nConsistency\n\n\n\nData must move from one valid state to another, maintaining all rules and constraints.\n💡 Suppose your app ensures every profile must have a linked user_id from the users table. Consistency makes sure this rule is never broken — if a profile is created, the related user must exist.\nIsolation\n\n\n\nTransactions don’t interfere with each other; each feels like it's running alone.\n💡 While Alice is signing up, Bob is updating his profile. Isolation ensures these actions don’t clash — Bob doesn’t see Alice’s half-complete signup, and vice versa.\nDurability\n\n\n\nOnce committed, the transaction stays committed — even if the system crashes.\n💡 After Alice completes her signup, even if the server crashes right after, the new entries in users, profile, and products remain safe and saved. That's Durability.\n✅ So next time you're working with databases, remember:\n\nACID = Trustworthy Transactions 💡\n\nThey silently keep your app stable, safe, and smart.",
