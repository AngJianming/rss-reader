We explore how integrating artificial intelligence with time series data—from stock prices to sensor logs—creates a wealth of predictive insights. The post covers the background and context of these emerging technologies, key concepts such as large models (e.g., TimeGPT), blockchain-based Data NFTs, and strategies to optimize and monetize temporal data. We further discuss practical use cases in finance, healthcare, and energy, outline challenges and limitations, and peek into a future where decentralized data markets and synthetic data transform AI training.

Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.\nAnother bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025.
