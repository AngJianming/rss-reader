Libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte dominate the landscape, each tailored to enable developers to create dynamic user interfaces with a reactive data flow. However, the principles underlying these frameworks can be distilled into fundamentally simple concepts that can be implemented in vanilla JavaScript. This article aims to explore the implementation of a custom reactive library, examining its architecture, intricacies, and performance considerations.\nThe roots of reactive programming can be traced back to the late 1990s and early 2000s.

          "description": "As your cybersecurity toolkit grows, one concept becomes increasingly important—aggregation. Logs from a single server tell a story, but when you start working with networks of devices, cloud services, containers, and multiple endpoints, you quickly realize that analyzing one log file at a time is not enough. You need a way to bring those logs together, sort through the noise, and create a unified view of what is happening across your environment.\nThat is where log aggregation comes into play. By collecting and combining log data from multiple sources, you can detect patterns, respond faster to incidents, and make informed decisions. In this article, we will explore how to build simple but effective log aggregation workflows using Python, and why it is a powerful step forward in your secur…",

And… I did — after passing my exam, I started working on the project.\nAt the very beginning, I had to set up my AWS personal development environment to ensure that my account (and my wallet!) was properly protected. To do so, I decided to use AWS Organizations. I created a \"root\" AWS account and set up an AWS Organization with an Organizational Unit (OU) inside it. Under the OU, a new AWS account was created, and this was the account used to create any resources related to the project.\nAt this s…",

          "description": "Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said it had involved team members, including an executive, to fix a glitch that affected a single user who could not go through an Apple-based know-your-client (KYC) system.\nIn a May 18 X post, the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.\nOther people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team.

          "description": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. \nOn May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. \nRPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup. \n“A market structure dominated by a few RPC providers is one that will face strong pressure to depl…",
