If you run a business in the EU that offers websites, apps, digital tools, or online sales, it’s worth understanding what’s changing and how to respond.\nThe European Accessibility Act sets clear requirements to help people with disabilities access digital products and services. Starting June 28, 2025, these rules will apply across all EU countries, creating a single standard. That means fewer local differences and more focus on building useful, inclusive tools.\nIf your business is very small - under 10 employees and less than €2M in yearly turnover – you may be exempt. But even in that case, following accessibility principles can improve your product quality and user experience.\nIf you run an e-commerce site or …",

The boundaries between designers and developers are blurring as new tools empower designers to generate code and developers to generate designs. It’s not just about speeding up workflows- AI is changing what it means to build for the web. In this article, I’ll explore how AI is reshaping both roles and why we’re likely to see the rise of a new kind of professional - the Frontend Architect.\nAI-powered tools like Builder.io and Codia can now convert designs (e.g. from Figma) into working code. The quality of the code can be debated - and I've seen the drawbacks (the code is often messy, and you can forget about the usage of proper HTML elements) - but we can only expect the models to get better over time.\nIf you'd li…",
