Whether it’s achievements, streaks or leaderboards, all these features require continual tracking of user behavior to work.\nHere’s an example of the types of gamification experiences that can be powered by user behavior tracking:\n\nTrophy is a platform for building gamified experiences in any web or mobile application and provides developer-friendly APIs for tracking user interactions using metrics. Watch how Charlie integrates user behavior tracking into a NextJS application in under 5 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Key Points\n\n\n\nSet up a Trophy metric for each important user interaction.\nUse your existing user IDs, without managing any new IDs specifically for Trophy.\nTrophy has type-safe SDKs available in most major programming languages.\nTrophy can track interactions from a global user base, and provides APIs to fetch achievement and streak data in your users local timezone.\nTrophy can automatically send engagement email campaigns to your users from your custom domain using the proper inbox-friendly markup (<table> not <div>).\nThe integration in the video lays the foundations for building a great gamification experience. Once set up, Trophy metrics can support a wide range of features including:\nMulti-stage and one-off achievements\n\nDaily, weekly and monthly streaks\n\nAutomated emails for achievement unlocked, usage recap and win-back reactivation workflows.\nTrophy provides scalable user behavior tracking infrastructure built from the ground up with features designed to best aid building gamification experiences like achievements, streaks and re-engagement emails with no custom code.\nCreate a free account and start tracking user behavior using our developer-first APIs in just a few lines of code.",
