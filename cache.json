          "description": "When programming, we often need to make conditional judgments and choose to execute different blocks of code based on the result. In many programming languages, the most common way to do this is through the ternary operator. However, Python does not support the ternary operator. Interestingly, two of the most popular emerging languages, Go and Rust, also do not support it!\nWhy doesn't Python support the ternary operator? This article will mainly analyze the process behind Python's design of conditional syntax, explaining why it adopted a unique implementation. At the same time, we’ll examine why other languages have also abandoned the traditional ternary operator.\nThe ternary operator usually refers to ?:, with syntax in the form of: condition ? expression1 : expression2. If the condition …",

It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.\nWhat's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.\nA tale as old as time \nMarket manipu…",

DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said \"teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms.\" The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.\nRipple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:\n“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”\nTeach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers. \nRelated: The Giving Block starts disaster fund for California wildfire victims\nCrypto-fueled charity\nThe cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.\nAnother player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.\nMagazine: 6 Questions for Alex Wilson of The Giving Block",
