I decided to read up on it and even consulted AI to understand it better. Here's a summary of what I've learned!\nHexagonal Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture, has a primary goal: to isolate the main business logic (the \"inside\" or \"core\") from external concerns like databases, user interfaces, or third-party services (the \"outside\"). This concept might sound familiar if you know about the principle of separation of concerns. Indeed, the aim is to decouple the core logic from these external dependencies.\nSo, how does the outside logic communicate with the inside logic?
