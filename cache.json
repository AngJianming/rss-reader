          "description": "In Azure there's no Systems Manager, that's pretty obvious when you know that it's an AWS product. However, as both clouds are very large providers, Azure should offer something similar, right? As our focus is Session Manager, there's no direct equivalent that works in the same way. However, Microsoft offers us Azure Bastion - a managed service that creates a web interface for a jumpbox that supports both SSH and RDP. This is not the same as Session Manager as you still need keys or passwords but as Azure beginner, I will try to replicate this pattern as closely as possible. The setup I want to convert from AWS to Azure is shown below.\n\nOur goal is to create a secure environment, where the instance is in a private network (subnet) and is only accessible by managed services within Azure.

But when building interfaces with thousands of dynamic elements, high-frequency updates, or complex nested components, the default diffing and rendering behavior may become a bottleneck.\nUnderstanding and customizing LiveView’s rendering pipeline and diffing mechanics unlocks the ability to build ultra-responsive, large-scale UIs that push Phoenix to its limits while maintaining maintainability and developer ergonomics.\nAt a high level, LiveView renders assigns to HEEx templates, producing a tree of nodes representing the HTML DOM.

          "description": "Phoenix LiveView is fantastic for building interactive, real-time user interfaces with minimal JavaScript, but as your app grows more complex, you may face a common challenge: how to handle long-running or CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the LiveView process and freezing the UI.\nBy default, every LiveView runs inside its own process, responsible for handling events, rendering HTML, and maintaining state. This lightweight concurrency model means you get great responsiveness — until you don’t. If a user triggers an operation that takes more than a few milliseconds, like generating a PDF report, running a complex query, or processing uploaded files, your LiveView’s event handlers can become bottlenecks.
