          "description": "In 2025, we're still seeing a curious phenomenon in production: powerful multi-core servers running Node.js applications on just a single CPU core. This isn't because Node.js can't utilize multiple cores—it's because many developers have forgotten (or never learned) about Node's built-in clustering capabilities.\nNode.js uses a single-threaded event loop model by default. This is excellent for handling asynchronous operations efficiently but means your application can only utilize one CPU core—no matter how many cores your server has. In an era of 16, 32, or even 64-core machines, this represents a significant waste of computing resources.\nWhile developers often reach for external solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, or PM2, many overlook that Node.js ships with a native clustering solution: …",

In this article, we'll demonstrate how to transfer files from server A to server B, check for the existence of directories, and efficiently use LFTP commands.\nUnderstanding Directory Checks during LFTP Transfer\nWhen you're using LFTP for file transfers, it's critical to manage directories effectively. If a specific directory does not exist on the remote server, trying to upload files can result in errors.

          "description": "Understanding getHashCode() in C#\nWhen working with various controls or items in C#, particularly in Windows Phone 7 (WP7), you might encounter the getHashCode() method. This method is an integral part of the object class, allowing objects to produce a hash code, which is a sequence of numbers that computably represents the object. You may wonder if this hash code can uniquely identify an item like a picture or a song on your device. In this article, we will delve into what a hash code is and how getHashCode() works within the context of C#.\nWhat is a Hash Code?\nA hash code is a numerical value produced by a hash function, which maps data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, usually for efficient data retrieval.

That’s exactly why I created this BMI Calculator — to help people like you and me get a quick snapshot of where we stand.\nBMI stands for Body Mass Index. It’s a quick and easy way to check if your weight is in a healthy range for your height. While it’s not a perfect measure (it doesn’t account for muscle mass or body composition), it gives a general idea of whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.\nKnowing your BMI can help you:\nUnderstand your general health\nSet personal fitness or wellness goals\nStart conversations with your healthcare provider\nStay motivated in your weight journey\nAnd the best part? It only takes a few seconds.\nUsing the calculator is super simple:\nEnter your height and weight\n\nClick the Calculate button\nInstantly get your BMI score and category\nNo signups. No fuss. Just useful info.\n✅ Fast and accurate results\n✅ Works on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)\n✅ User-friendly interface\n✅ Helpful health tips included\n✅ No personal data required\nHere’s a quick breakdown of BMI categories:\nBelow 18.5 → Underweight\n\n\n18.5 – 24.9 → Normal weight\n\n\n25 – 29.9 → Overweight\n\n\n30 and above → Obese\n\n\n\nRemember: BMI is just one tool. It's always best to consult a doctor for a full health picture.\nI created this tool because I wanted something fast, simple, and useful. I didn’t want to download an app or create an account just to get a number. So I built it — and now I’m sharing it with you, free of charge.\n👉 Click here to use the BMI Calculator\nIt’s totally free and might be the first step to a healthier you.\n✨ Pro Tip: Bookmark the page so you can check back anytime!\nLet me know what you think or if you'd like to see additional features.

The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.\nIn total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.\nCyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.\nThe attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.\n“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.\nSource: Cyvers Alerts\nRelated: Bybit hacker launders 100% of stolen $1.4B crypto in 10 days\nCrypto losses near $360 million in April \nIn April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. \nApril’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. \nOn April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC.

          "description": "A group of Democratic senators has reportedly sent a letter to leadership at the US Department of Justice and the Treasury Department expressing concerns about US President Donald Trump’s ties to cryptocurrency exchange Binance and potential conflicts of interest in regulating the industry. \nAccording to a May 9 Bloomberg report, Democratic senators asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to report on the steps Binance had taken as part of its November 2023 plea agreement with US authorities, amid reports that Trump and his family had deepened connections with the exchange. \nThat settlement saw Binance pay more than $4 billion as part of a deal with the Justice Department, Treasury, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and had then-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao…",
