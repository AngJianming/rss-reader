Over the years, Brunelle has photographed more than 250 such pairs in 32 cities around the world.\nBut how does facial recognition technology see these ‚Äútwins‚Äù? We decided to find out.\nWe ran several of Brunelle‚Äôs look-alike portraits through our online facial recognition demo.\nThe result?

This is where Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) comes in‚Äîa fully managed Kubernetes service offered by AWS that simplifies cluster management while providing scalability, security, and high availability out of the box.\nüîß What is EKS?\n\nAmazon EKS is AWS's managed Kubernetes service.
