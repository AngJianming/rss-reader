Instead of exporting a router through the Spin SDK, we let users pick and choose their preferred router. In this post, we’ll explore how to use the Hono Router to build full-fledged HTTP APIs with Spin and TypeScript.\nThe Hono Router is a fast, lightweight routing system designed for handling HTTP requests efficiently.
