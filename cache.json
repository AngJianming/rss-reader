Realistically, work takes up so much time that I barely have any quiet moments to really focus on learning. But I also can’t just give up on my current job.\nThe only thing I can think of doing: Even if it’s not directly related to a career change, I’ll try to treat my work as a learning opportunity.

          "description": "Intro:\n\n\nIf you've ever had to debug a macOS app for someone who isn't technical, you already know the pain. Screen sharing over Zoom, walking them through terminal commands, waiting for them to grant permissions—it makes you question your life choices.\nI recently had to troubleshoot a misbehaving background service on a remote MacBook, while the user was 4 time zones away and barely spoke English. Here's how I pulled it off… without a single back-and-forth message.\nThe Mac was already enrolled in our MDM, and we’d pre-approved all the privacy permissions needed (screen recording, input, accessibility, full disk access). That meant one thing: I could take over without asking the user to do anything.\nI used Scalefusion’s Remote access for mac feature to do this. It’s basically a remote desktop for Mac that respects Apple’s privacy rules and MDM permissions.\nLogged into the dashboard\nSelected the MacBook \nClicked Remote Control\nWithin seconds, I was inside the device—screen, keyboard, mouse, everything.\nNo approval popup, no waiting. I opened Console, inspected launch agents, killed and restarted a background process, and even deployed a patch script—live.\nMost developers building internal apps or managing remote teams don't want to maintain a full-blown Mac management stack. But the reality is that once your app is deployed in the wild, you will get bug reports, and remote debugging becomes a support issue.\nThis approach—leveraging MDM + remote access—gives you surgical access to fix things fast, securely, and with minimal friction.\nA macOS device enrolled in Mac MDM (preferably via Apple Business Manager)\nPre-configured PPPC profiles (yes, these matter)\nRemote Access tools like Scalefusion that respect Apple's TCC model\nA clear policy that balances control and user privacy\nIf you're a dev or IT admin supporting Mac users, modern MDM-powered remote access is the way forward. You’ll spend less time chasing screenshots and more time fixing things.",

But before you sign any contracts, there are some crucial things to consider. Let me walk you through what to watch for when hiring BI services.\nBefore reaching out to providers, get crystal clear on what you're trying to achieve. Are you looking to improve your decision-making speed? Uncover hidden market opportunities? A better understanding of customer behavior? The more specific you are about your goals, the better your BI partner can tailor their approach to deliver what you truly need.\nGreat BI professionals should be fluent in the tools of the trade. Look for demonstrated experience with SQL, Tableau, Power BI, or other analytics platforms relevant to your business. Ask potential partners about their technical capabilities and how they've solved similar problems for other clients.\nBeyond technical skills, strong analytical reasoning is crucial. Your ideal BI partner should show a knack for turning complex data into meaningful insights. During interviews, present them with a typical business challenge and see how they approach breaking it down.\nA BI consultant who understands your industry's unique challenges can hit the ground running. They'll know which metrics matter most and can benchmark your performance against relevant standards. This domain expertise saves time and improves the quality of insights.\nEven brilliant analysis is worthless if no one understands it. Your BI partner should translate technical findings into clear, actionable recommendations that everyone, from executives to frontline managers, can grasp and implement.\nYour business data is precious. Verify that potential partners follow robust security practices and will protect your sensitive information.",

          "description": "Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail \nOn paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.\nAnd yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?\nThe harsh reality is that decentralized social networks hav…",

It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.\nLaunched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. \nWhen a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …",

          "description": "Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. \nWith over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.\n“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states. \n“This will allow World Liberty Financial to validate the technical functionality of its airdrop system in a live environmen…",
