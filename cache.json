Traditionally, animators have painstakingly brought these visions to life frame by frame. Today, an innovative collaborator enters the scene—not to replace the artist, but to empower them. Artificial intelligence (AI) joins forces with animators, reshaping how stories are crafted and enriching creative expression in unprecedented ways.\nThis partnership heralds a moment of transition, filled with optimism yet tempered by caution. Yet ultimately, both animator and technology stand poised to explore possibilities once unimaginable, redefining the boundaries of storytelling itself.\nIn animation, creativity often collides with monotony.

          "description": "Engineering is more than formulas, projects, or classroom lectures. While academic learning builds a foundation, real-world experience shapes your mindset, communication, and decision-making abilities. From my own journey, I’ve seen how industrial training, leadership roles, and volunteering helped me grow far beyond the textbook.\nWhen you work in a real production environment, like a garment factory, you begin to understand how things actually work on the floor. Industrial training teaches you about time management, coordination, and how teams solve problems in real-time. You observe how small improvements in workflow or communication can bring large results. This kind of learning is something no classroom can fully teach.\nLeadership roles in university also help in developing essential soft skills. Organizing events, managing volunteers, and communicating under pressure make you more confident and responsible. It teaches you how to plan, lead, and adapt — which are valuable qualities in both academic and professional life.\nVolunteering adds another layer to your development. It allows you to give back to your community while also learning empathy, teamwork, and people skills. Volunteering shows that you are proactive and socially responsible, which employers and organizations appreciate.\nThese experiences make your resume stronger, but more importantly, they shape your personality. They prepare you for interviews, teamwork, and real challenges in your career. You learn how to think practically, solve problems, and communicate your ideas clearly — all of which are essential in today’s job market.\nIf you are an engineering student, try to step outside your comfort zone. Look for internships, attend workshops, join a leadership program, or take part in a volunteering activity. The real world is the best teacher, and the lessons you learn there will stay with you forever.\nStart early, stay curious, and take every opportunity to grow.",

          "description": "Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.\nDrake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”\nDrake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. \nIn the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”\nHummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…",
