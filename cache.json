          "description": "Event listeners are a fundamental part of interactive web development. They allow your JavaScript code to respond to user actions, such as clicks, keyboard input, or page loading. In this post, we'll explore what event listeners are, the different types, and how to use them effectively.  \nWhat Are Event Listeners?\n\n\nAn event listener is a function that waits for a specific event (like a click or keypress) to occur on a DOM element. When the event happens, the listener executes a callback function, enabling dynamic and interactive behavior.  \nCommon Types of Events\n\n\nHere are some frequently used events in JavaScript:  \nMouse Events  \nclick ‚Äì When an element is clicked.\n\n\nmouseover / mouseout ‚Äì When the mouse enters or leaves an element.\n\n\nmousedown / mouseup ‚Äì When a mouse button is presse‚Ä¶",
