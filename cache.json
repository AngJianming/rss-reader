We'll dive deep into why this might be happening and how to effectively address it.\nUnderstanding ZK-Proofs and snarkjs\n\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow one party to prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself.

The main advantage of using them is the ability to delegate the data handling logic to a dedicated class, keeping controllers and models leaner.\nImagine you need to perform an action every time a user is created. Instead of writing that logic directly in the controller or the model, you can use an Observer to ensure that the logic is isolated and easier to test.\nCreating an Observer in Laravel is very simple. Let's take a look at a basic example of an Observer for a User model:\nphp artisan make:observer UserObserver --model=User\n\nOpen the App\\Providers\\EventServiceProvider file and register the observer:\npublic function boot()\n{\n   ‚Ä¶",
