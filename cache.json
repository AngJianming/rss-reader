          "description": "深入理解Hyperlane的中间件系统：一个大三学生的实践笔记\n\n\n作为一名大三计算机专业的学生，我在使用 Hyperlane 框架开发校园项目的过程中，对其中间件系统有了深入的理解。今天，我想分享一下我在实践中的心得体会。\ngraph TD\n    A[客户端请求] --> B[认证中间件]\n    B --> C[日志中间件]\n    C --> D[控制器]\n\nHyperlane 的中间件采用洋葱模型，请求从外层向内层传递，这种设计让请求处理流程清晰可控。\nasync fn request_middleware(ctx: Context) {\n    let socket_addr = ctx.get_socket_addr_or_default_string().await;\n    ctx.set_response_header(SERVER, HYPERLANE)\n        .await\n        .set_response_header(\"SocketAddr\", socket_addr)\n        .await;\n}\n\n相比其他框架需要通过 trait 或层注册中间件，Hyperlane 直接使用异步函数注册，更加直观。\nasync fn auth_middleware(ctx: Context) {\n    let token = ctx.get_request_header(\"Authorization\").await;\n    match token {\n        Some(token) => {\n            // 验证逻辑\n            ctx.set_request_data(\"user_id\", \"123\").await;\n        }\n        None => {\n           …",
