It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, making it an excellent tool for chatbots, content creation, and other applications that require natural language processing. In this post, we will explore the workings of ChatGPT to understand how it generates human-like text.\nThe backbone of ChatGPT is a transformer-based neural network that has been trained on a massive amount of text data.

Somethings which would be as easy as hello world in some other language or runtime - it would be near impossible to implement in node js espically due to it's single threaded nature. Go on the other hand comes with built in support for multithreading.\nI had been tackling an issue where I needed to synchronize my database with a CRM database which had strict limit on how many API requests I could make per 5 secs. I tried everything from shifting framework (Node to Nest), tried using event driven architecture with REDIS as transport, and tried using BullMQ. But nothing worked; I needed my application to run 24/7 and keep data in sync - node just couldn't do it. It lacks alot in this domain due to it's internal acrhecture. \n\nGo on other hand had shined here - it came with built in support for background jobs running on multiple threads. I could make 100s to 1000s of background jobs using go routines on same machine where I could barely run 3 or 4 in node js. Go allowed me to run the application 24/7 without any downtime - yes I mean any. Not once was heap memory full or some other internal issue. \nBut even go had it's downside. Not a lot of community support espically in niched areas. I had to build a lot of stuff which is easy to implement in node js by installing third party libraries. \nif anyone has worked or is working on API polling database's, or similar task - I would love to connect with you",

Here's a quick and reliable way to migrate your entire setup — in just a few simple steps.\nWe’ll copy all SafeLine WAF data from your current environment (let's call it Env1) to a new environment (Env2) that will take over.\nMake sure both Env1 and Env2 are running the same version of SafeLine.\n\nIf Env1 is outdated, upgrade it before migration.\nEnsure SafeLine is properly installed in both environments.\n\nTip: You can check the SafeLine version by logging into the admin panel or inspecting the installation directory.\nStop the SafeLine containers on both environments.\n# Run this in the SafeLine install directory\ndocker compose down\n\nDo this on both Env1 and Env2.\nEnv1\n\nEnv2\n\nsafeline Data Directory\n\n\nFrom Env1, compress the entire safeline directory:\napt install zip     # Install zip if it's not available\ncd /data\nzip -r safeline.zip safeline\n\n\n\nThen transfer the zip file to Env2 using scp:\nscp safeline.zip root@<Env2-IP>:/data\n\n\nOn Env2, unzip and replace the existing safeline directory:\ncd /data\nrm -rf safeline               # Remove old data\nunzip safeline.zip            # Extract the migrated data\n\n\nOn Env2, navigate into the SafeLine directory and restart the WAF:\ncd /data/safeline\ndocker compose up -d\n\n\nOnce it's running, log in to confirm:\n\n✅ All your original configurations, rules, and logs should now be present on Env2.\nTest a few features to make sure everything works as expected.\n\nIf all looks good — migration is done!\nThis method is fast, doesn't require downtime beyond a restart, and keeps your full configuration intact. Perfect for server upgrades, environment cloning, or disaster recovery setups.\nGitHub Repository\n\n\nOfficial Docs\n\nDiscord Community",
