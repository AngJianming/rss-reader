          "description": "Take-Two and EA have quietly slipped AI warnings into their latest 10-K filings, flagging that using generative AI in game development could spark ‚Äúsocial and ethical issues,‚Äù lead to legal headaches and even erode fan trust. They‚Äôre doing it because public companies must list any material risk‚Äîfrom hurricanes to worker strikes‚Äîso investors know what could go sideways.\nIndustry watchers like Niko Partners‚Äô Daniel Ahmad point out that nearly every big studio (yes, even Nintendo) is experimenting with AI, mostly at the concept stage. Take-Two‚Äôs boss Strauss Zelnick says these tools will boost efficiency but never replace human creativity, while EA and Microsoft foresee short-term layoffs followed by long-term job growth. Both giants have recently cut hundreds of positions, though it‚Äôs unclear how much AI played a role.",

To enable transformations, you can change the element's display property to inline-block or use layout modes like Grid or Flexbox.\nThe transition property is a vital aspect of CSS animations, allowing for smooth transitions between states of an element.
