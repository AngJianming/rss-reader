It started out as an SDK on Guthub, but now its has become a cloud based API. AI has helped put it on the map for data extraction.\nIn an era where customer retention is more valuable than ever, loyalty rewards programs have become a cornerstone strategy for businesses looking to build lasting relationships. At the heart of many of these programs lies receipt scanning ‚Äî a process that must be accurate, fast, and scalable to provide a seamless user experience.

          "description": "Everyone probably has a different definition, and depending on your perspective, the answer can vary. For influencers who use new AI features as part of their content, even if it has little to no practical value in the industry, the entertainment value alone can make it worthwhile.\nBut for professionals who have been working for years and are actually applying AI in their jobs, these things are essentially just advertising. It‚Äôs not that they have no value‚Äîit‚Äôs just a different perspective.\nTo me, even though the IT industry evolves rapidly, the things that fundamentally don‚Äôt change are what truly hold value.\nFor example:\nShould we use AI to learn and improve work efficiency, or just dive into vibe coding, abandoning all the details‚Äîlike information security‚Äîand risk lawsuits and other consequences?\nTruly valuable things always take time to learn and apply. They need to be internalized and become part of you, enabling you to solve real-world problems‚Äînot just show short-term, surface-level results.\nIn other words, the essence of AI is to raise everyone‚Äôs baseline capabilities, reduce repetitive tasks, and free up our attention for areas that are more meaningful. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äîor should‚Äîcompletely replace humans.\nRather than focusing solely on prompt engineering, we should prioritize communication and expression skills.\nLately, I‚Äôve been spending less time on social media to reduce meaningless anxiety. It's better to invest that time in exploring tools that are actually useful and learning how to use them effectively.",
