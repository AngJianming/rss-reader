          "description": "First of all, what is it like to have tinnitus? I would say, in short, it sucks. It’s a piece of quality of life that has been lost and you never experience absolute silence again.\nCan you live with it? Yes!\nCan you work as a software developer with it? Yes, of course!\nBut it has to be said, a constant, persistent beep is a distraction, especially when a deep focus on a task is needed.\nI would like to make a few points about how I deal with this, especially when developing software.\nThe first (perhaps most important for me) step in dealing with this was acceptance. In the beginning I felt shame, anger and even fear. However, with the acceptance of this new fact, it got better and my head was clearer again.\nI looked for nice, relaxing sounds and played them in the background. The beeping is always there, so why not cover it up with something beautiful that you like and brings you joy, I thought to myself. There are countless playlists for all kinds of sounds on the streaming platforms, such as nature and night rain.\nI take regular breaks and rest my body and mind during this time. In my opinion, a working day, however stressful it may be, should have at least one longer lunch break with fresh air (I’m still working on this). Nevertheless, the lunch break is an integral part of every situation where I don’t think about work for 30 minutes and recharge my batteries.\nI have already set up my workstation ergonomically. Of course, there’s always room for more. A desk that can be raised and lowered is a great thing. Correct posture is extremely important. I’m still at the beginning in this area and am always looking at where I can improve.\nOk ok I know, admittedly sounds, pauses and ergonomics aren’t big new pro tips. I would rather like to say that this impairment loses its power when you exhaust all other possibilities and start optimizing. You should concentrate on the things you can influence and make the best of them!",

          "description": "In cache design, we often encounter a troublesome problem: a large number of “invalid queries” put tremendous pressure on the database. For example, when a user requests data that doesn’t exist, we typically query the database, which returns “not found.” If there are many such requests, the database gets busy handling these meaningless queries, affecting system performance. So, is there a way to know in advance whether data “might exist” before querying? This is where Bloom filters come into play.\nImagine the following scenario:\nOur system has a cache layer (Redis) and a database layer (MySQL).\nWhen a user requests some data, we first check the cache. If it’s a cache hit, we return the result directly.\nIf the data isn’t in the cache, we query the database. If the database doesn’t have it e…",

          "description": "In today’s fast-paced software development world, having a trusty coding assistant can make all the difference. Local AI models are gaining traction because they provide quick, offline support while keeping your data secure. Enter Msty, your go-to tool for seamlessly integrating local AI models into your coding workflow.\nMsty makes it easy to leverage powerful local models like DeepSeek, Mistral, and Gemma. Here’s how to get started:\nInstall Msty: Download Msty App and set it up on your machine or use Msty Studio for a web-based experience.\nIntegrate with VS Code: Choose between using Copilot or the Roo Code extension, both are available in Visual Studio Code.\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Copilot is like having a coding partner right by your side. To connect it to your local models:\nOpen Settings in VS Code: Click the gear icon in the bottom left corner and select \"Settings.\"\nSet Up Your API Provider: Find \"Bring Your Own Key\" in settings for Ollama and enter the local model endpoint from Msty.\nChoose Your Model: Go to \"Manage Models,\" select your desired local model, and you’re ready to go!\nWith Copilot, you can ask questions directly in your code editor, making your coding life much easier.\n\n\n\n\nLooking for more customization? Try Roo Code, an open-source extension that allows for advanced model fine-tuning. Here’s how to set it up:\nInstall Roo Code: Search for \"Roo\" in the VS Code extensions tab and install it.\nCreate a Profile: Open Roo Code, click the plus icon, and name setup a new profile (like \"Msty\").\nConnect Your Models: Use the endpoint from Msty, select Ollama as the API provider, and then enter the local model endpoint from Msty to link up your local models.\nRoo Code offers customizable settings that let you tailor your coding assistant to fit your needs.\nUsing local AI models is a game-changer for developers. With Msty simplifying the process, you can easily integrate tools like GitHub Copilot and Roo Code into your workflow. Dive in, explore these options, and elevate your coding experience with local AI assistance!",
