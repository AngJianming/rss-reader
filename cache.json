Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.\nConsider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:\nChange the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.\nExample:\n\n\nInput: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3\n,]\nclass Solution {\n    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {\n        int i, j;\n        int k = 0;\n\n        Arrays.sort(nums);\n\n        for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n            if (nums[i] == val) {…",

Users were complaining that downloaded files from our document management system were \"corrupted\" and wouldn't open. The twist? The files were perfectly fine in our AWS S3 bucket.\nPicture this: You're building an application where users upload important kyc documents—driver's licenses, bank statements, tax documents. Everything seems to work perfectly during testing. Files upload fine, they're stored securely in S3, and when you download them through your admin panel, they open without issues.\nThen the support tickets start rolling…",

          "description": "These days, the hype around vibe coding feels limitless. Tools that promise to turn your ideas into apps with nothing more than a chat prompt are everywhere. But back in March this year, I came across a tweet from a developer who discovered that one of those tools, Lovable, was exposing a user's Supabase API key. While it was a publishable API key, it had no permissions or restrictions, and the developer was able to access all the app's data without authentication, just by looking at the public build.\nThis is not innovation. This is a security breach waiting to happen.\n\nThis is what happens when people lean too hard on the vibe. They build software by instinct, skip fundamentals, and trust that the tool knows best.

By this point, they’re likely already interested in your offering and are evaluating pricing models before making a purchase decision. \nThat’s why your pricing page layout plays a critical role in communicating your plans and guiding users toward the right plan for their needs. But what exactly makes a SaaS pricing page effective?\nInterestingly, most SaaS pricing pages tend to follow a similar structure. This isn’t by accident, which is explained by Jakob’s Law: Users prefer familiar experiences. When your pricing page resembles layouts they’ve seen before, it builds trust and reduces friction.
