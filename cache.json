Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nSource: John Karony\nKarony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform‚Äôs creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly ‚Äúdiverted and misappropriated millions of dollars‚Äô worth‚Äù of SafeMoon‚Äôs SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.\nRelated: SEC charges Unicoin crypto platform over alleged $100 million fraud\n\nLatest in a line of crypto execs facing criminal charges\nAt the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.\nKarony‚Äôs trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea.
