Whether you're building a high-performance computing system, managing enterprise workloads, or just experimenting with microservices, you‚Äôll likely encounter three key deployment models: bare metal, virtual machines (VMs), and containers.\nEach comes with its own trade-offs in terms of performance, flexibility, and isolation. Let‚Äôs break down what each approach offers and when you might choose one over the others.\nBare metal refers to running applications directly on physical hardware without any virtualization layer in between.\nMaximum performance: No overhead from virtualization or shared resources.\nFull control: Direct access to hardware resources like CPU, memory, and storage.\nLow flexibility: Difficult to scale dynamica‚Ä¶",

This is similar to how DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.\nThis should help Web3 users own a domain and send/receive transactions.\nBut, there are adoption challenges.\nExamples:\nENS\nUnstoppable Domains\nSolana Name Service\nHandshake\nTezos Domains\nEach service resolves domains only within a set of networks but not in others.\nThis is bad because...\nUsers need to register their domain at each network\nDomains can collide with each other\nThey use the default DNS servers of the operating system or the browser.\nThe only partial exception is Brave, which resolves some domains (e.g. .crypto, and .eth)\nWhile you can set up a custom Web3 DNS resolver, you cannot expect every visitor of your Web3 domain to do the same.\nUnstoppable Domains kills .coin in the name of .wallet (2022): https://domainnamewire.com/2022/10/18/unstoppable-domains-kills-coin-in-the-name-of-wallet/\n\nWhat is ENS?: https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900404-what-is-ens\n\nAbout Handshake: https://learn.namebase.io/about-handshake/about-handshake\n\nUnderstanding DNS, Onchain & Web3 Domains (2025): https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/education/article/understanding-dns-onchain-web3-domains\n\nBrave Becomes First Browser to Launch On‚ÄëChain Naming Service, Unlocking .brave for Over 85M Users (2025): https://brave.com/blog/brave-tld/",

          "description": "In a NoSQL database, data structure varies based on requirements. In a List, data is stored in a specific order, and the position of each element matters. For example, to access the first element in a List, you retrieve the value at index 0, which is predictable due to the ordered nature of Lists.\nHowever, when the order of data is not important, a Dictionary (or key-value store) is more suitable. Consider a scenario where you need to store user information like age, address, first name, and last name. In this case, the sequence of these fields doesn‚Äôt matter. With a Dictionary, you can directly access a specific value using its key, such as retrieving the first name by querying the \"first_name\" key, without needing to know the last name or other fields.\nKey differences:\nIn a List, values are stored with predefined, sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...), and you access data by its position.\nIn a Dictionary, you define custom keys mapped to values, allowing direct access to data via the key, regardless of order.\nThus, for scenarios where you need flexible, key-based access to data without relying on order, a Dictionary is the preferred choice.\nCoffee Menu in Python ‚Äî Dictionary Operations\nCreating a Coffee Menu (Dictionary)\nprint(coffee_menu)\nAccessing a Value (Using Key)\nprint(coffee_menu['Espresso'])\nOutput:\nBold shot!\nChanging a Value\n\ncoffee_menu['Espresso'] = 'Tiny Thunder'\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nIterating Over the Dictionary\nOnly Keys\nOutput:\nKeys and Values (Method 1)\nKeys and Values (Method 2)\nAdding an Item\nRemoving Items\n\n\n\n\nUsing pop(key)\n\ncoffee_menu.pop('Espresso')\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nUsing popitem()\nRemoves the last inserted item.\nExample Output:\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If the dictionary is empty, popitem() will raise a KeyError.\nUsing del Statement\n\ndel coffee_menu[\"Latte\"]\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nüìù Note:\nEach operation was done individually for demonstration, so dictionary contents might look different in each output.
