This quick guide shows you how to combine three awesome Python libraries to do just that:\npyfiglet ‚Äî for eye-catching ASCII text banners.\nWhy Care About Terminal Styling?\nWhen building CLI tools or scripts, output styling helps:\nCode Example\nimport pyfiglet\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom rich.console import Console\nfrom rich.progress import track\nimport time\n\n# ---------- 1. ASCII Art ----------\nascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format(\"Nishkarsh!\")\nprint(ascii_banner)\n\n# ---------- 2. TQDM Progress Bar ----------\nprint(\"\\n[1] Loading with tqdm:\")\nfor _ in tqdm(range(50), desc=\"Loading...\"):\n    time.sleep(0.02)\n\n# ---------- 3. Rich Progress Bar ----------\nconsole = Console()\nprint(\"\\n[2] Fancy Progress with Rich:\")\nfor step in track(range(10), description=\"Processing tasks...\"):\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n\n# ---------- 4. Rich Spinner / Status ----------\nprint(\"\\n[3] Animated Spinner with Rich:\")\nwith console.status(\"[bold green]Finalizing magic...\"):\n    time.sleep(2)\n\nconsole.print(\"\\n[bold cyan]All done! Your terminal is now beautiful. üåà[/bold cyan]\")\n\n\nOutput:\n\nWhat Happens Here?\ntqdm shows a simple progress bar with a label \"Loading...\" that fills up as the loop runs.\nrich‚Äôs track() gives a colorful, animated progress bar with the label \"Processing tasks...\".\nrich also lets you create a spinner with a status message (Finalizing magic...) to show a task in progress.\nFinally, it prints a colored success message with emoji to celebrate!\nHow to Run This\npip install pyfiglet tqdm rich\n\n\nSave the script as terminal_magic.py\npython terminal_magic.py\n\n\nWhat Else Can You Do?\nCombine rich‚Äôs tables, trees, and markdown for killer CLI apps.\nFinal Thoughts\nAdding some style to your terminal output is easier than you think ‚Äî and it makes your tools so much nicer to use. Give these libraries a try and watch your command line come alive!",
