          "description": "Software Engineering is not (only) about money\n\n\nA lot of people jump into coding because they think it's a good way to make a lot of money. Either by working for big tech or by building the next $1 million app. Maybe you come from a third world country and want to support your family, and I respect that.\nEverything used to be better. Fewer problems, better and friendlier people, better music, more money etc.\nThere were no shortcuts. You couldn't just throw more RAM or more power at it. You had fixed circumstances and it was about how you used them. Pokemon Red and Blue were 373 KB. Legendary games to this day, more than enough content, polished and soooo much fun. Nowadays every fooking Call of Duty update is multiple GBs!\nThe result is that software is getting worse and worse and has been for decades. Web development is a big pile of abstractions and Javascript is everywhere. Bugs are already considered normal. ‚ÄúYou can fix them later anyway.‚Äù\nI love software engineering. I love learning new things, I love looking under the hood. To understand how things work. Valuing resources and not following the mantra ‚Äúmake it work somehow‚Äù.\nThat doesn't mean you should lose yourself in perfectionism.\nWhat I want to say:\nHardware is getting better and better. Faster and faster. Smaller and smaller. We are at a point where hardware is getting better and better and software is getting worse and worse.\nIn a world where ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù is becoming more and more popular, it is all the more important that we take our craft seriously and do it with love. Our world is built on software. Make software great again!",
