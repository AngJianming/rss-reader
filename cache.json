Its impact is both groundbreaking and complex—offering unprecedented productivity boosts while introducing new challenges that developers must navigate thoughtfully.\nThe Positive Side: Supercharged Productivity and Innovation\nFor startups and solo developers, AI lowers the barrier to entry, allowing smaller teams to build powerful applications that would have previously required large development resources. It's also enabling innovation in fields like healthcare, education, and finance by automating complex data analysis and modeling tasks.\nThe Negative Side: Dependency and Ethical Dilemmas\nEthically, concerns around data privacy, model bias, and job displacement must be addressed. As AI takes over more tasks, companies must ensure that developers are not just users but also ethical stewards of these powerful tools.\nConclusion\n@alx_africa",

The remarkable growth of JavaScript hinges on the efficiency and speed of its engines, such as V8 (Chrome, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari). This article delves into JavaScript's engine optimizations, exploring historical and technical contexts, performance considerations, potential pitfalls, and advanced debugging techniques.\nJavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995.

I kept hearing things like:\n“This isn’t that much code, but it touches three different systems.”\n“We don’t even know if that API does what we need yet.”\n“I can knock this out fast, but I’ll need Jack to unblock me.”\n“Feels simple, but every time we touch that part of the code, something breaks.”\n…",

By allowing users to narrow down what they see based on specific criteria, you improve both usability and performance.\nUse cases include:\nMarketplaces (filter by category, price, etc.)\nDashboards (filter by date, status, owner)\nCRMs (filter by name, stage, priority)\nIn this tutorial, I cover:\nSetting up a basic repeating group\n\nAdding filters with input fields and dropdowns\n\nChaining multiple filter conditions\n\nBest practices for responsiveness and performance\n\nReal-world example: filtering a product or transaction list\nAlways double-check your search constraints inside the repeating group’s data source.\nUse \"Ignore empty constraints\" to make filters optional.\nCombine multiple inputs using \"Do a Search for\" + Advanced filters when needed.\nBubble.io Documentation on Repeating Groups\nBubble Forum – Filtering Use Cases\nIf you found this helpful, don’t forget to:\nLike & subscribe on YouTube for more no-code tutorials\nLeave a comment with your questions or tutorial requests\nShare this with someone building in Bubble!\n📺 Watch Now:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  🔖 Tags\n\n\n#Bubbleio #NoCode #BubbleTips #BubbleTutorial #Filtering #RepeatingGroups #WebAppDevelopment #NoCodeDevelopment",

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.\nThe company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.\nThe product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility whil…",

According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. \nMeanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.\nFrom a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:\n\n…",
