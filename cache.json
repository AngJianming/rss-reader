          "description": "AI projects face security challenges resulting from difficulties in ensuring model integrity and reliability. The Sleepy Pickle and HuggingFace models' silent backdoors are notable examples of such model security loopholes. \nAI project components comprise data, models, and code. Modifying the data or code often allows for the change of the model component without a trace. Thorough documentation of the creation, operation, and lifecycle of your model’s dependencies, processes, metadata, artifacts, tools, libraries, etc. enables you to protect your AI system from common model breaches like data or model poisoning, model evasion, confidentiality attacks, and model flaws.\nModel attestation, similar to a traditional software attestation security strategy, is a practice that enables you to establish a verifiable security supply chain for all system components. It is a strategy that verifies the integrity, authenticity, and lifecycle of your model's data, code, and artifacts and their relationship at the different stages of the development lifecycle.\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOMs) or AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), in the context of AI projects, is an inventory report you can use for model attestation. It provides an inventory of the components and the dependencies used in building a model. This inventory report should typically include data, model artifacts, dependencies, and their relationships.\nTo know more about the topic and the tools that will help in tackling these problems of AI security, check out this full blog by Jozu.",

          "description": "Introduction\nIn the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), evaluating the quality of generated images is a crucial task. One popular metric for this evaluation is the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score, which typically requires images with three color channels (RGB). However, if you're working with single-channel images like those found in the MNIST dataset, this may pose a challenge. In this article, we'll explore how to handle single-channel images and compute the FID score effectively.\nUnderstanding FID Score\nThe FID score is a statistical distance between the distribution of generated images and the distribution of real images. It uses the activations of a pre-trained Inception model as a feature representation of the images. Under normal circumstances, this model expects…",
