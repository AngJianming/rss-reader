          "description": "Hey everyone!\nI’m currently doing some research into how developers and DevOps teams handle application security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC) — from design to deployment.\nThe goal is to better understand what real-world teams are doing when it comes to:\nSecurity Across These Phases:\nDesign phase (do you do threat modeling?)\n\n\nDevelopment/code review (do you run SAST? Get auto-fix suggestions?)\n\n\nTesting phase (any dynamic/DAST tools, custom logic testing?)\n\n\nDeployment phase (cloud config checks, misconfig detection?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I’d Love to Learn:\nHow do you currently integrate security into your SDLC?\nDo security tools slow you down or help you move faster?\nDo you actually use the auto-fix/code suggestions from tools?\nWhat’s the most frustrating thing about your current AppSec setup?\nWhy I’m Asking:\nI'm exploring smarter ways to automate and simplify security across the SDLC — especially for teams without full-time AppSec engineers.\nBut rather than guess, I want to hear how you work:\nWhat’s working?\nWhat’s missing?\nWhat would make AppSec feel less like a chore?\nDrop a comment below, or DM me if you're open to a short async chat.\nThanks for sharing your experience",

          "description": "Cloud resource management is increasingly vital as companies scale their operations in the digital age. Leveraging the right cloud cost management tools has become essential for finance leaders to optimize cloud spend and ensure efficiency. Traditional resource management strategies often fail to align with the dynamic, usage-based nature of cloud services, requiring a more agile and strategic approach to maintain control over costs.\nFor years, businesses operated on fixed-resource models, purchasing hardware and infrastructure with predictable, long-term lifespans. The approach was straightforward: once assets were acquired, they were depreciated over time, and financial planning followed a fixed pattern. However, the cloud has disrupted this model by offering on-demand resources that flu…",
