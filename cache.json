Let me try a different approach to debug this…”\nLet’s talk about the latest ripple making waves across the tech pond. You probably caught the buzz last week when Shopify’s CEO, Tobi Lütke, dropped an internal memo that basically set a new baseline: using AI isn’t just encouraged anymore, it’s practically expected. The memo even suggested teams need to justify not using AI before asking for more resources or headcount. Forbes quickly jumped on this, slapping a catchy (and maybe slightly terrifying?) “Hire AI, Not Humans” headline on it.\nNow, before we dive deep, let’s be clear: this isn’t another think piece about the grand future of AGI, whether LLMs will pass the Turing test nex…",

Compared to other popular blockchain networks, we could say that Hooks are like smart contracts in EVM-based networks, but with a completely different philosophy and approach, tailored to Xahau’s technology.\nThe previous article also pointed out the need to add “smart contract” technology to Xahau, since it was not originally available in the XRP Ledger.

If you've recently created a repository on GitHub, initialized it locally using Git, added files, and committed them, yet can’t see your files on GitHub, don’t worry! This guide will help you troubleshoot the problem effectively.\nUnderstanding the Issue\nThe first step in resolving the issue of missing files in your GitHub repository is understanding how Git works.

Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.\nTheir reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).\n\nThe “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. \nBut can quantum computers break Bitcoin?
