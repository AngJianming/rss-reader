          "description": "When working with reactive programming in Kotlin, many developers wonder how to turn traditional push-style APIs, like Files.walkFileTree() from NIO.2, into lazy sequences. This transformation allows for more efficient processing of items as they become available without having to create overhead with background threads. The challenge lies in implementing this transformation in an idiomatic way. In this article, we'll explore how to achieve this using Kotlin's SequenceScope and coroutines.\nUnderstanding the Problem\nReactive APIs often push data to consumers, resulting in the need for the data to be handled asynchronously. The Files.walkFileTree() method is a prime example where a callback-based mechanism informs the application about file visits. While using a background thread and Synchro…",
