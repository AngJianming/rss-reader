From layout mastery to a full personal portfolio — here’s everything I learned and practiced this week:\n📚 Topics I Covered:\n🔹 CSS Positioning\n🔹 CSS Flag Project – The Flag of Laos\n🔹 Advanced CSS\n-> CSS Display: Learned and practiced how elements behave: block, inline, inline-block, and none.\n-> CSS Float: Got a look into how float was used for layouts before Flexbox became standard.\n-> Responsiveness: Learned how to design websites that adapt gracefully to different screens.\n-> Media Queries: Practiced using conditional CSS to target mobile, tablet, and desktop views.\n-> Mini Project – Web Design Agency: Built a small responsive agency website to apply everything.\n🔹 Flexbox\n🔹 CSS Grid\n🔹 Bootstrap\nIt’s like CSS on steroids — great for rapid prototyping.\n🔹 Capstone Project – Personal Portfolio\n🧠 Key Takeaways:\n⚡ Challenges I Faced:\nBootstrap’s class naming took a bit of practice to get used to, but it’s clicking now!\n📌 Projects & Code:\n💬 Let’s Connect!\nWhich layout method do you prefer — Flexbox or Grid?\nDrop your thoughts in the comments or share your layout wins and fails!

Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns.
