          "description": "Throughout my journey with Laravel, I’ve learned a lot of lessons that helped me improve the way I work and write code. Here are 10 key takeaways that made a real difference for me:\nIf you're using Blade, make sure to add required to your HTML fields. If a user submits an empty required field, it shouldn't even reach the server. Save your server from handling unnecessary requests.\nAlways validate incoming data. Avoid using request()->all(), especially if you're using guarded in your model—it could allow unexpected data to slip through.\nresource or apiResource routes\n\n\nThis helps keep your routes organized and prevents your route files from becoming bloated and hard to manage.\nDon't put logic inside your Resource files. It can cause N+1 problems, especially when returning collections. It also makes your code easier for others to understand. Always use pagination for large datasets.\nAvoid N+1 problems by eager loading any relationships you know you'll use. Laravel 12 introduced automatic eager loading, but it's still good practice to manage it explicitly when needed.\nLaravel Logs and tools like Laravel Telescope are great for debugging and monitoring. Just make sure to secure Telescope if you’re using it in production.\nRegularly delete old logs and unused files. For example, when users update profile images, delete the old one. This helps you save disk space in the long run.\nUse Guards, Policies, or Gates to protect your data. Never assume users should have access just because they’re logged in.\nDon’t let a few users flood your system with requests. Throttling is your first line of defense against DDoS attacks.\nUse cache for data that’s accessed frequently and doesn’t change often. It makes a big difference in performance.\nFinal Thought:\n\nYou're building for all kinds of users، always be prepared for the worst-case scenario.",

          "description": "US President Donald Trump has signed a bill criminalizing nonconsensual artificial intelligence-generated deepfake porn, which also requires websites to take down any illicit images within 48 hours.\nTrump signed the bill into law on May 19, known as the TAKE IT DOWN Act, an acronym for Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks.\nThe bill, backed by first lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to publish, or threaten to publish, nonconsensual intimate images, including deepfakes, of adults or minors with the intent to harm or harass them. Penalties range from fines to prison.\nSource: Melania Trump\nWebsites, online services, or apps must remove illegal content within 48 hours and establish a takedown process.\nTrump said in remar…",

          "description": "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.\n“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",
