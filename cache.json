          "description": "Personally I hate FAQs. I think they are a lazy way of presenting content. They are a black hole of information, with zero information scent and no context. \nSo it was really disappointing to find out that AI likes (even prefers) content in that format. A question with an answer. I get that LLMs like tight info relationships, but understanding those relationships in multiple contexts is AI's job. Providing the best smelling info scent is the mission. So why do I need to dumb down my content for AI?\nThere's this thing now called AEO and it's like SEO but for AI models. AI is more likely to surface the content that you write, if it's in a format AI likes to digest. FAQs are like cheese on toast apparently. Delicious and quick to make.\nForgive me if I have higher expectations of our new robot overlords. The content I make is structured, clear, well-expressed, mildly spiced, and made for every palate, human palates especially. \nIf we feed AI the same thing all the time, it's going to regurgitate the same back on us. And is never going to \"learn\" to get its nutrition from variety of foods. So if you see the terms \"AEO\" or \"AIEO\" don't believe the hype.
