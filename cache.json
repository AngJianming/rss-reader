To keep things concise, I’ll assume you’ve reviewed the setup and basics. Let’s dive in.\nSending emails is a common requirement in web applications. PHP has built-in libraries for this, but what if you need to save emails to the Sent folder for tracking? In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to send emails (with or without attachments) and save them using the DotApp PHP framework, leveraging its Emailer library and Email facade.\nCreate a new module called EmailTest by running:\nphp dotapper.php --create-module=EmailTest\n\nIn the app/config.php file, add the SMTP and IMAP configurations for email functionality:\n// SMTP configuration for sending emails\nConf…",

It’s a small interaction, but it makes the UI feel polished and intentional.\nI wanted to figure out how they were doing it.\nCSS handles the stickiness (with position: sticky), but there’s no built-in way to detect when it happens.\nNo CSS selector*. No JavaScript event.\nI love figuring out how to replicate cool interactions I see on the web—so here’s how to do this one using the magical IntersectionObserver API.\nIt’s widely supported, lightweight, and once you know the trick, you’ll start seeing opportunities to use it everywhere.\n🧠 Read the guide:\nhttps://jakeisonline.com/javascript/detecting-sticky-elements\nHave you tried this approach—or come across similar patterns in the wild?\n* Good news: We’ll soon be able to use container queries to detect when an element becomes sticky.\nBut as of this article’s publishing, it’s only available in Chrome, so you’re stuck with this for now",
