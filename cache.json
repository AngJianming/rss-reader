This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens.

Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this.
