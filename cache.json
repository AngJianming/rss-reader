          "description": "There is a lot of misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding Web Components. Many developers do not see their benefit or have misconceptions about what they can and cannot do. This series is intended to debunk those misrepresentations of this massively underappreciated set of tools.\nTo fully master this powerful feature of the web platform one must understand the history and reasoning behind their implementation.\nWeb Components might seem like a recent trend, but their story goes back over the span of decades. Before React, Angular or even jQuery there was a much wilder time. Often referred to as the Wild West of the Web, I see this era more like the age of Feudalism with each browser vendor acting as their own virtual kingdom.\nThrough the 1990s and into the early 2000s, browsers were…",

Around the early 1900s, Japanese and Chinese immigrants created the now-famous cookies, embedding secret messages of wisdom and hope. Like a fortune cookie itself, community resilience in cybersecurity often contains hidden strengths, unexpected yet critical to surviving in a world of uncertainty.\nThis spirit of hidden resilience defined the conversations at BSides San Francisco 2025, showing that in cybersecurity today, emotional intelligence and community trust are not soft skills; they are operational necessities.

At first, you might handle this in a simple, synchronous way: one file at a time, blocking the thread. But this approach doesn't scale well.\nIn this post, we'll explore how to use asynchronous uploads in Java with Spring Boot, why it's a better approach, the trade-offs you need to be aware of, and how to make it more resilient using Resilience4j with retry and exponential backoff.\nLet’s start with a basic implementation using a for loop:\nfor (MultipartFile file : files) {\n    uploadToS3(file);\n}\n\nThis is easy to write, but uploads are sequential and slow — especially if you're uploading many files or large ones. Every file waits for the previous one to finish.\nThis leads to:\nHigher latency\nPoor user exper…",

          "description": "What is a feature phone?\n\n\nFeature phones (aka “dumb phones”) are mobile devices that offer basic features like text messaging and making phone calls. They often go against the modern smartphone form factor, including a set of buttons to navigate the software and a keypad to dial phone numbers. If you were around during the early 2000s, you’ll remember devices such as the Motorola Razr v3 and the LG Chocolate - these are prime examples of what you can roughly expect in a modern feature phone.\nFeature phones are considered less capable devices than modern smartphones, they typically have a small screen, physical keypad, limited internet capabilities, and a few built-in apps.

Bailey said:\n“Traditional finance and Bitcoin-native markets are converging. The securitization of Bitcoin will redraw the world’s economic map. We believe a future is coming where every balance sheet – public or private – holds Bitcoin.”\nLong-term, the firm’s plan includes developing an ecosystem of Bitcoin-native companies, including media, advisory and financial services, all aiming to accelerate Bitcoin adoption and utility. The company resulting from the new merger aims to accumulate Bitcoin and grow the BTC held per share.\nRelated: Trump crypto adviser David Bailey raises $300M for Bitcoin investment firm\nNot the first kid on the block\nMuch like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Nakamoto Holdings plans to leverage equity, debt and other offerings to achieve its objectives. The announcement promises that the company will provide “market exposure to Bitcoin within a compliant, transparent structure.”\nBailey said that Nakamoto Holdings plans to “bring Bitcoin to the center of global capital markets” by integrating it into equity, debt, preferred shares and “new hybrid structures.” He added:\n“Our mission is simple: list these instruments on every major exchange in the world.”\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.\nMagazine: Bitcoiners are ‘all in’ on Trump since Bitcoin ’24, but it’s getting risky",

In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.\nRISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.\nOn April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new sc…",

As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. \nAdvancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.\nAs AI agents increas…",
