          "description": "In the world of software development, documentation often feels like an afterthought – a chore relegated to the end of a sprint, or worse, skipped entirely. Yet, ask any developer about their biggest frustrations, and wading through poor, outdated, or non-existent documentation will invariably rank high. Conversely, encountering clear, concise, and well-structured documentation can feel like finding an oasis in a desert – it accelerates understanding, reduces friction, and ultimately makes the development process more enjoyable and productive.\nThe goal isn't just to have documentation; it's to create documentation that developers genuinely appreciate and use. This means going beyond mere functional descriptions to craft resources that are effective, efficient, and yes, even beautiful. Beau…",

A well-structured architecture ensures flexibility, reduces technical debt, and improves development efficiency.\nMicroservices Architecture breaks an application into small, independently deployable services that communicate via APIs. It's highly scalable and flexible, allowing each service to use different technologies. However, it introduces complexity in deployment and challenges in maintaining data consistency.\nExample: A ProductService and OrderService built as separate ASP.NET Core Web APIs, each with its own database and deployed independently.\nModular Monolith is a single-deployment app…",

The problem isn’t just building projects; the issue is that we build them based on our current, limited understanding. And as the saying goes, “the worst kind of ignorance is thinking you know what you don’t.”\nWhen you create your own projects, you're in control. You decide the architecture, the complexity, and even when to give up. But real-world work doesn’t look like that.

Source: Tether\nAccording to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.\n“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. \nThe company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. \nThe stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. \nEuropean Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”\nMagazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",
