Whether you‚Äôre building a simple to-do app or a large-scale application, following clean code principles will make your life (and your team‚Äôs) much easier.\nHere are some practical tips to help you write clean React code üëá\nüìÅ Organize Your Folder Structure\nStructure your project in a scalable way. Avoid dumping all files in one folder.\nBad:\n/src\n\n\nGood :\n\n\n\n\nüß© Use Functional Components & Hooks\nPrefer functional components with hooks over class components.\n\n\n\n\n// ‚úÖ Clean\nfunction Welcome({ name }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n}\n\nüì¶ Break Components into Smaller Pieces\nKeep components small and focused on one task. If a component is doing too much, break it into smaller ones.\n\n\n\n\n// ‚ùå Bad\nconst Dashboard = () => {\n  // fetching, rendering UI, handling logic... all in one\n};\n\n// ‚úÖ Good\n// Dashboard.jsx ‚Üí uses <UserList />, <StatsPanel />, etc.\n\nüßπ Clean Up useEffect\nAlways clean up side effects to avoid memory leaks.\n\n\n\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const interval = setInterval(() => {\n    console.log(\"Running...\");\n  }, 1000);\n\n  return () => clearInterval(interval); // ‚úÖ cleanup\n}, []);\n\n\nüß™ Write Reusable Hooks\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks.\n\n\n\n\n// useToggle.js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport function useToggle(initialValue = false) {\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const toggle = () => setState(prev => !prev);\n  return [state, toggle];\n}\n\nüöÄ Final Thoughts\nEasy to read üëì\nEasy to reuse ‚ôªÔ∏è\nEasy to test üß™\nEasy to maintain üõ†Ô∏è\nYou don‚Äôt need to be perfect‚Äîjust aim for improvement step by step.

Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.\nSource: John Karony\nKarony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform‚Äôs creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly ‚Äúdiverted and misappropriated millions of dollars‚Äô worth‚Äù of SafeMoon‚Äôs SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.\nThe criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud.

He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.\nKarony‚Äôs trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea.
