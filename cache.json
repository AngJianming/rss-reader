This article will serve as a hands-on guide, walking you through a classic machine learning task: classifying Iris flowers using Python and the powerful scikit-learn library. By the end, you'll have built, trained, and evaluated a simple classification model, gaining a solid foundation for your future AI endeavors.\nThe Iris dataset is a quintessential \"hello world\" for machine learning classification. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. For each flower, four features are measured: sepal length, sepal width,…",

When developers are choosing a library, they deserve to know exactly what they're paying for in terms of bundle impact. That's why, when building neodrag v3, I decided to analyze every single possible plugin combination and report precise bundle sizes for each one.\nThat meant analyzing 2^14 = 16,384 different combinations. Let me walk you through why I went to these lengths and how I tackled this challenge.\nNeodrag is a TypeScript drag-and-drop library that I've been working on for a few years now.
