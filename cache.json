The proposal states that \"AI models released under open-source license without original training data or program\" are not considered DFSG-compliant and thus cannot be included in Debian's \"main\" software repository. This decision aims to uphold Debian's commitment to free and open-source software principles.\nLink\nMeet Your New Terminal Bestie, TmuxAI\n\n\nTired of your terminal feeling like a cold, impersonal void?
