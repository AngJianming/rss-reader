I just never seem to be able to get it the way I want it. Ever since the arrival of the smartphone, websites have had to be responsive and look good on phones but this does not go too well with the type of look I am going for which is a classic late 90s/early 2000s website with a kawaii theme. I am positive I will figure it out with time as long as I keep at it though.\nWhat is the most difficult thing you ever had to code?",

Or just throw a random word out there and hope for the best?\nWhile a first-try guess is pure luck, your starting word is the single most important move you can make. It’s not about guessing the answer; it’s about buying information. A great starting word is a strategic tool that dramatically narrows down the possibilities and sets you on a clear path to that satisfying all-green solution.\nIf you’re ready to move beyond random guesses and approach your daily puzzle like a seasoned strategist, you've come to the right place.
