          "description": "Codex is a cloud-based coding agent created by OpenAI. It can run multiple tasks in parallel to fix bugs, implement features, suggest improvements, and more. It can even create pull requests on platforms like GitHub.\nAlthough Codex already works well with PHP, providing solid code suggestions and improvements, its most powerful feature is that it can run your code (e.g., executing your test suite) to verify that its proposed changes actually work. This is a game-changer for languages like Python or JavaScript, where code execution is supported out of the box.\nPHP, however, is not natively supported for code execution. This article explains how to make Codex work effectively with PHP and Symfony applications, including how to configure it to run your test suite and validate changes automati‚Ä¶",

While these symptoms may be part of OCD, the reality of this complex mental health condition goes far beyond surface-level cleanliness. OCD is a serious and often debilitating disorder that affects millions worldwide, influencing thoughts, behaviors, and daily functioning in profound ways.\nObsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed to reduce the distress caused by these thoughts.
