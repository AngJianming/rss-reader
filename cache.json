          "description": "Introduction: Why Architecture Matters from Day One\n\n\nPicture this: You've just launched your Next.js app, excited by how quickly you pulled it all together. Everything feels neat, tidy, and manageable. Fast forward six months—your user base has tripled, your feature list has exploded, and now you're scrambling to manage performance issues, bloated component folders, and confusing API routes. What happened?\nHere's the harsh reality: scalable architecture isn't an afterthought; it’s foundational. Poor architecture decisions made today become painful and costly technical debt tomorrow.\nBut what exactly is a \"scalable architecture,\" especially when we talk about Next.js?\nSimply put, scalable architecture in Next.js means structuring your project from the beginning in a way that easily accommo…",
