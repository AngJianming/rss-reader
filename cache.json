That's where requestAnimationFrame comes in. This powerful JavaScript method synchronizes animations with the browser's rendering cycle, offering smoother motion and better performance than traditional interval-based approaches.

          "description": "لا شك أن كثيرًا منّا قد تصفّح مواقع أجنبية تقدّم خدمات رقمية مدفوعة، ولاحظ أن هناك أسماءً شبه موحّدة تُستخدم لتصنيف العروض أو باقات الأسعار، مثل:\nBasic – Standard – Pro – Premium – Ultimate\nهذه المصطلحات – وإن كانت مألوفة – فإنها تفقد شيئًا من دلالتها ورونقها حين تُستعمل خارج سياقها الأصلي، أي خارج اللغة والثقافة الإنجليزية. بل العجيب أنها أصبحت معيارًا شبه عالمي، تتبنّاها مواقع وشركات ناطقة بلغات مختلفة مثل الروسية، والفرنسية، والإسبانية، وغيرها.\nلكن ماذا عنّا نحن العرب؟\n\n\nحين حاولنا ترجمة هذه التسميات إلى العربية، ظهرت لنا مفردات مثل:\nBasic = أساسي\nStandard = معياري\nPro = احترافي\nلكنها جاءت مبتذلة، بلا طعم أو وقع حقيقي في الذهن العربي، وكأننا نسقط كلمات بلا روح في غير بيئتها الطبيعية.\nلماذا يحدث هذا؟\n\n\nالسبب ليس ضعف الترجمة فقط، بل يعود إلى اختلاف الإحساس بالكلمة والمعنى الثقافي الذي تحمله. فالكلمات ليست مجرد مرادفات لغوية، بل كيانات تحمل شعورًا، وتجربة، ومكانًا في العقل والوجدان. خذ مثلًا النكتة: ما يُضحك باللغة العربية قد لا يُفهم أصلًا إذا تُرجم حرفيًا إلى الإنجليزية، والسبب هو اختلاف المرجع الثقافي والنفسي بين اللغات.\nهل حان وقت تأسيس معيار عربي في تسمية الباقات؟\n\n\nنعم، بكل تأكيد. لم لا نُبدع تسميات تُعبّر عن ثقافتنا؟ لماذا لا نبتكر معيارًا عربيًا موحدًا مثلما فعل الغرب مع مصطلحاتهم، مثل اتخاذهم \"Lorem Ipsum\" نموذجًا موحّدًا في عالم التصميم والطباعة؟\nوفي هذا السياق، أعجبتني خطوة قامت بها شركة البيداء للحلول المعلوماتية، إذ وضعت تسميات عربية مبتكرة لباقاتها، تجمع بين الجاذبية والفهم السلس دون أن تقتبس من المصطلحات الغربية بشكل مباشر.\n\n\nدعوة للمشاركة والإبداع\n\n\nفلنحوّل هذا النقاش إلى مبادرة:\nما التسميات التي تقترحها لباقات الخدمات باللغة العربية؟\nهل يمكننا الاتفاق على قالب لغوي جميل، يليق بمواقعنا ومنتجاتنا الرقمية؟\nنحن لا نحتاج إلى استنساخ ما يُستخدم عالميًا، بل إلى إبداع ما يعبّر عنا نحن، بلغتنا وهويتنا وثقافتنا.\nوفي المقال القادم، قد يكون من المفيد أن نناقش معًا:\nهل آن الأوان لاستبدال \"Lorem Ipsum\" بفقرة عربية موحّدة تخدم المصممين العرب؟",
