          "description": "For over a decade, Microservice Architecture has been marketed as the ultimate solution to engineering and management challenges within IT solutions. Promoted as a way to reduce risks, accelerate development, and lower costs, these promises rarely hold up in real-world projects.\nHaving worked extensively on IT solutions of all sizes and complexities, I’ve come to see microservice architecture as an overhyped concept, driven more by misconceptions and financial incentives than by actual business value.\nIn this article, I break down the failure of Microservice Architecture’s promises and explain why the only real winners are those selling the tools and services—not the businesses adopting it.\nOne of the biggest challenges in the IT industry is the misinterpretation of terminology.

          "description": "As frontend developers, we’ve all experienced the frustration of pushing UI changes that inadvertently break visual consistency. Automated visual regression testing tools like Chromatic are excellent but often carry a steep learning curve and price tag, especially for small teams or startups.\nThat's why I built VizDiff, a streamlined SaaS solution designed specifically for Storybook components. VizDiff makes automated screenshot testing accessible and affordable, enabling you to catch unwanted UI changes before they ship.\n\nEase of Use: A simple integration into your existing GitHub workflow.\nClear, Actionable Results: Easily spot visual differences highlighted at the pixel level.\nAffordable Pricing: Plans designed specifically with small teams and bootstrapped startups in mind.\nAutomatic Storybook Screenshots: VizDiff captures screenshots during your CI process, ensuring your visual tests run smoothly without additional manual effort.\nIntuitive Interface: A clean, easy-to-navigate UI to quickly identify visual regressions.\nFast Setup: Integrates seamlessly into your existing workflow without significant setup overhead.\nGetting started with VizDiff is straightforward:\n Install the GitHub app on your repository.\nConfigure Storybook to push screenshots automatically.\nVizDiff immediately begins detecting visual changes, making them easy to review and manage.\n\nVizDiff was built to empower frontend developers and small teams. I'd love to hear your feedback—whether it's about your current visual testing workflow, features you'd love to see, or improvements to the overall experience.\nCheck it out here: https://vizdiff.io\nThanks, and happy coding!",

And depending on where you're at in your product journey, either one could be the right choice — or the wrong one.\nLet’s break it down, minus the fluff.\nAuth0 is perfect if:\nYou want zero setup\n\nYou need a hosted solution with docs and UI\n\nYou’re okay paying a premium for convenience\nAuth0 shines for early-stage teams who just want to move fast and not worry about token lifespans or identity providers.\nBut here’s the catch:\nYou hit pricing walls fast\n\nSocial logins, RBAC, custom claims = $$$\n\nMigrating away is painful\n…",

That’s where VC Dimension — short for Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension — plays a game-changing role.\nThe VC Dimension is a fundamental concept from statistical learning theory that quantifies the capacity of a model class (like decision trees or neural networks) to fit data.\nIn simpler terms, it answers:\n\"How complex can a model be before it overfits?\"\nIn 2025, with large-scale models and limited-label datasets, understanding the VC Dimension helps balance model complexity and generalization — the ultimate ML trade-off.\nHere’s why it’s becoming even more relevant:\nHelps prevent overfitting in deep learning.\nGuides model selection in automated ML…",
