This isn‚Äôt tied to forced downloads like in Windows. This is my freedom. \nüåç A world of options\nLinux gives you a huge variety of distributions, each suited to different needs. It‚Äôs like a builder where you choose what you need:\nI started with Ubuntu, because it‚Äôs stable, user-friendly, and has good documentation. But now I‚Äôm getting more interested in Arch and Fedora. I‚Äôve realized that in Linux, it‚Äôs easy to switch between distributions, migrate between them, and adapt the system to your needs.\nüíª Tech and CTF\nMy passion for CTF and cybersecurity gave me even more reasons to switch to Linux. This system provides me with the tools to work with security, set up virtual machines, create test environments, and perform various attacks. You can‚Äôt achieve that in Windows, not to the same extent.\nLinux is a system for people who not only want to use technology but also understand it from the inside. For me, it‚Äôs not just an operating system, it‚Äôs a tool for growth and self-expression.\nüåü My freedom\nAfter switching to Linux, I felt that I was finally in control of my system. It‚Äôs not just an OS, it‚Äôs an environment that allows me to build, optimize, and use my computer the way I need.\nüöÄ Final thoughts\nIf you‚Äôre tired of your computer not being yours, try Linux. A system where you decide how everything works. Where you can customize everything, automate it, and learn.\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a beginner or an experienced user ‚Äî Linux has something for everyone.\n\n\n  \n  \n  Linux #OpenSource #CTF #CyberSecurity #TechLife  #LinuxForLife #Ubuntu #ArchLinux #Fedora #Programming",

We wanted something fast, secure and reliable and since we are familiar with PHP; we chose to create the project using the Laravel Framework. \nWhy Laravel?\nLaravel has a big ecosystem and that helps developers to turn ideas into real products fast. With just a few tools we were up and running. We used Laravel Pint for clear and consistent style, Laravel Sanctum for API authentication and of course we used the famous Vue starter kit. \nDifficulties\nEvery developer faces challenges when they start a new project: Ours were: \nWe overcame the issues through communication and our experience from previous projects. For example, for the mini games we added a Battle page, where the users can vote which character they think would win in a fight. Also, we made a Who is page, where a random image appears and the users must guess the correct character name.\nNow for the technical part, we decided to use MySQL as database. For Hosting, we used Hetzner with Laravel Forge for fast and reliable deployment. Forge made the setup simple and withing minutes our app was live and ready to go.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis project showed us how rewarding, it can be to turn a simple idea into reality. Laravel helped us to develop smooth, but at the end of the day it was our creativity and collaboration that really brought it to life. One of the best parts has been hearing from users. People have enjoyed playing the games and gave us suggestions of new features.\nhttps://rotrivals.com \nTell us what you think! We would love to hear.",
