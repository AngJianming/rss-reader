          "description": "I was on the hunt for a tool that could give me a clear picture of my system’s SBOM (software bill of materials). I wanted to check license info and see which parts are used in all my microservices. That’s when I stumbled upon Qodana, which has a feature called SCA (Software Component Analysis). In this post, I’ll share my thoughts on this tool.\nI requested a trial account on https://qodana.cloud/ so I could test out all the features. Then I looked over public repositories for the technologies I usually work with.

I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework— it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!\nWhen I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane’s Context (or ctx for short).

          "description": "Git Branching Strategies: A Deep Dive into Rebasing vs. Merging – When to Use What\nGit, as a powerful version control system, offers various strategies for integrating changes from different branches back into a shared codebase. Among the most common and often debated methods are merging and rebasing. Both achieve the goal of combining work, but they do so in fundamentally different ways, leading to distinct commit histories and implications for team collaboration. Understanding these differences is crucial for maintaining a clean, comprehensible project history and fostering efficient development workflows.\nMerging is Git's default way of integrating changes. When you merge one branch into another, Git creates a new commit—the merge commit—that has two parent commits: the last commit of t…",
