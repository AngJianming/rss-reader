If you’ve ever wished your coding assistant could fetch information, organize your data, or search the web for you, MCP servers are here to make that a reality. This article breaks down what MCP servers are, how they work, and introduces three of the most practical servers—Crawl4AI RAG, Supabase, and Brave Search—that can supercharge your app development workflow.\nMCP stands for Model Context Protocol. In simple terms, MCP servers act as bridges between AI tools (like coding assistants or chatbots) and external resources such as databases, web search engines, or file systems.

          "description": "Graphs\n\n\nA tree is actually a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees. Simply put, a tree is a connected graphs without cycles.\n\nA graph is simply a collection of nodes with edges between (some of) them  \ngraphs can be either directed (like the following graph) or undirected. While directed edges are like a one-way street, undirected edges are like a two-way street.\nThe graph might consist of multiple isolated subgraphs. If there is a path between every pair of vertices, it is called a \"connected graph\"\nthe graph can also have cycles. An \"acyclic graph\" is one without cycles\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Adjacency List\n\n\nThis is the most common way to represent a graph. Every vertes(or node) stores a list of adjacent vertices. In an undirected graph, an edge like(a,b) would be stored twice : once in a's adjacent vertices and once in b's adjacent vertices.  \nIn order to implement of simple graph, the graph class is used because, unlike in a tree, you can't necessarily reach all the nodes from a single node. You don't necessarily need any additional classes to represent a graph. An array(or a hash table) of lists(arrays, arraylists, linked lists, etc.) can store the adjacency list.\nBut it isn't quite as clean. We tend to use node classes unless there's a compelling reason not to.\nAn adjacency matrix is an NxN boolean matrix (where N is the number of nodes), where a true value at matrix[i][j] indecates an edge from node i to node j( you can also use an integer matrix with 0s and 1s.)\n\nIn an undirected graph, an adjacency matrix will be symmetric. In a directed graph, it will not(necessarily)be.",
