Or spent a weekend patching, upgrading, and resizing database servers instead of, well, anything else? If you've nodded along, you know the operational toil of traditional database management. This is where Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) steps in, and frankly, it's a game-changer.\nIn today's fast-paced cloud environment, focusing on your application's core logic and innovation is paramount. Managing database infrastructure, while critical, is often undifferentiated heavy lifting.

To get useful results, you must phrase your wishes just right. In the world of AI, this art of wording your requests is called prompt engineering.\nBut fear not, brave adventurer – prompt engineering isn't as arcane as it sounds.
