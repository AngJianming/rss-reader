          "description": "Slices in Go are a very powerful data structure, demonstrating particular flexibility and efficiency when dealing with dynamic arrays. Slices are a core data structure in Go, providing an abstraction over arrays that allows for flexible expansion and manipulation.\nAlthough slices are widely used in Go, many developers may not fully understand their underlying implementation, especially when it comes to performance tuning and memory management. This article will deeply analyze the underlying implementation principles of slices, helping you better understand how slices work in Go.\nIn Go, a slice is a dynamically sized array that offers a more flexible way to operate than arrays. A slice is essentially a reference to an array and can be used to access the elements of that array. Unlike arrays‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Continuing to our last post on the rust language fundamentals, today we will discuss on language foundations. What are variables, constants and Mutability works in Rust.\nUnderstanding how to store and manage data is fundamental. Rust has specific rules around the variables and mutability that are key to its safety guarantees.\nlet :\n\n\n\nVariables are declared using the let keyword:\n\n\n\n\nlet variable_name = value;\n\nExample:\nlet my_var = 5;\n\nBy default, variables in Rust are immutable. Once a value is assigned with let , it can not be changed.\nThis default behaviour helps prevent the accidental data modification and makes code easier to reason about.\nmut :\n\n\n\nTo allow a variable'd value to change, you must explicitly use the mut keyword:\n\n\n\n\nlet mut variable_name = value;\n\nExample:\nlet mut my_var = 123;\nmy_var = 345;\n\nconst :\n\n\n\nDeclared using the const keyword:\n\n\n\n\nconst NAME: Type = value;\n\nAlways immutable, can not use mut with constants.\nMust have their type annotated\n\nCan only be set to a constant expression which is computable at compile time.\nOften used for hardcoded values and conventionally named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.\nDeclaring a new variable with the same name as previous one using let.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\nlet x = 5;\nlet x = x + 1;\n\nThe second x is a new variable shadowing the first.\nKey difference from mut: Shadowing creates a new variable, allowing you to change the type of the bound to the name. mut changes the value in place but not the type.\nUseful for transforming a value while reusing the variable name.\nVariables in Rust store data, which can be of various basic data types like integers, floats, booleans, and characters ( we will cover this in more details in coming articles).\nRust's emphasis on immutability by default, combined with option of mut and feature of shadowing, provides fine grained control over data manipulation.\nüëâ Follow @themayurkumbhar on Medium",
