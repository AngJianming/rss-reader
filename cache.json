          "description": "Workplace culture has become a key differentiator in attracting top talent, retaining employees, and boosting productivity. Companies are increasingly realizing that diversity and inclusion (D&I) are more than just moral imperatives—they’re business imperatives. Yet, despite widespread commitments to equity and belonging, many organizations still struggle with one crucial component: the language used in everyday workplace communication.\ninclusive language tool becomes not just helpful—but essential.\nThe Hidden Impact of Everyday Language\nInclusive Communication: More Than Just Political Correctness\nThe Role of an Inclusive Language Tool\nWhy Now? The Urgency of Action\nBuilding a Culture of Allyship with Allybot\nAllybot scales with you—supporting your journey toward lasting cultural change.\nThe Business Case for Inclusive Language\nThe benefits of inclusive language extend beyond interpersonal harmony. Numerous studies link inclusive workplaces to higher employee satisfaction, stronger team collaboration, and improved organizational performance. When employees feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to contribute their best work.\nMoreover, inclusive communication plays a crucial role in external branding. The way your team speaks internally influences how you engage with customers, partners, and the broader community. Companies that embrace inclusivity are better positioned to attract diverse talent, win consumer trust, and avoid costly reputational risks.\nMaking an inclusive language tool part of your organizational toolkit is not just a nice-to-have—it’s a strategic investment in your people, your culture, and your bottom line.\n**Take the First Step Toward Equity\n**Creating a truly inclusive workplace doesn’t happen overnight. It takes commitment, consistency, and the right tools to support behavior change. Language is a foundational element of this journey. By equipping your team with tools that promote inclusive communication, you lay the groundwork for a culture of respect, empathy, and equity.",

The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.\nThe announcement is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.\nAt the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.\nSource: GameStop\nThe news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies.\nGameStop (GME) stock shares have climbed amid the speculation, jumping 12% in March. February rumors helped fuel an 18% spike in GME stock prices.\nAccording to TradingView, GameStop shares closed at $35 on May 27 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market at the time of publication. The stock is up around 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of about 10%.\nCointelegraph contacted GameStop for comment regarding its Bitcoin purchase but did not receive a response by the time of publication.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.\nMagazine: Bitcoin vs. the quantum computer threat: Timeline and solutions (2025–2035)",

          "description": "Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.\nBack came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”\n“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:\n“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”\nAdam Back du…",

          "description": "Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services.\nAccording to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.\nThe service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their B…",
