This enables code generation, validation, and optimizations that would be much harder (or impossible) in many other languages. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through practical examples of Zig's compile-time programming and how you can use it effectively.\nYou can run code at compile time using comptime:\nconst std = @import(\"std\");\n\nconst num = comptime calculate();\n\nfn calculate() usize {\n    std.debug.print(\"Evaluating at compile time\\n\", .{});\n    return 42;\n}\n\nHere, calculate() is run at compile time, and num becomes a constant value.\ncomptime Parameters\n\n\nZig lets you write generic functions and types using comptime parameters:\nfn identity(comptime T: type, value: T) T {\n    return value;\n}\n\nconst result = ide…",

In your case, you're trying to maintain a persistent map that holds instances of myCar, but you're encountering an issue where the map is reset every time addInfoToMap() is called. Let's explore why this is happening and how to fix it.\nWhy is myMapOfCars Being Reinitialized?\nThe main reason myMapOfCars is reinitialized each time is that it's defined as an instance variable (implicitly associated with each instance of the myCar class) rather than as a static variable that belongs to the class itself. Each time you create a new instance of myCar, a new myMapOfCars is created, which is why it appears empty when you call addInfoToMap().\nSolution to Persist Data…",

This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.\nDespite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives.
