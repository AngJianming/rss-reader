          "description": "To Cache or Not to Cache: Tradeoffs Between In-Memory Checks and Database Queries\n\n\nIn software engineering, many real-world problems boil down to tradeoffs, and one recurring decision is whether to query the database multiple times or fetch once and operate on data in memory. This seemingly small architectural choice can shape performance, reliability, and maintainability in ways that are easy to overlook but matter deeply in production.\nOne of the most fundamental and frequently encountered tradeoffs revolves around data access: when faced with needing multiple pieces of information about a single entity (like a user or an order), should we fetch everything once and perform checks in our application's memory, or should we make several targeted queries to the database, asking for specific…",

I’ve been working through some beginner problems, and while they might look simple to many, for me they’re a huge deal — and I wanted to share what I’ve learned so far.\nIf you’re new to coding or struggling to get started, this is for you. Let’s celebrate the small wins together!\nHere’s what I tackled recently:\nEven or Odd Number Checker\nI learned how to use if-else conditions and handle errors gracefully when the user enters something unexpected. It was my first lesson in writing friendly code that doesn’t just break.\n\nReverse a String Without Built-ins\nNo shortcuts here! I figured out how to reverse a string by looping through each character — it really made me think like a programmer.\n\nCounting Vowels in a String\nThis taught me how to loop through strings and do checks. Also, I learned that converting characters to lowercase makes checking easier, which was a neat trick.\n\nCelsius to Fahrenheit Converter\nI applied a real-world formula and added input validation — so the program politely asks for valid numbers instead of crashing.\n\nWord Count in a Sentence\nA simple but powerful way to split strings into words and count them, opening the door to more text processing challenges.\n\nWhy This Matters\nEvery expert was once a beginner.\nSmall wins add up to big progress.\nWriting code is as much about mindset as it is about syntax.\nIf you’re learning, don’t underestimate the power of these early steps. They build confidence and a solid foundation to tackle bigger challenges.\nWhat’s Next?\nThanks for reading my story! 🙏\nHappy coding! 💻✨",

We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”\nCNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.\n“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.\nMichael Saylor comments on Dimon’s announcement. Source: Michael Saylor\nJPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.\nRelated: Morgan Stanley advisers can officially pitch Bitcoin ETFs\nJPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. \nDimon’s Bitcoin bashing history\nDimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.\n“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”\n“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.\nAt the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.  \nMagazine: Arthur Hayes $1M Bitcoin tip, altcoins ‘powerful rally’ looms: Hodler’s Digest",

The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”\n“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRelated: New Zealand man arrested in $265M crypto scam tied to FBI probe\nThough “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.\nBacklash in the courts\nThe attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.\nCoinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers.
