          "description": "This is a submission for Frontend Challenge - June Celebrations, Perfect Landing: June Celebrations\nFor the June Frontend Challenge, I created a dynamic landing page commemorating Juneteenth — the powerful celebration of freedom in the United States. Rather than a static site, I wanted to take users on a scrolling timeline journey, visualizing key milestones in Juneteenth’s history through a blend of historic artwork and modern UI animations.\nThe concept was simple: let the years roll by, and let the story unfold.\nYou can find the Github Repository here: https://github.com/SoorajSNBlaze333/juneteenth-2025-landing\nTech Stack used\nThe Live version is deployed here: https://juneteenth-2025-landing.vercel.app/\nThis challenge was my playground for deep-diving into Framer Motion — its ability to animate layouts and transitions is truly next level.\nI didn’t want just a “nice layout.” I wanted it to feel like history was scrolling past you — smooth, respectful, and elegant. So I layered in a few small but impactful touches:\nThoughtful Details:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What's next\n\n\nAlthough I’m proud of the final result, there’s always room to improve:\nThis project means more than just code. Juneteenth is a story of struggle and celebration, and I wanted to reflect that with carefully chosen visuals and deliberate design. It’s a tribute through UI, and I hope it both informs and inspires.\nLet me know your thoughts — feedback is welcome! 🙌",

          "description": "从零开始的Hyperlane框架学习之旅：一个大三学生的真实体验\n\n\n作为一名大三计算机系的学生，我在上学期的分布式系统课程项目中初次接触到了 Hyperlane 这个 Rust HTTP 框架。从最初的好奇到后来的深入使用，这个框架给我留下了深刻的印象。今天，我想分享一下我使用 Hyperlane 的心路历程。\n第一次看到 Hyperlane 的文档时，我就被它的设计理念所吸引。作为一个性能导向的轻量级框架，它在保持高性能的同时，还提供了非常友好的开发体验。\n首先，我只需要在 Cargo.toml 中添加一行依赖：\n[dependencies]\nhyperlane = \"5.25.1\"\n\n相比其他框架动辄几十个依赖项，Hyperlane 只依赖 Tokio 和标准库，这让我在项目初始化时就感受到了它的轻量级特性。\n在传统框架中，获取请求方法可能需要这样写：\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();\n\n而 Hyperlane 提供了更优雅的方式：\nlet method = ctx.get_request_method().await;\n\n这种扁平化的 API 设计让代码更加清晰易读，也减少了查阅文档的次数。\n#[methods(get, post)]\nasync fn root_route(ctx: Context) {\n    ctx.set_response_status_code(200)\n        .await\n        .set_response_body(\"Hello hyperlane => /\")\n        .await;\n}\n\n这种组合式的路由注解比其他框架一个个声明方法要简洁得多。\nserver.route(\"/goods/{id:\\\\d+}\", |ctx| async move {\n    let id = ctx.get_route_param(\"id\").await.parse::<u32>().unwrap();\n    // 数据库查询逻辑...\n}).await;\n\n内置的正则表达式支持让路由匹配更加灵活，不需要额外的插件。\n在 AWS t2.micro 实例上进行压力测试：\nwrk -c360 -d60s http://localhost:8000/\n\n测试结果令人震惊：\n\n\n\n框架\nQPS\n\n\n\n\nTokio\n340,130\n\n\nHyperlane\n324,323\n\n\nRocket\n298,945\n\n\nGin (Go)\n242,570\n\n\n\n性能仅比底层的 Tokio 低 5%，但提供了完整的 Web 框架功能，这个数据让我在课程展示时收获了不少惊叹。\n#[get]\nasync fn ws_route(ctx: Context) {\n    let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();\n    let body = ctx.get_request_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(key).await.send_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(body).await.send_body().await;\n}\n\n无需额外的插件就能支持 WebSocket，这让我在实现实时聊天功能时省去了不少麻烦。\n在升级到 v4.89+ 版本时，我遇到了一些生命周期的变化：\n// v4.89+ 推荐的请求中断方式\nif should_abort {\n    ctx.aborted().await;\n    return;\n}\n\n但框架清晰的版本说明让我很快适应了这些变化。\nAPI 设计哲学：链式调用设计保持了 Rust 的优雅\n性能密码：建立在 Tokio 的异步架构和零拷贝处理之上\n中间件系统：洋葱模型提供了清晰的扩展点\n路由灵活性：在简单参数和正则表达式之间取得了平衡\n版本管理：仔细阅读 CHANGELOG 避免兼容性问题\n通过这次项目实践，我不仅掌握了 Hyperlane 框架，还对现代 Web 框架的设计理念有了深入的理解。接下来，我计划：\n深入研究 Hyperlane 的 WebSocket 支持\n探索框架如何在底层利用 Rust 的零成本抽象\n尝试基于 Hyperlane 构建微服务架构\nHyperlane 不仅仅是一个工具，它改变了我对编程的思考方式。每一次 ctx 调用，每一个中间件的编写，都在加深我对 Web 开发本质的理解。这个框架让我明白，性能和开发体验是可以兼得的，这就是 Rust 生态的魅力所在。",
