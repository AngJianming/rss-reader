This residue may result from data being left intact by a nominal file deletion operation, by reformatting of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media, or through physical properties of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered. Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information possible should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment (e.g., thrown in the bin (trash) or lost).\nVarious techniques have been developed to counter data remanence.

Traditional rate limiting techniques offer a static shield against abuse and overload, but they can fall short when faced with dynamic, ever-shifting workloads. Inspired by the adaptive system design strategies from Alex Xu’s acclaimed System Design Interview series, this article explores a powerful, nuanced alternative: building adaptive rate limiters using AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease).
