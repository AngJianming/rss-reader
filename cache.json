          "description": "We need to talk about something that's been bothering me for months. I've been watching indie hackers and startup founders frantically cobbling together tech stacks with Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queues, Elasticsearch for search, and MongoDB for... reasons?\nI'm guilty of this too. When I started building UserJot (my feedback and roadmap tool), my first instinct was to plan out a \"proper\" architecture with separate services for everything. Then I stopped and asked myself: what if I just used Postgres for everything?\nTurns out, there's this elephant in the room that nobody wants to acknowledge:\nPostgres can do literally all of this.\nAnd it does it better than you think.\nLet me guess - you've been told that Postgres is \"just a relational database\" and you need specialized tools for spec…",

In JavaScript, where mutation can lead to unpredictable states and difficult-to-maintain code, the advantages of immutability extend far beyond the realm of cleaner syntax. This article examines immutability's historical context, technical underpinnings, and its impact on performance, drawing upon real-world applications and advanced implementation techniques.\nImmutability has its roots in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Lisp. The traditional object-oriented programming approach often results in mutable state, leading to side effects that co…",

Few things that I understood are :\nApart from these basic things , I finally completed my \"hello world\" ritual in Java !! Syntax to take user input got me off for a while , but I managed to understand the reason for it to be complex , which makes more sense once a beginner like me goes into depth of ever Keyword popping on IDE .

Felt good to wrap things up on a high note.\nBut that’s not all—this blog marks the 14th consecutive blog.\n\nTwo whole weeks of consistency. I’ve never stuck to something like this before, and it genuinely feels great. It’s not about how perfect the posts are—it’s the habit. The discipline. The little 10-15 minutes I’ve been giving to show up every single day. That’s what I’m proud of.\nAfter the exam, I went out for a family dinner, so my energy levels were zero by the time I got home. No work done today, and that’s okay. We all need breaks—especially after weeks of grinding through notes, deadlines, and projects.\nStarting tomorrow, I’ll be switching gears:\nBut for tonight, I’ll let myself breathe.\nExams ✅\nHere’s to consistency!\nSigning Off\nAnisha 💗",
