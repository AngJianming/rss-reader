It handles the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on their code rather than server management.  It supports various platforms like Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker.\nPrerequisites:\nBefore using Elastic Beanstalk, you need an AWS account and familiarity with basic AWS concepts.  You'll also need your application code packaged appropriately for your chosen platform.  For example, a Java application might require a WAR or JAR file.\nFeatures:\nElastic Beanstalk automates several crucial tasks: capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, and application de…",

This guide will walk you through the installation of Laravel 10 with PHP 8.1 using the command line.\nBefore you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:\nPHP 8.1: Check your PHP version by running:\n\n\n\n\n  php -v\n\nComposer: A dependency manager for PHP. You can check if Composer is installed by running:\n\n\n\n\n  composer -V\n\nIf Composer is not installed, you can install it by following these steps:\nOpen your terminal.\nRun the following commands:\n\n\n\n\n   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php\n   mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer\n\nNow that you have PHP and Composer installed, you can install Laravel 10.\nOpen your terminal.\nNavigate to the directory where you want to create your Laravel project:\n\n\n\n\n   cd /path/to/your/directory\n\nRun the following command to create a new Laravel project:\n\n\n\n\n   composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app \"10.*\"\n\nReplace my-laravel-app with your desired project name.\nNavigate into your newly created Laravel project:\n\n\n\n\n   cd my-laravel-app\n\nCopy the .env.example file to create your .env file:\n\n\n\n\n   cp .env.example .env\n\nGenerate the application key:\n\n\n\n\n   php artisan key:generate\n\nIf you plan to use a database, configure your database settings in the .env file. Look for the following lines and update them accordingly:\nDB_CONNECTION=mysql\nDB_HOST=127.0.0.1\nDB_PORT=3306\nDB_DATABASE=your_database_name\nDB_USERNAME=your_username\nDB_PASSWORD=your_password\n\nYou can run your Laravel application using the built-in PHP server:\nphp artisan serve\n\nBy default, your application will be available at http://localhost:8000.\nYou have successfully installed Laravel 10 with PHP 8.1! You can now start developing your web applications using this powerful framework. For more information, refer to the Laravel documentation.",
