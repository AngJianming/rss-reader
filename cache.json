          "description": "What does leadership look like in a world that never stops talking?\nWe are surrounded by people competing for visibility. In meetings, on social feeds, in public discourse. Volume and certainty have become currency. But every now and then, someone appears who commands attention by doing the opposite.\nThis piece reflects on one such moment. The appearance of Pope Leo XIV. Not as a religious event, but as a cultural one. A moment when silence said more than slogans. When presence outweighed performance.\nIn a digital world exhausted by noise, it feels like a rare reminder that stillness can still mean something.\nFull article",

This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein‚Äôs contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization‚Äôs transformative potential.\nReal estate represents the world‚Äôs largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista.
