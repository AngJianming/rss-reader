Feel free to follow along and share thoughts!\nJava is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It‚Äôs widely used in enterprise environments.

If you disagree, I don‚Äôt care ‚Äî it‚Äôs a fact. üëæ\nLet‚Äôs be honest. Java documentation is not the best. Trying to find something there can be hard, especially when you‚Äôre just starting your Java journey.

One great option is ‚ÄúIntroduction to Programming and Computer Science‚ÄîFull Course‚Äù by freeCodeCamp.org.\nLink of the video üß†\nAfter that, you should follow the Java Developer Roadmap.

In this post, we will learn how to dereference these references and some of the caveats that perl has when it comes to dealing with references.\nFirstly in Perl it's important to understand that references are scalar values. This means that you can create a reference to a reference, and a reference to a reference to a reference, and so on. This is called a \"deep reference\" in programming.\nTo declare a reference to any scalar, you use the backslash operator ('\\'). For example:\nmy $scalar = 42;\nmy $scalar_ref = \\$scalar;\n\nTo dereference a scalar reference, you use the dereferencing operator ('$').
