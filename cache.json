          "description": "I was scrolling through Instagram Reels recently when an ad, presented as a \"tutorial,\" caught my eye. It was for a Photoshop plugin called \"DITHERTONE Pro,\" showcasing a rather striking visual effect – lines that seemed to follow an image's contours, giving it a distinct, almost cyberpunk aesthetic.

Not because I'm against paying for well-crafted software, but because the effect itself felt incredibly familiar. It was a strong sense of déjà vu, like I'd seen this exact visual style generated somewhere else, in a context far removed from polished, commercial plugins.\nMy mind immediately jumped back a few years.
