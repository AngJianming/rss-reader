          "description": "When you’re starting learning databases, one of the first questions is: What are the differences between MySQL and MongoDB? They’re both interesting, but built for different purposes.\nMySQL is structured, relational, and based on SQL.\nMongoDB is flexible, document-based, and schema-less by default.\nTo really understand the difference, it helps to model something familiar, like how you store data in countries and cities.\nLet’s see how you can design this model in both MySQL and MongoDB, and how you can do it visually - using the DbSchema tool.\nDbSchema is not a database itself. It’s a visual tool that connects to your MySQL or MongoDB server and works directly with your database. Once connected, it shows you the real structure of your data - the tables or collections, the columns or fields,…",

We caught it just before release, but the incident stuck with me. Not because the fix was hard, but because we almost didn’t test for it.\nWhy?\nIt was a threat we hadn’t considered. And that’s exactly the problem.\nToo often, security is treated as something outside the scope of test automation. It belongs to another team. It’s handled post-deployment. It’s someone else’s job.\nBut in today’s world, where software systems are interconnected, user data flows freely, and attackers automate faster than we do—security can’t be an afterthought.

          "description": "\"The Evolution of Email Threats: From Spam to Advanced Phishing\" delves into the significant transformation of email threats over the years, highlighting how cybercriminals have adapted their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in digital communication. In the early days, email threats were primarily characterized by spam—unwanted messages that cluttered inboxes but were relatively easy to identify. However, as awareness grew and spam filters improved, attackers shifted their focus to more sophisticated phishing techniques. Email Spoofing Tool: Modern phishing attacks often use email spoofing tools, allowing cybercriminals to impersonate trusted sources, making it challenging for recipients to discern legitimate emails from malicious ones. Phishing Email Example: Today’s phishing emails are highly personalized and can closely mimic legitimate communications from banks or colleagues, often containing urgent requests that pressure users into revealing sensitive information. Phishing Protection: To combat these evolving threats, organizations must implement robust phishing protection strategies, including advanced filtering solutions, employee training programs, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to safeguard sensitive data effectively. Understanding this evolution is crucial for both individuals and businesses looking to enhance their defenses against increasingly sophisticated email-based threats.\nFrom Spam to Phishing: The Early Days\nhttps://forfend.co/",
