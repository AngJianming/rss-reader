But the size of the infrastructure grew and this approach couldn't scale. Chef and Puppet popularized the idea of Infrastructure-as-Code: engineers would define the state of the machine(s) in text files, stored in Git–hence the name. A global node would read these files to create a registry. Then, a local agent on each machine would check the desired state at regular intervals, and reconcile the current state with the registry.\nThe first generation of IaC managed the state of existing machines but assumed the machine was already there. The migration to the Cloud created another issue: how do you create the machine in the first place? Another IaC tool appeared in the fo…",

We often need to deliver fast, but how do we ensure the software is robust, scalable, and maintainable? Let’s discuss a few strategies that can help your team achieve both.\nPrioritize Core Features\nFocus on the MVP: Start by building only the most essential features and leave the rest for later.\nSet clear requirements: Avoid scope creep and unnecessary rework by aligning on priorities early.\n\n\nAutomate to Speed Up Development\n\n\nUse CI/CD and automated tests to ensure quick, error-free deployments.\n\n\nAutomation helps free up time for developers to focus on quality.\n\n\nEfficient Code Reviews\n\n\nCode reviews are key to maintaining quality. But instead of focusing on minor details, concentrate on logic and security issues.\n\n\nKeep reviews focused and timely to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n\nPair Programming\n\n\nManage Technical Debt\n\n\nDon’t let technical debt accumulate! Dedicate time to refactor and improve code quality each sprint.\n\n\nTrack technical debt using tools like SonarQube.\n\n\nContinuous Improvement\n\n\nHold regular retrospectives to identify bottlenecks and improve processes.\n\n\nEncourage your team to experiment with new tools and techniques to continuously improve.\n\n\n\nBalancing speed and quality is a continuous process.

          "description": "At least some of the top holders of Donald Trump’s memecoin who apply to attend a private dinner with the president could be based outside the United States.\nAccording to a May 7 Bloomberg report based on an analysis of the top TRUMP tokenholders, 19 of the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard used foreign exchanges that exclude US-based customers, suggesting either foreign nationals or Americans living abroad. In addition, more than half of the top 220 holders — the group eligible to apply for a dinner with the president — also used exchanges in other countries.\nTop 10 TRUMP memecoin holders as of May. 7.

          "description": "Opinion by: Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail \nOn paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.\nAnd yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?\nThe harsh reality is that decentralized social networks hav…",

This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.\nThe TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.\nSafeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.\nRelated: Fully onchain AI agents can be the key…",
