          "description": "Hi there! I'm Shrijith Venkatrama, founder of Hexmos. Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a first of its kind tool for helping you automatically index API endpoints across all your repositories. LiveAPI helps you discover, understand and use APIs in large tech infrastructures with ease.\nThe web runs on HTTPS, and getting certificates used to be a manual, error-prone mess. Enter the ACME protocol, a game-changer that automates certificate issuance and renewal. If you’ve ever set up Let’s Encrypt or wondered how servers magically keep their HTTPS certificates fresh, this is the tech behind it. In this post, we’ll break down how ACME works, why it matters, and how you can use it. Expect practical examples, code, and enough detail to make you dangerous (in a good way).\nACME (Automatic Certificate…",

          "description": "In today’s healthcare landscape, cybersecurity is not just about compliance—it’s about patient safety. The complexity of electronic health records (EHR), interconnected medical devices, and hybrid IT environments has made healthcare an attractive target for cybercriminals. That’s why adopting privileged access management best practices is no longer optional for healthcare organizations aiming to secure sensitive patient data and operational integrity.\nModern healthcare institutions must evolve their access strategies to safeguard privileged accounts used by IT admins, doctors, third-party vendors, and even automated systems. Mismanagement or compromise of these accounts can result in HIPAA violations, massive data breaches, and serious disruptions in clinical care.\nPrivileged accounts in h…",

One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through intelligent caching. When a client requests data that hasn't changed since their last request, wouldn't it be great if we could just tell them \"you already have this\"? That's exactly what the HTTP 304 Not Modified status code is for.\nHowever, implementing 304 Not Modified effectively can be tricky, especially when in the real world data lives in a database. How do you efficiently determine if the data has truly changed without re-fetching and re-processing everything? This is where Delta comes in.

          "description": "Hey, I'm Omar, and this time I wanted to bring you some good news about the latest release of LightningChart JS Trader 3.1.\nLightningChart JS Trader is a high-precision chart suite for creating next-gen financial & trading applications.\nIn this release, we focused on adding quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. Here are some of the changes:\nStarting with version 3.1, LightningChart JS Trader is available for download from the public NPM registry. Previously, it was distributed via separate files sent by email. \nA valid license key (trial or purchased) is still required to use the library. Older versions will not be published on NPM. With this change, we are simplifying both updates and trial downloads.\nYou can now set the chart to use a transparent background, making it easier to match the application’s background. Here is an example of a chart with a transparent background. The colors come from the underlying div-elements:\n\nThe Mountain chart type can now be colored using a gradient fill. The coloring is based on the current line color and the enableMountainGradient() method can be used to switch the gradient on and off.\n\nTime range methods\nHTML text rendering\nMenu options\nClear everything method\nProblem with the space bar not closing menus anymore when typing in the input fields\nThe menus work better now when the chart height is small\nColor pickers now appear next to the color button instead of the top-left corner.\nHowever, note that Firefox browser has still some issues with this. Furthermore, the default color in the color pickers now matches the current color in all cases.\nWe also improved the accuracy of the data cursor The Zoomband chart height is now based on the main chart’s height, allowing it to scale better.\nAccess the latest version with a 30-day free trial. Or read the official release note.\nWritten by:\nSend me your questions via LinkedIn",
