Some examples:\n\n\n\nArrays (specifically 2D arrays or matrices) are used to represent pixels in an image. Since array elements are stored in contiguous memory, accessing them is very fast ‚Äî something that's critical in graphics rendering.\n\n\nTrees are a natural choice for implementing file systems.

In order to do so, we need to understand, what game engine is.\nI present my own definition : game engine is an abstraction layer over separate autonomous systems : graphics, physics, sound, networking, user input, storage. Design of such abstraction layer may vary.\nThis is what game engine must be. Flexible, customizable for almost any needs. Now let's find a definition for modern and popular game engines, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot : an ecosystem, that provides means for user to create games, including a visual editor for game contents and assets.\nAnswering short, best architecture is no architecture.\nentity component system (ECS), MVC or OOP patterns.\nI personally would recommend dynamically typed languages with FFI (foreign function interface) to C or Java.\nPython, Groovy, Lua or similar.\ndynamically typed language.\nFollowing idea of this article, best game engine is no game engine.\nMy definition of game engine is very close to that. Game engine must be a thin abstraction layer over separate independent systems, so after you just write game logic.\nMostly, game programmers don't understand their desires. What game they want to do. So, they choose a game engine to make an AAA game, usually it's Unity or Unreal Engine. And, usually they end up making 2D platformers or 3D hyper-casual games with low-poly graphics.\nUnity, Unreal Engine and Godot give their users an illusion of comprehension and development, while they don't clearly understand how most of systems work.\nInstead of choosing game engine, choose programming language and libraries, and start writing games.
