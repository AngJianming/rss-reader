          "description": "In today's digital age, software doesn't just have to work - it has to last. Companies are increasingly investing in long-term solutions that can evolve with changing needs. That's where cloud services come in. It's no longer just a buzzword. It's quickly becoming the new standard for ensuring software stays relevant, secure, and scalable over time.\nBefore we dive in, let's define what we mean by cloud maintenance.\nSo why is cloud computing getting so much attention?\nTo understand how cloud services work, it's helpful to review their basic principles:\nMicroservices architecture. Instead of a single block of code, applications are broken down into smaller, independent services. Each service handles a single task. This setup makes updates and debugging much easier. If one component fails, the entire system doesn't fail.\nContainerization. Containers (like Docker) package software with everything it needs to run. This makes deployment consistent across environments. It also makes it easier to scale and roll back if something goes wrong.\nContinuous monitoring and logging. Real-time monitoring helps teams identify issues before users do. Logs provide detailed information, making it easier to troubleshoot and optimize performance.\nAutomation and CI/CD pipelines. Automation is the backbone of cloud service. CI/CD tools automatically push changes through the testing and deployment phases. This reduces human error and speeds up development cycles.\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC). With IaC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, teams manage infrastructure using code. This makes environments repeatable and easier to update or patch.\nMore in our article: https://instandart.com/blog/software-maintenance/cloud-native-maintenance-the-new-standard-for-software-longevity/",

          "description": "Drag-and-drop is one of HarmonyOS’s standout features. Since HarmonyOS 4 introduced the Data Transfer Station and enabled drag by default on the Image component in NEXT, it’s clear that drag gestures are being heavily promoted. Therefore, learning how to configure drag-and-drop properly is essential!\nHarmonyOS already provides a set of components with built-in drag-and-drop support, including Search, TextInput, TextArea, RichEditor, Text, Image, and Hyperlink. These components require checking whether the draggable attribute is set—if set to true, drag events can be triggered. A well-known example is the Bilibili feature where you can \"drag out\" characters 22 and 33—that works because their Image components have draggable set to true by default.\nTo initiate drag behavior, the key is to imp…",

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.\nHere’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.\n\nWhat is tsUSDe, and why use it?\nTsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.\nBut if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …",

If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?\nEven in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. \nStrength in scarcity\nBitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140.
