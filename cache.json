          "description": "Ethereum, once the undisputed leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications, is facing a critical juncture. Over the past year, Ether (ETH) has underperformed compared to rivals like Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano, leading to a decline in investor confidence and user activity. The rise of faster and cheaper alternatives, such as Solana, has further eroded Ethereum's dominance.\nAt the heart of Ethereum's struggles lies the issue of scalability. The network's limited transaction throughput and high fees have been persistent problems, hindering its ability to compete with newer blockchains. Despite the implementation of Layer 2 solutions and the transition to Proof of Stake, Ethereum still processes only 14–20 transactions per second (TPS), while competitors like Solana boast over 1,…",

They’re training intelligent code to mimic users, evade defenses, and evolve in real time.\nThis article breaks down how AI-driven malware is changing the game — and what we, as defenders, must do to stay ahead.\nAI-driven malware uses machine learning algorithms to analyze its environment and adapt its behavior to avoid detection.

Let's take a peek at the tangled history of its evolution from version to version and explore the different tools that power modern C# development.\n\nThe story originates with the .NET Framework. Its class libraries were initially created using a managed code compiler system, Simple Managed C. In 1999, Andres Hejlsberg burst into history by gathering a team to create a new language called COOL (C-Like Object Oriented Language). They originally planned to keep this name, but trademark issues forced them to choose a new one.\nFinally, in 2000, at the Professional Developers Conference, the .NET project was officially announced, and the language was renamed to C#.\nIts name could be interpreted in several wa…",

Source: CourtListener\nThe DOJ highlighted that Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed that his crimes were “not the product of negligence, naivete, or bad luck,” but rather the result of “deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive, and steal in pursuit of personal fortune.”\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.\nMagazine: Bitcoin $100K hopes on ice, SBF’s mysterious prison move: Hodler’s Digest, April 20 – 26",

But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.\nCollins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users. \nInte…",
