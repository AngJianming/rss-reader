What started as a search for “just a clean to-do list” turned into a bit of a rabbit hole.\nSo here’s a summary of what I learned after testing (and fighting with) a dozen+ task trackers in 2025. If you’re looking for something that fits your brain, team, or workflow — maybe this helps.\nChoosing the right task tracker isn’t just about features. The way your tasks are organized affects how clearly you think, how well your team communicates, and whether you spend your day actually building things — or stuck trying to remember what you were doing in the first place.\nIn 2025, most tools go beyond checkboxes.

Otherwise, send the cover letter to my email address.\"\n\nThat’s it — and within seconds, it generated a high-quality, job-specific cover letter and saved it in my Google Docs. No extra steps, no editing needed.\n\nOnce the Runner was completed, a mail was sent from my mail programmerpravesh@gmail.com to sudhapravesh2003@gmail.com\nHere's a Youtube Video for the Demo:\n\nBefore: Write, edit, proofread — 20–30 mins per application.\nImagine applying to 5 gigs in 5 minutes.\n“Runner H now writes my proposals while I sleep.”\nHere's the Tweet/Post on my Handle:\nIf you're a freelancer, or just someone tired of writing repetitive emails, try Runner H + Google Docs.

It did the job—but not without quirks. As JavaScript evolved, developers needed more control and predictability. Enter let and const, introduced in ES6 (2015). These newer keywords offer better scoping and help prevent unintentional errors.\nvar: The Old-School Way\n\n\n\n\nFunction Scoped: var is scoped to the function in which it's declared.

One of the most common ways to control the behavior of your code based on different conditions is by using if-else statements.\nIn this blog, we’ll create a simple Age Category Checker — where the user enters their age, and the web page tells them which category they belong to — such as Child, Teenager, Adult, Senior Citizen, or Healthy Person.\nLet’s break this down step by step.\n1.Why If-Else Statements?\nJavaScript’s if-else statement allows the program to make decisions based on conditions.\nFor example:\nif (condition) {\n   // code runs if condition is true\n} else {\n   // code runs if condition is false\n}\n\nIt checks conditions from top to bottom and executes the first true …",
