In Blazor, as in other front-end frameworks, state management is key to ensuring that UI updates are predictable, scalable, and easy to maintain. That’s where b.state comes in — a lightweight, pipeline-based state manager designed specifically for Blazor applications.\nIf you’re familiar with the Flux pattern (or Redux in the React ecosystem), you’ll find many familiar concepts in b.state, adapted to the Blazor architecture. Both follow a unidirectional data flow and rely on actions to describe state changes.

Agentic AI의 핵심 개념\n인식(Perceive): 센서, 데이터베이스, 디지털 인터페이스 등 다양한 출처에서 데이터를 수집하고 처리함. \n\n\n추론(Reason): 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)을 활용하여 작업을 이해하고 솔루션을 생성하며, 콘텐츠 제작, 비전 처리, 추천 시스템 등 특정 기능을 위한 전문 모델을 조율함. \n\n\n행동(Act): API를 통해 외부 도구 및 소프트웨어와 통합하여 수립한 계획에 따라 작업을 신속하게 실행함.\n\n\n학습(Learn): 피드백 루프를 통해 상호작용에서 생성된 데이터를 시스템에 공급하여 모델을 지속적으로 개선함. \n\n\n\n2. NVIDIA의 Agentic AI 생태계\nNVIDIA는 에이전틱 AI를 구현하기 위해 다양한 도구와 플랫폼을 다음과 같이 제공한다. \nNVIDIA NIM (Inference Microservices): 사전 훈련된 AI 모델을 최적화된 컨테이너 형태로 제공하여, 빠른 배포와 확장을 가능하게 해 주는 서비스. \n\n\nNVIDIA NeMo: 맞춤형 생성형 AI 애플리케이션을 개발할 수 있는 마이크로서비스를 제공함.\n\n\nNVIDIA 블루프린트(Blueprints): 디지털 휴먼, 멀티모달 검색 증강 생성(RAG) 등 다양한 생성형 AI 사용 사례를 위한 참조 애플리케이션을 제공함. \n\n\n\n3. 에이전틱 AI의 활용 사례\n고객 서비스: AI 에이전트가 셀프 서비스 기능을 강화하고 일상적인 커뮤니케이션을 자동화하여 고객 지원을 개선함.\n\n\n사이버 보안: 에이전틱 AI는 위협 탐지 및 대응을 자동화하여 보안 운영 센터의 효율성을 높임.\n\n\n의료 및 과학 연구: 데이터 분석과 복잡한 문제 해결을 위한 도구로 활용되어, 예를 들어 환자 데이터를 분석하여 개인화된 치료법을 제안함. \n\n\n\n4. 결론\n5. 참고\n에이전틱 AI란 무엇인가?\nHow Agentic AI Enables the Next Leap in Cybersecurity\nAgentic AI란?",
