          "description": "What I Learned During the SheFi Program — And Why I Recommend It\n\n\nI started my journey into the world of crypto with a lot of doubts. I thought:\n\"If anything, I’d invest in ETH, not Bitcoin.\"\nBut even then, I was concerned about the environmental impact.\nReading more, I discovered that Ethereum had transitioned to a more sustainable consensus mechanism — Proof of Stake (PoS) — unlike Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW). That helped ease my conscience a bit.\nBut that was just the first hurdle.\nI set up my wallet and opened an account on a crypto exchange. That part was fairly smooth — I'm a software engineer, so I know my way around tech.\nStill, I found myself uneasy about usability and safety. Crypto addresses are long, unreadable strings, and one wrong character could mean losing your funds fo…",

Many newcomers face unexpected behavior in their text manipulation functions. This article will dive into why this happens, particularly focusing on how Backspace interacts with your cursor position and text storage.\nUnderstanding the Issue\nIn your C text editor code, when you press the Backspace key (ASCII 8), you're performing different operations depending on the cursor's current position. If the cursor is at the beginning of a line (cursor_x = 0), the function tries to merge the current line with the preceding line using strcat. Though this is an intended feature, it inadvertently leads to the upper line …",

          "description": "Did you know you can create dynamic routes in Next.js with just four lines of code?\nAs a freelancer working on front-end projects to pay the bills (thanks, American healthcare system), I recently discovered how to create dynamic routes in Next.js without any extra complications.\nThe Problem\nI was tasked with creating a list of dashboards for Annual Performance Reviews (APR). Each APR has a unique name, and each one needs its own route, like: \nhttp://localhost:3000/apr/[ReviewType]\nWith a large dataset containing various types of APRs, manually creating each route by making individual folders inside the app directory wasn’t feasible:\n-- app\n\n\nManually replacing review[index].type with the actual review types from my data would be tedious and inefficient.\nThe Solution\nI simplified the structure by creating a single folder: \n-- app\n\n\nUsing square brackets in a folder name creates what Next.js calls a Dynamic Segment. With a Dynamic Segment, you can access all the parameters using the useRouter hook.\nIn my case, I didn’t need to use the hook because I already had the review types, and the slugs in the URL matched those types. The solution was straightforward: \nconst reviewType = reviewsType.find((rt) => rt.slug === params.reviewType);\nThe {params} are the props in the page.jsx file of my Dynamic Route. If the reviewType from the URL matches the slug type, it’s a valid reviewType, and I can create the slug.\nIt’s that simple. Later, I'll call the Links with their href destination to generate the user’s click in the sidebar component: \nreviewsType.map((rt) => <Link href={/apr/${rt.slug}}> {rt.title} </Link>);\nConclusion\nNext.js routing is incredibly powerful and easy to use. I’m excited to continue exploring all of Next.js’s capabilities and preparing a course for developers like me.

          "description": "The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins of 2025 Act, known as the GENIUS Act, failed to pass cloture in the United States Senate on May 8, dealing a slight blow to cryptocurrency regulation in the country.\nThe bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.\nTo address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.\nThe GENIUS Act was seen as a bipartisan effort to increase regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The focus of the bill, stablecoins used for payments, was looked at as extending dollar dominance internationally and straying away from more controversial crypto topics.\nAfter the procedure failed, Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats, saying, “Democrats have been accommodated every step of the way […] frankly, I just don’t get it.”\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",

From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.\nAnd if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily.
