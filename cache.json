          "description": "In Next.js layout.tsx is a shared UI component between routes. layout.tsx never rerenders when we navigate from one route to another. We use layout to render static elements that are not supposed to be changed. Like, the Header, Footer, etc. It means, layout keeps your component/pages or UI the same way and renders the page.tsx in it as children, if you want.\n\nlayout and template\n\n\nJust like layout template also wraps the pages and components as children. But the main difference between layout and template is, layout can keep the current state, but template can't. That's why layout does not change the UI or does not manipulate the DOM. On the other hand, template does not hold the state value. It changes the state rerenders the UI, and manipulates the DOM.\nCreating a template is very simple. \nCreate a file named template.tsx/jsx/js.. in your desired directory.\nIn the template, returning a React component is compulsory.\nDo as you do in layout.tsx\n\n\n\n\nimport SignUp from './signup';\n\nexport default function MyTemplate({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <SignUp />\n      {children}\n    </main>\n  );\n}\n\n\nIn summary, don't use template for static assets. Use it for where state needs to be changed and rerender the component.\n'use client'\n\n\nSometimes you may need to use 'use client'.\nWhen you use any React hook or state (useState, useEffect) in your template\n\nAttaches event handlers or relies on browser APIs (window, document)\nImports other Client Components (e.g., a carousel, chart, or provider) \nOnce \"use client\" is present, all imports become part of the client bundle.",

Built on TypeScript, Angular enables developers to create scalable, high-performance single-page applications (SPAs) using a component-based architecture, which breaks the user interface into reusable, self-contained pieces for easier development and maintenance.\nKey features include two-way data binding for seamless synchronization between the UI and application data, a robust dependency injection system for modularity, and built-in tools for routing, forms, and client-server communication. Angular also offers a comprehensive Command-Line Interface (CLI) for rapid project setup and development, as well as official support for server-side rendering and advanced UI libraries, such as Angular Material.\nTrusted by major enterprises and startups alike, Angular remains a top choice for building modern, reliable web applications in 2025.\nMy Linkedin",

          "description": "Over the last 10 years there has been an explosion in data gathering. For example, a study conducted by IDC in 2021 estimated that on average, approximately 270 GB of healthcare and life science data will be created for every person in the world. The National Library of Medicine predicts that by 2025 the world’s human population will be 8 billion people. The scale and scope of having this amount of data to leverage is both enormous and daunting.\nThis is not a new problem; the phrase “Data Rich, Information Poor” was coined in 1996 to define the struggles healthcare organizations had in reviewing medical data, records, patient information, and medical history.
