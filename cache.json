I also added a pinia store that drives/binds selection between the dropdown and the v-show. \nI have added a second endpoint, this one is an Interest Repayment Calculation a handy little calculation that can be used to quickly get an idea of how much borrowing money costs over time. I also added in a bottom part to show the JSON response as pretty print.\nI did not use Python this time! I have noticed that a request that involves a python script has a slight delay. This isn't a problem for big heavy tasks, but in these early API developments, the small delay is a little annoying. So the Interest Repayment Calculation is PHP only. \nThe UI is still a little raw, but in time I will polish it.",

In this note, I share what I have learned so far as a beginner exploring this fascinating field.\nDeep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses artificial Neural Networks - especially deep (multi-layered) ones - to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data in order to model and solve complex problems. It excels in tasks involving large amounts of data and complex patterns, such as image recognition, natural language processing and autonomous systems (like self-driving cars).

Promotions came, responsibilities grew, and I adapted quickly. But there was always something missing. Sometimes it was that my full skill set wasn’t being used. Other times, there was no room to grow, or worse—hard salary caps that punished ambition. The reasons are plenty, but the feeling was consistent: I wanted more.\nNot more money (although that’s part of it). More meaning. More control. More ability to build what I saw in my head without having to pitch it to someone whose vision was smaller than mine.
