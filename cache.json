This time, I’d like to dive into a feature that stands out from conventional programming languages: Enums.\nIn many languages, enums are used to represent states or flags by assigning consecutive integers or bit values (using things like iota() or auto()). A typical usage would be something like this in C++:\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main()\n{\n    enum class Color { red, green = 20, blue };\n    Color r = Color::blue;\n\n    switch(r)\n    {\n        case Color::red  : std::cout << \"red\\n\";   break;\n        case Color::green: std::cout << \"green\\n\"; break;\n        case Color::blue : std::cout << \"blue\\n\";  break;\n    }\n}\n\nBit-shifting (like 1 << 0, 1 << 1, etc.) is often used for flag enums too…",

Welcome to the world of Proxies.\nIn JavaScript, Proxies act as intermediaries for objects, allowing you to customize fundamental behaviors such as property reading, value assignment, enumeration, function invocation, and even operations with the new operator. Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), Proxies remain underutilized by many developers, despite offering impressive possibilities.\nA Proxy wraps a target object and defines traps that are triggered when specific operations are performed on the object.

It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. \nThese virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.\nIn industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made.
