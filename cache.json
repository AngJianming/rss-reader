          "description": "When working with ASP.NET Core Identity, a set of default tables is automatically created to manage user authentication, roles, claims, and more. These tables are essential for implementing secure and flexible identity management in your application. Here's a breakdown of what each table does:\nAspNetUsers\nUserName\nEmail\nPasswordHash\nPhoneNumber\nSecurityStamp, etc.\nThink of it as the main user profile table.\nAspNetRoles\nEach role is stored once and assigned a unique ID and name.\nAspNetUserRoles\nmany-to-many relationship between users and roles.\nIf one user is both an Admin and a Moderator, this table will contain two entries for that user.\nAspNetUserLogins\nexternal login provider like:\nGoogle\nFacebook\nMicrosoft\nTwitter, etc.\nIt includes the provider name, key, and associated user ID.\nAspNetUserTokens\n💾 Contains tokens related to a user such as:\nPassword reset tokens\nEmail confirmation tokens\nTwo-factor authentication tokens\nThis helps manage temporary access scenarios securely.\nAspNetUserClaims\nFor example:\nSubscriptionLevel = Premium\nDepartment = HR\nThese claims are typically used for fine-grained authorization.\nAspNetRoleClaims\n📄 Similar to user claims but tied to roles instead.\nExample:\n✅ ASP.NET Core Identity Default Tables Summary\n\n\n\nTable Name\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nAspNetUsers\nStores user account info like username, email, password hash, etc.\n\n\nAspNetRoles\nStores role definitions (e.g., Admin, User, Manager).\n\n\nAspNetUserRoles\nMaps users to roles (many-to-many relationship).\n\n\nAspNetUserLogins\nStores login data from external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).\n\n\nAspNetUserTokens\nStores tokens for things like password resets, email confirmations, etc.\n\n\nAspNetUserClaims\nStores custom claims assigned directly to users.\n\n\nAspNetRoleClaims\nStores claims assigned to roles (users get these claims via role membership).\n\n\n\nIf you found this helpful, consider supporting my work at ☕ Buy Me a Coffee.",

I'm not sure how this works but it said I could make a first post so here goes:\nHow are you all doing? \nI joined this community (which looks awesome btw) in the hopes of learning more in regards to coding. I have some basic knowledge of coding languages like Python and HTML and have taken part in a hackathon once upon a time. \nAlthough I havent made any projects recently and I think thats something I need to work on so I'm going to try my best to do more of that. \nIf you have a project that you're working on and dont mind someone with little to no experience in coding, do let me know. As what I lack in experience I make up for in enthusiasm, words of encouragement and memes. Hopefully if you do let me join your team we get some sort of work done. In all seriousness I plan on getting better at coding so I'll have more to offer. Also if you require a video editor, I am very confident in my video editing capabilities and have made a video for a Star Wars hackathon which I took part in last year (I'll put the video in my next post).\nCurrently I'm self-studying Harvards CS50 intro to computer science and its very interesting. I hope to learn more and grow with you all. Thanks for making this community.\nP.S I'm a huge Naruto fan (hence my cover image/gif), its a topic I'm extremely knowledgeable about but unfortunately cant add to my CV.
