With the rise of AI tools for developers, we're not just changing how code is written—we're witnessing a transformation in who writes code, what skills are in demand, and how developers create value. For many in tech, it’s an exciting yet unsettling time.\nFor years, programmers enjoyed high salaries thanks to a strong demand for software and a shortage of qualified talent. But that’s starting to change.\nRecent data reveals stagnating or declining salaries for entry-level and mid-level developers. At the same time, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are now capable of producing clean, functional code for increasingly complex tasks.

Eles são responsáveis por lidar com solicitações HTTP (requests) e respostas HTTP (responses), permitindo executar lógicas antes e depois que uma requisição chegue ao seu endpoint final.\nPense em um middleware como uma \"camada\" que a requisição passa antes de chegar ao seu destino (e também na volta, quando a resposta é enviada ao cliente).\nAnalogia do Middleware\nImagine um …",

          "description": "I completed General Assembly’s Web Developer Immersive in 2016. Back then, the curriculum focused on Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, raw Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node). At the time, everything moved at breakneck speed—and while we covered a lot, I don’t think the fundamentals ever had time to really sink in.\nWhat I did admire was the program’s emphasis on building and deploying projects. You were thrown into the deep end—forced to wrestle with unfamiliar concepts and figure things out as you built. Pre-LLM, that approach made sense. You just pushed through and got something working. Whether that led to long-term understanding, though, was a different story.\nIt wasn’t until I enrolled in CSMC 203: Introduction to Programming at Montgomery College that things finally began to click. That foundational class helped me breeze through CSMC 206: Python Programming, and from there, everything felt more grounded.\nEventually, I transferred to the University of Illinois Chicago to finish my CS degree. Being at a large public university, many professors rely on autograders to evaluate code. Imagine your first programming project being run through HackerRank or LeetCode-style tests without ever really being shown how to solve a problem. It’s easy to see how that could be discouraging—maybe even enough to push someone out of the field entirely.\nAnd UIC? They pile on the homework, especially in the engineering department.\nThere isn’t much space to breathe, let alone learn deeply, until the semester ends. I’ve been balancing work and school for a while now, and I finally have the time and mental bandwidth to prove what I’m capable of—not as a cog in an assembly line, but as a developer who builds with intention.\nOver the coming months, I plan to build and share 12 projects that demonstrate why I’m a senior developer—and why I’m qualified for just about any role I apply to.",
