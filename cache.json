That‚Äôs where image annotation comes in‚Äîthe process of labeling and highlighting objects, features, patterns, or any other elements of an image that may be useful for a machine learning program or model. However, performing image annotation in-house can also be time-consuming, resource-intensive, and expensive. This is one of the reasons why outsourced image annotation has become a popular approach.

She argues that humans are an inevitable part of these processes, whether as active or passive stakeholders.\nShe uses several examples to illustrate her points, including challenges in autonomous driving and autonomous avionics.

Carbone said:\n\"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined.
