          "description": "Today's Question\nSolution \nThe boilerplate provided for this question:\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nfunction Toggle() {\n  function handleClick() {\n    // todo\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button>ON</button>\n  );\n}\n\nconst container = document.getElementById('root');\nconst root = createRoot(container);\nroot.render(<Toggle />);\n\nThe first step to solving this will be to create the toggle state required to alternate between on and off.\nconst [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)\n\nThe toggle variable will be the current state of the button, and the setToggle variable will be used to set it to the new state we want it to be. The default state is false, because we will be alternating between 2 states - On and Off. The next step would be to write the alternating logic in the function provided\nfunction handleClick() {\nsetToggle(!toggle)\n}\n\nTo set the new state to what it should be, the current state simply just has to be inverted. The \"!\" sign is used to mean the opposite of the variable's current state. Finally, the function is assigned to the button tag, and the state is set to the variable we created.\n<button onClick={handleClick}>{toggle ? \"ON\":\"OFF\"} </button>\n\nThe onClick attribute is React's built-in attribute used to handle the event of the button being clicked. The text displayed on the button when it is clicked is being alternated by the ternary operator(?). When the state is true, the text displays \"ON\" and vice versa. \nThe final Code\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';\n\nfunction Toggle() {\n  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)\n  function handleClick() {\n    // todo\n    setToggle(!toggle)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>{toggle ? \"ON\": \"OFF\"}</button>\n  );\n}\n\nconst container = document.getElementById('root');\nconst root = createRoot(container);\nroot.render(<Toggle />);\n\nThat's all folks!",
