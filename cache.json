Streams in Dart are a powerful way to handle asynchronous data, but they can sometimes behave unexpectedly, particularly with broadcast streams. Let’s break down your situation and identify why your second listener on the transformed stream might not be working as you expect.\nUnderstanding StreamControllers in Dart\nIn Dart, a StreamController allows you to create a stream that can emit events. When you make it a broadcast stream, it permits multiple listeners. While the stream itself is straightforward, how the listeners are set up and how they consume data can sometimes lead to confusion.\nYour Code Breakdown\nHere’s the minimal sample you provided:\nimport 'dart…",

          "description": "Hundreds of billions of dollars in cross-border cryptocurrency payments flow globally, driven primarily by speculative investment, according to a recent report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nThe BIS study, published May 8, found cross-border payments using the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and the two largest stablecoins, USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), totaled about $600 billion during the second quarter of 2024, the final observation period covered by the analysis.\n“Our findings highlight speculative motives and global funding conditions as key drivers of native crypto asset flows,” the BIS said.\nCross-border crypto asset flows by quarter.

In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.\nRISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.\nOn April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new sc…",
