          "description": "The digital commons is under attack. Last month, a coordinated network of accounts, utilising AI tools to amplify, fabricated stories claiming voter fraud in the Arizona gubernatorial election, pushing demonstrably false narratives to millions before fact-checkers could intervene. This wasn’t the work of human trolls; it was a sophisticated operation leveraging readily available large language models, a stark warning that the lines of reality online are blurring, and few realise the scale of the threat. The rise of increasingly sophisticated AI, coupled with the accessibility of generative models, is creating a new battleground for influence. It’s a battle where the very nature of open digital communities – their reliance on authenticity, trust, and organic interaction – is being actively …",

          "description": "What is OData?\n\n\nOData (Open Data Protocol) is a standard that helps developers build and use RESTful APIs more easily. It provides a set of rules and guidelines for how APIs should handle things like requests, responses, filtering data, sorting, and more. With OData, you don’t have to worry about the technical details of how to structure your API—it takes care of things like HTTP methods, query options (like filtering and sorting), and data formats for you. It also includes advanced features like tracking changes, defining reusable functions, and handling batch requests. You would find connectors for OData in Power BI, MS-Excel etc., that makes it easier to consume the APIs from multiple clients. In short, OData makes it simpler to create APIs that are powerful, consistent, and easy to us…",

Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.\nScripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows\n\n\nCreate the script in VIM, complex_list.sh\n\n\n\nWrite and save the script in VIM.\n\n\n\nWe can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.\n\n\n\nGive the permission so the script can be executed.\n\n\n\nIf we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.\n\n\n\nOutput after executing the script by using the command ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn\n\n#CloudEngineer #SysAdmin #ITSecurity #TechTips #BusinessIT #Leadership",

They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.\nMany popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.\nThat’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.\n🧠 Why SaaSLaunchpad?\nBuilt with:\n🔍 How It Compares\n\n\n\nFeature\nSaaSLaunchpad\nVercel SaaS Starter\nSupaStarter\nShipFast\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source\n✅ Yes (MIT)\n✅ Yes (MIT)\n❌ Paid License\n✅ Partially\n\n\nAuthentication\n✅ NextAuth.js\n✅ Auth.js\n✅ Supabase Auth\n✅ Clerk/Auth0 (Paid)\n\n\nPayments (Stripe)\n✅ Full + Portal\n✅ Basic Checkout\n✅ Limited\n✅ With 3rd-party lock-in\n\n\nRole-based Access (RBAC)\n✅ Built-in\n❌ No\n✅ With Supabase\n✅ Custom\n\n\nVendor Lock-In\n❌ None\n✅ Vercel/Upstash\n✅ Supabase\n✅ Clerk/Auth0/Vercel\n\n\nEmail Templates\n✅ Nodemailer\n❌ No\n❌ No\n✅ With restrictions\n\n\nNotifications\n✅ Firebase/OneSignal\n❌ No\n❌ No\n❌ No\n\n\nUI Framework\n✅ shadcn/ui\n✅ Tailwind UI\n✅ Tailwind\n✅ Custom\n\n\nFree to Use End-to-End\n✅ 100%\n✅ Mostly\n❌ No (Premium only)\n❌ Some paid features\n\n\n\n👥 Built by Developers, for Developers\n🧑‍💻 Check it out on GitHub:\n🌐 Learn more about us:\nexcelorithm.com\n💬 Let’s Talk\n💡 Got a feature idea or found a bug?

If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.\nHowever, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.\nThis highlights the importance of …",

Source: Tether\nAccording to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.\n“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. \nThe company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. \nThe stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. \nEuropean Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins.
