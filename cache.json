I will occasionally post articles on distributed systems if I come across topics that should be added. Your engagement and feedback have been incredibly motivating, and I'm excited to announce my next series on Dev.to!\nStarting this Sunday, I will be launching a new series focused on system design, inspired by the book Righting Software by Juval L√∂wy. This book is divided into two parts: system design and project design. My series will concentrate on the system design aspect. This series will uncover why system design isn't just tech, it's an art like engineering itself.\nWeekly Articles: Every Sunday, I will release a new article that delves into various system design techniques and principles. We will dive into the real world examples.\nComprehensive Coverage: While the book will serve as a reference, it is not necessary to have it. My articles will cover almost everything you need to know.\nPractical Insights: You will learn an amazing system design technique that I personally find invaluable. I use it in all my projects, whether they are small or large, professional or personal.\nHands on: I will also try to deliver some hands on projects where people following will dive deeper into the concepts.\nI had the privilege of attending a System Design cohort led by Jeff Doolittle. The insights and knowledge I gained from that experience, combined with my day-to-day work on real-life systems, will be reflected in this series. I am committed to delivering the most valuable content, drawing from both the book and my practical experiences.\nStay tuned, and don't forget to follow me to get the latest updates!\nThank you once again for your support. Let's embark on this exciting journey of mastering system design together!",
