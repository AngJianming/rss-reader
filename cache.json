I wanted a compact, drop-in unique ID you can stash in any database and have sort itself‚Äîno extra tricks needed.

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.\nIn this week‚Äôs episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.\n\nAs of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or ‚Äúgrandfathering‚Äù period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app‚Ä¶",
