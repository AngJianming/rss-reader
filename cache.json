          "description": "API search is a pain point for developers in large organizations. With sprawling codebases, hundreds of services, and thousands of APIs, finding the right endpoint can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. At LiveAPI, we’re tackling this head-on by building a system that crawls code, indexes APIs, and delivers accurate search results. In this post, I’ll dive into how we think about accuracy in LiveAPI, breaking down the challenges, our approach, and the metrics that keep us honest.\nThis isn’t just about slapping a search bar on a codebase. It’s about making sure developers can find what they need—fast—without pinging half the company on Slack or digging through tribal knowledge. Let’s explore how we’re making that happen.\nIn a large organization, APIs are the glue that holds micr…",

If you’re a developer like me, always on the lookout for tools to boost productivity, this might be on your radar. So, is Windsurf AI the real deal? Let’s find out.\nWindsurf is an AI-powered IDE (formerly known as Codeium) that stays “ten steps ahead” of you. It goes beyond simple autocomplete: Windsurf’s Cascade agent fully understands your project and can generate, run, and debug code across files.\nThink of Windsurf AI as your familiar code editor (its interface will remind you a LOT of VS Code, which is a good thing!) but with a powerful AI engine deeply integrated into its very core.\n\nWhen they say “AI-first,” they mean it.

To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.\nSemler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.\nSemler Scientific share price. Source: Google Finance\nIn its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.\nBitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.\nMichael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024. \nMagazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",

The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.\nWhile blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…",
