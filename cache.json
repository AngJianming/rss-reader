Source: Tether\nAccording to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.\n“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. \nThe company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. \nThe stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. \nEuropean Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins.
