But as a compiled language, it does make sense for portability, and as a properly and strictly typed language, it makes performing complex operations easier to implement... so it was worth trying out.\nSeveral years ago when I was still a bright-eyed and busy-tailed distro-hopper, I kept on running into the same problem: \"which package manager command and keyword combination do I need on this distro again??\" I wrote a simple script I called Alpacka and ‚Ä¶",
