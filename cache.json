We’d prepped for weeks—like it was the Y2K of our time. My hands were sweating like I was about to launch a rocket into orbit. Except instead of NASA, it was me, a couple engineers, and an angry group chat called “Migration War Room”.\nAnd then... nothing happened. No crash. No downtime. No user tweets with “WTF is wrong with your app???”\nWe had done it.\nNow, I won’t pretend I’m some cloud-whisperer or DevOps monk.

Unlike virgin PET, which is made from new petroleum resources, r-PET significantly reduces reliance on fossil fuels, conserves energy, and diverts vast amounts of plastic from landfills and oceans.\nThe Transformative Journey: From Bottle to New Beginnings\n\n\nThe journey of r-PET begins with the meticulous collection and sorting of PET bottles. These bottles undergo a rigorous cleaning and shredding process, transforming them into flakes. These flakes are then melted and re-polymerized to create high-quality r-PET fibers, ready to be repurposed into a diverse range of products.\nThe Bad…",

In practice, 65% of people admit to re-using passwords across multiple sites. That means if a hacker snags your login from one breach, they’ve got the key to all the doors. In fact, security experts explain that cybercriminals use automated bots to submit stolen username/password pairs to dozens or hundreds of sites, precisely because many users reuse the same credentials. This attack, known as credential stuffing, relies on large lists of breached credentials and only needs a small success rate (about 0.1% of logins) to hijack thousands of accounts.\nWhen one site is compromised, every other account with that same password is at risk.
