This high-performance Rust HTTP framework fundamentally altered my view of web development. Here's a genuine account of my experience learning and using Hyperlane.\nctx Abstraction\n\n\nWhen I first began using Hyperlane, I was immediately impressed by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. In other frameworks, I was accustomed to writing more verbose calls, such as:\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();\n\nWith Hyperlane, this simplifies to a single line:\nlet method = ctx.get_request_method().await;\n\nThis design significantly boosts code readability, especially when handling complex business logic, by removing the need for deeply nested method calls.\nImplementing RESTful APIs with…",
