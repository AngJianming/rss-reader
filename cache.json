But what happens when a patent stands on shaky legal ground? For patent attorneys, understanding the full patent invalidation process is not just a tactical skill—it’s a strategic necessity.\nNavigating the patent invalidation process: from search to filing requires more than a basic understanding of legal statutes. It demands precision, foresight, and increasingly, technological sophistication. With the rise of AI-powered tools like PatentScan.AI, attorneys now have unprecedented capabilities to streamline prior art searches and bolster their invalidation strategies with speed and accuracy.\nIn this comprehensive guide, we walk through the entire invalida…",

This feature enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback without requiring the user to refresh the page. If you're working on a Blazor project and want to handle SSE data correctly, you may encounter challenges in parsing this stream.\nWhy You Might Face Issues with SSE\nWhen working with SSE in a Blazor application, a common problem is receiving zero elements in the stream. This often happens due to issues in the way the server sends the data or how the client processes it. For instance, if the data format isn’t correctly interpreted or if the connection is prematurely closed, parsing errors can occur. It’s essential to ensur…",

At first, it may seem daunting, especially when navigating various technical terms like current translation unit, other translation units, same translation unit, and all translation units. In this article, we'll break down these terms to help clarify their meanings and significance in the realm of C programming.\nWhat is a Translation Unit?\nBefore we discuss linkage, let’s establish what a translation unit is. A translation unit consists of the source code after the preprocessor has completed its task. This includes the original .c file and any header files or included modules that are brought in during the preprocessing phase. Essentially, when you compile a sou…",

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.\nHere’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.\n\nWhat is tsUSDe, and why use it?\nTsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.\nBut if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …",
