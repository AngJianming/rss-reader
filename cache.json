          "description": "üß† Introduction\n\n\nSuppose you're working on a large project and find yourself drilling props down multiple layers of components. And every time a prop needs to be updated, you repeat the same tedious process, updating it in every intermediate component. Isn't that frustrating?\nWouldn't it be great if you could store all your useState variables and helpful functions in one central place and access them anywhere in your app with a single line of code?\nThat‚Äôs exactly where the React Context API comes in. It eliminates the hassle of prop drilling and allows you to manage and share related state and logic more efficiently across your application.\n\nIf you've ever passed props through three or more components just to get them to a deeply nested child, the Context API is your rescue tool.\nThe Reac‚Ä¶",

          "description": "AWS released official EKS MCP Server today! \nI have already created my own MCP server for read-only Kubernetes operations which made me appreciate these four things about it.\nInstead of one-to-one mapping of K8s CLI commands to EKS MCP Server tools they have created very few tools by combining functionality. For eg, manage_k8s_resource tool manages all K8s resources and supports create, replace, patch, delete, and read Kubernetes operations.\nThis EKS MCP Server not only can access your EKS clusters but it can also create and manage new EKS clusters. It creates EKS Auto mode clusters by default. It uses CloudFormation to create new EKS Clusters.\nReally like how they have given access to LLMs their EKS troubleshooting guide via a tool so that LLM can check AWS in-house knowledge of their experience troubleshooting EKS clusters. The tool name is \"search_eks_troubleshoot_guide\".\nIt is always important to have least privileged access. Keeping in with that best practice, EKS MCP Server supports read only mode by default. If you are feeling adventurous add \"--allow-write\" option to give write access. This will still block access to sensitive info. There is another option to give access to that as well.\nCreating my own kubernetes MCP server gave me valuable insights into how the MCP server creation is done. \nThis EKS MCP server has simplified MCP tooling, added own knowledge of troubleshooting, added least-privileged option and can create EKS clusters using CloudFormation.\nYou can access the official EKS MCP server here. You can read about it in their Blog post.\nReally appreciate how EKS MCP server has handled all the functionality really well. Kudos to the EKS team.\nIf you are new to my posts, I regularly post about AWS, MCP, Kubernetes and Cloud computing related topics.\nDo follow me in LinkedIn and visit my dev.to posts. You can find all my previous blog posts in my blog.\nImage Credits: Generated using ChatGPT 3o",

          "description": "In a major step forward for synthetic biology, scientists at the Center for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona have used artificial intelligence to design brand-new DNA sequences that can control gene activity in living mammalian cells. This study, published on May 8, 2025, shows that AI can create synthetic regulatory elements‚Äîsmall pieces of DNA that decide when and where a gene is turned on.\nThe AI model developed by the team doesn‚Äôt rely on copying natural DNA. Instead, it generates new sequences from scratch that are customized to work in specific cell types. For example, the model can design a sequence that activates a gene only in stem cells that are on their way to becoming red blood cells, while leaving other cells alone.\nTo test their work, the researchers built these sequences in the lab and inserted them into mouse blood cells. The results confirmed that the AI-made DNA successfully activated the right genes in the right cells. That kind of control is incredibly valuable for future treatments where you want to change gene activity only in a targeted group of cells.\nThis kind of precision could lead to safer and more effective gene therapies, where unwanted side effects are avoided because the treatment only works where it‚Äôs needed.\nAI is now helping us go beyond what nature provides, letting scientists write DNA code that behaves exactly how we want it to. That changes the game for genetics, medicine, and our ability to design life at the molecular level.\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/05/250508112324.htm",
