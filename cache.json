          "description": "When you‚Äôre building a full-stack app with a separate frontend and a Flask backend, the browser‚Äôs Same-Origin Policy will block your API calls unless you explicitly allow them. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is the protocol that lets you opt-in. In this guide we will cover two common ways to get it done in Flask.\nFlask lets you set response headers directly, so you can choose which endpoints get which CORS rules.\nIf your frontend lives at https://myapp.com, you can allow it like this:\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify, make_response\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/api/hello\")\ndef hello():\n    resp = make_response(jsonify({\"msg\": \"hi\"}))\n    # allow just one origin\n    resp.headers[\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\"] = \"https://myapp.com\"\n    return resp\n\nWhenever the browser ‚Ä¶",

It highlights use cases, syntax differences, and practical scenarios where each may be preferred, especially when working with function types, inheritance, excess property checks, and optional fields. \nIn JavaScript, functions are considered first-class citizens, which means they can be handled like any other type of variable, including numbers, strings, and arrays. This allows functions to be passed into other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables for later use. \nThis feature is heavily used in asynchronous code, where functions are often passed into asynchronous functions, often referred to as callbacks. \nBut this can be tricky to use with TypeS‚Ä¶",

However, when scaling up to problems involving tens or hundreds of thousands of binary variables, classical solvers begin to falter due to the combinatorial explosion in the search space.\nQuantum computing offers a compelling alternative, not by brute force, but by exploring exponentially large solution spaces in parallel using quantum superposition and entanglement. One popular quantum algorithm for such problems is the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [3], a textbook example of a variational quantum algorithm (VQA). However, QAOA requires one qubit per binary variable, which becomes prohibitively r‚Ä¶",
