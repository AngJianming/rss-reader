          "description": "About Author\nGeoServer is a widely-used open-source server for sharing, processing, and editing geospatial data. It supports multiple mapping standards and allows users to access and interact with GIS data over the web.\nIn June 2025, two critical security vulnerabilities in GeoServer were publicly disclosed:\nSSRF vulnerability (CVE-2024-29198)\nXXE vulnerability (CVE-2025-30220)\nBoth flaws allow unauthenticated attackers to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. If you are running GeoServer, immediate action is highly recommended.\nWhen PROXY_BASE_URL is not configured, GeoServer allows unauthenticated access to the TestWfsPost endpoint. This misconfiguration can be abused to send internal or external requests via the GeoServer, resulting in SSRF.\n…",

At its core, GitOps hinges on four foundational principles: declarative infrastructure, using Git as the single source of truth for the desired state, automated synchronization of the actual state with the desired state in Git, and continuous reconciliation to detect and correct any deviations. This methodology has brought unparalleled transparency, stability, and speed to software delivery.

Since React is just a library, not a full-blown framework, it doesn’t force you into any specific folder structure or project layout.\nThat’s why in this post, I’ll be sharing what’s worked for me, based on personal experience and a lot of research.
