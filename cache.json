          "description": "SurrealDB is built to support the most demanding real-time applications, and now we’re making it even easier to get your data into the platform - with no code required.\nToday, we’re excited to announce official support for Fivetran, the industry leader in automated, fully-managed data pipelines.\nWith the new Fivetran connector for SurrealDB, businesses can integrate with hundreds of data sources - from Software-as-a-Service platforms and CRMs to transactional databases and warehouses - and sync that data directly into SurrealDB with zero manual overhead.\nFivetran handles schema evolution, data normalisation, and incremental updates automatically. That means less time building and maintaining ETL scripts - and more time building with live, trusted data inside SurrealDB.\n\nFor teams that prioritise reliability, scalability, and ease of use, this integration makes SurrealDB an even more powerful foundation for real-time decision-making, application backends, and AI-powered systems.\nThe SurrealDB destination connector is now available in private preview, you can therefore try it out by going to the Fivetran documentation or our documentation.\nAs it's in private preview, we'd really appreciate your feedback on the experience of using Fivetran with SurrealDB.",

Today, I’m a committed advocate for their power to transform software development. Dismissing AI as “just another bubble” isn’t just short-sighted—it’s a missed opportunity.\nFrustrating Beginnings: Early experiences with assistants like GitHub Copilot felt more intrusive than helpful—imprecise suggestions, unwanted autocomplete overrides.\nTurning Point at NikoLabs: As I integrated AI into projects like Axrisi and SchemaCraft, I saw genuine productivity gains. AI stopped being a novelty and became a daily collaborator.\nA New Perspective: Now, when friends still doubt AI, I struggle to convey the speed, creativity, and joy it brings to my workflow.\n\n\n\nPast Bubble\nWhat Happened\n\n\n\n\nGraphQL\nPowerful bu…",
