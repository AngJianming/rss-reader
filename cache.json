Before you can style a site with CSS or add interactivity with JavaScript, you need to understand how to structure content with HTML.\nWhen I began learning web development at @devsync, I had no idea where to start. Thanks to the structured training, mentorship, and live coding sessions at devsync.in, I quickly understood the core concepts and began building real websites.\n💡 What is HTML?\nHTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language. It uses tags to define different elements of a webpage.\nSome of the first tags I learned during my @devsync training were:\n – Root of the document\n to \n – Headings (H1 i…",
