Why switch from Chrome?‚Äù\nBut once I realized this was an experimental browser from Opera testing out agent-like AI features, I figured it was worth a look.\nI found the official info on Opera‚Äôs site. If you're trying to download Opera Neon, don‚Äôt get too excited ‚Äî it's invite-only for now.\nOpera‚Äôs been building browsers since the ‚Äô90s, but this might be their most ambitious idea yet.\nThe previews show a minimalist design and AI baked right in. It looks... different ‚Äî in a good way.\nThe Opera Neon UI looks like it was designed to end tab chaos.\nYou get visual tabs that show a preview of each page, which makes jumping between websites feel more intuitive than just staring at a bunch of favicons.\nThere‚Äôs also a floating sidebar that holds key tools like bookmarks, workspace controls, and the AI assistant ‚Äî all tucked neatly to the side without taking up valuable screen real estate.\nAnd that‚Äôs just scratching the surface.\nWant to know how Opera Neon uses AI to organize your tabs, issue distraction warnings, and even make activity-based suggestions?\nRead the full deep dive here:\n\nOpera Neon 2025: AI Browser Review\nThis article was originally published on patangrid.site and is syndicated here for broader reach.",

While AI promises innovation and efficiency, it also presents significant challenges that require urgent attention.\nUp to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs risk displacement due to automation, with unemployment potentially rising to 20%, a rate not seen since the Great Depression (Anthropic CEO Dario Amod).\nCurrently, 14% of the global workforce‚Äîapproximately 375 million workers‚Äîhave been affected by AI through job losses or career changes, with around 5 million jobs lost worldwide.\nThe most impacted sectors include customer service (1.2 million jobs lost), IT services (850,000), warehousing and logistics (1.1 million), administrative and clerical roles (750,000), banking (400,000), and retail (300,000).\nWomen‚Äôs jobs are disproportionately vulnerable, with 41% of female roles at risk compared to 28% for men, reflecting the higher concentration of women in automatable sectors.\nAttempts by companies like Clara and IBM to fully replace human roles with AI have demonstrated the limitations of automation, highlighting the continued importance of human skills.\nLooking ahead, by 2026, AI is projected to displace 75 million jobs globally but create 133 million new jobs, emphasizing a shift toward roles requiring new and different skills.\nThis transition risks exacerbating inequality, favoring those with greater education and resources, and posing a challenge for inclusive economic growth.\nThe path forward requires coordinated action:\nAccelerated workforce retraining and upskilling programs\nThoughtful regulation of AI adoption\nStrategic planning to ensure equitable opportunities in the evolving job market\nAs AI continues to evolve, organizations and governments must collaborate to create a future of work that balances innovation with inclusivity and social responsibility.\nHow is your organization preparing for the impact of AI on jobs?",

          "description": "No artigo de hoje, vamos falar sobre uma pr√°tica da qual eu j√° fui v√≠tima, e voc√™, leitor, provavelmente tamb√©m j√° foi (ou ainda est√° sendo).\nTrata-se da famigerada pr√°tica de criar endpoints excessivamente verbosos. Quando estamos desenvolvendo uma API REST para nosso sistema, √© comum tentarmos facilitar o acesso a dados muito espec√≠ficos. No entanto, isso muitas vezes se transforma em uma bola de neve.\nQuem nunca se pegou pensando: ‚ÄúS√≥ mais um endpoint e tudo estar√° resolvido‚Äù... e repetiu isso incont√°veis vezes?\nIsso acontece porque ignoramos um fator muito importante no conceito de API: ela deve servir como um portal de acesso aos recursos gerais do sistema, e n√£o como um grande servidor repleto de rotas altamente espec√≠ficas para cada situa√ß√£o.\nEsse problema costuma surgir, principalmente, quando lidamos com recursos que est√£o relacionados entre si.\nPense na seguinte situa√ß√£o:\nVoc√™ precisa listar usu√°rios que possuem tarefas atribu√≠das. A abordagem comum e tentadora √© criar um endpoint como:\n/getUsersWithTasks\nMas esse tipo de design fere princ√≠pios fundamentais de uma API bem constru√≠da. Em vez disso, pense na sua API como uma interface para recursos, e usu√°rios s√£o um recurso. Logo, uma forma mais adequada e escal√°vel seria algo como:\n/users?withTasks=true\nEsse formato segue o padr√£o REST, √© mais flex√≠vel e permite expandir facilmente os filtros no futuro, como:\n/users?withTasks=true&active=true\nEvite criar endpoints com verbos como get, delete ou create. Al√©m de quebrar os princ√≠pios REST, isso torna sua API redundante e desnecessariamente verbosa. Por exemplo:\nüö´ /getUserById\nAl√©m disso:\nPrefira filtros via query parameters em vez de encher a URL com par√¢metros.\nMantenha seus endpoints focados em recursos, n√£o em a√ß√µes.\nSeguindo essas dicas simples, sua API se tornar√° muito mais limpa, intuitiva, escal√°vel e f√°cil de manter.",
