          "description": "Introduction\nIn programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we'll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.\nUnderstanding Reference Parameters in Java\nWhen you define a method parameter in Java, it typically receives a copy of the variable's value.
