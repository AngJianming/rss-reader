          "description": "Hi there 👋\nFirst of all, I removed the fmt library from my project because of a simple reason- I didn't like the complexity that I had to introduce just to color the prompts in the terminal. Whether it be implementing its namespace, which I agree is very good and its way of formatting the string in the same way as python could help too, but the way it is implemented inside of the library can be made easier. And this is without addressing the other issue- configuring of CMake, even though I tried evverything written in their documentation, it just didn't work. If only it worked, my project would look so soo good, but sometimes you just have to part goodbye to some people to achieve good things in life.\nSpeaking of goodbyes, last night I added the GitHub workflow for CMake as I thought it would help people looking to contribute in my project, but it had some other plans. I never worked with any GitHub workflow, so I thought why not use GitHub copilot for this task, but it still has a long way to go before it replaces me or any other programmer in the world. It first created the yml file with outdated packages, then after updating the packages, it removed the checking commands which were the whole point of running the workflow in the first place. After this too, it didn't stop as it was running in the agent mode, it went on for a whole hour before I manually deleted the file to remove the hassle altogether (Yeah, the commits are almost consecutively because I pushed them late to the Hub.)\nThat's all for today, I will be back tomorrow with hopefully some good updates on this project.\nThanks! 🫡",

From predictive customer analytics to real-time sentiment tracking, AI has become the invisible engine powering marketing success across industries.\nTraditional marketing analytics relied heavily on retrospective reporting and manual data interpretation.

This reactive approach left businesses constantly playing catch-up with market dynamics and customer preferences.\nThe introduction of AI has fundamentally changed this paradigm. …",
