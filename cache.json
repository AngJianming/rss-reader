But after diving deep into implementing my own decision tree algorithm, I discovered several critical pitfalls that can completely undermine your model's effectiveness.\nHere are the key lessons learned that will save you hours of debugging and poor performance.\nThe Mistake: Processing your data in batches and building separate trees for each batch.\nWhy It's Wrong: Decision trees need to evaluate ALL available data at each split to find the optimal decision boundary. When you only use a subset of your data, you're making suboptimal splits based on incomplete information.\nWhat to Do Instead:\nUse your entire dataset for training (memory permitting)\nIf memory is limited, …",

They can be used for string matching, searching, and manipulation. Regular expressions are widely used in programming languages, including Perl, to perform complex text processing tasks.\nIn Perl regular expressions can be precompiled and executed using the 'qr//' operator, which allows you to create a regex object that can be reused multiple times.
