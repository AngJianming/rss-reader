          "description": "AI is quickly becoming a game-changer in the workplace—and it’s keeping employment and labor lawyers on their toes. From hiring algorithms to workplace monitoring and job automation, AI is raising big legal questions that didn’t exist a few years ago.\nHiring & Bias\nCompanies are using AI to screen resumes and interview candidates, but these tools can unintentionally discriminate. That opens the door to legal claims under anti-discrimination laws. Cities like New York already require audits of these systems, and more regulation is likely on the way.\nMonitoring & Privacy\nAI is also being used to track employee productivity—sometimes down to the minute. But with that comes concerns about privacy, consent, and data security. Employers need to be careful about how they collect and use that information, or they could run into legal trouble.\nAutomation & Job Loss\nAI is automating jobs across industries. That brings up issues around layoffs, retraining, and even union negotiations. Employment lawyers will play a key role in helping companies navigate workforce changes legally and fairly.\nLooking Ahead\nExpect more laws focused on AI in the workplace. As attorneys, we’ll need to understand both the tech and the evolving rules to help clients stay compliant—and ethical.\nThe bottom line? AI is here to stay, and it’s rewriting the playbook on employment law.\nCreated By: Dalton Breshears",

          "description": "As a junior computer science student, I was working on a campus second-hand trading platform project last semester when I stumbled upon the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework— it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!\nWhen I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane’s Context (or ctx for short). I remember the first time I wanted to get the request method. In traditional Rust HTTP frameworks, I would have to write:\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method(…",

          "description": "When working with Docker containers, managing persistent data is crucial. Docker provides two primary mechanisms for data persistence: Volumes and Bind Mounts. Understanding when to use each can significantly impact your application's performance, security, and maintainability.\nDocker volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated and used by Docker containers. They are completely managed by Docker and stored in a part of the host filesystem managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux).\nManaged entirely by Docker\nIndependent of the host machine's directory structure\nCan be shared among multiple containers\nEasier to back up and migrate\nBetter performance on Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)\nSupport for volume drivers (remote hosts, cloud providers, encryption)\n# Creat…",
