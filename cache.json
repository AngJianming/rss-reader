After finishing my IT degree last year, I'm officially embarking on a dedicated six-month journey to become proficient in multi-cloud technologies. I've joined Naresh IT in Hyderabad, and I'm ready to dive headfirst into \n\nAWS, Azure, and GCP.\nMy aim over the next six months is to gain hands-on expertise across these platforms, understanding everything from core services to advanced deployments. I'm especially looking forward to learning from Veerababu Sir, who comes highly recommended!\nI'll be documenting parts of my learning process here on DEV.to, sharing insights, code snippets, and probably a few debugging stories! The goal is to come out with a robust multi-cloud skillset ready for the real world.\nIf you're already in the cloud space, what's a fundamental concept you wish you'd grasped earlier? Let me know!",

It wasn't moving at all when it was on the screen.
