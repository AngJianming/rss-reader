          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nThe Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is the “S” in the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It’s often mentioned, sometimes misunderstood, and rarely applied correctly in large Java applications.\nDefinition: A class should have only one reason to change.\nIn practice, this means a class should encapsulate a single, well-defined responsibility — not “one method” or “one functionality,” but one axis of change.\nIn this article, we'll go beyond trivial examples and explore real-world SRP violations, how to spot them, and how to refactor for maintainability and testability.\nConsider the following UserService class:\npublic class UserService {\n\n    public void register(String email, String password) {\n        if (!email.contains(\"@\")) {\n            throw new IllegalArgum…",

          "description": "By Alireza Minagar, MD, MBA, MS software engineer\nAs a software engineer, I’ve spent most of my time making things work — efficient algorithms, robust logic, clean architecture. But recently, I gave equal attention to how software feels. Enter: SecureFleet, a desktop vehicle monitoring and management tool I’m building with Java Swing.\nAt first, it was utilitarian — basic panels, a static table, and a couple of buttons. But I realized that professional software demands more than just working code — it deserves thoughtful, responsive, and intuitive interfaces.\n🔨 What I’ve Implemented:\nA scrollable JTable with real-world vehicle tracking columns (Plate, Make, Model, Year, Owner, Status).\nA dedicated alert button (New Alert) highlighted in red for emphasis.\nA trio of functional buttons below: Track Vehicle, Add Entry, and Admin Panel.\nClear color contrast and alignment for visual clarity.\n🧠 What I Learned Along the Way:\nGrouping components into logical panels simplifies both alignment and code readability.\nGUI building tools (like NetBeans Designer) can help — but manual refinement makes the difference.\n🌟 Why This Matters:\n💡 What's Next:\n🗣️ Let’s Talk:\nHow do you balance aesthetics with functionality in desktop development?\nDrop your thoughts below 👇",

I started with HashiCorp's lru, which was simple and easy to integrate. But as the system scaled and concurrency increased, it became clear that it couldn't keep up.\nThis post highlights the issues I encountered and why Ristretto ended up being a much better fit.\nWhile the lru package is solid and predictable, I ran into a few limitations:\nBlocking Writes - All Add() operations lock the cache, leading to bottlenecks under concurrent load.\nFixed Capacity, Not Cost-Based - It evicts based on item count, not memory usage — inefficient when storing large items like files.\nNo Native Metrics - Hit/miss tracking mu…",

If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. \nOver the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible. \nIt i…",

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.\nIn this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.\n\nAs of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…",

The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. \nIn many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.\nThe most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend.
