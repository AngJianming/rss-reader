Over the years, Node.js has become known for its dependence on third-party libraries for executing most of its tasks, from TypeScript support to testing to environment variable handling. \nNode.js 24 ships with native features that improve developer experience, security, and reduce dependency overhead. You can check out our general overview of the Node.js 24 release here. But the subtlety of some of these new features is something I’m concerned many developers will miss. \nIn this tutorial, we’ll explore 10 Node.js features you might not be using yet — but absolutely should be.

Spoiler alert: it lives up to the hype.\nWhether you're crafting indie films, high-impact branded content, or elevating your YouTube visuals, this compact powerhouse is making waves for all the right reasons. Let's dig into why creators—from drone operators to docu-style shooters—are falling hard for this camera.\nFirst things first: don’t judge the RED KOMODO-X by its size. Sure, it looks like a compact camera, but under the hood, it's got serious muscle. This beast captures pristine 6K footage with a Super 35 global shutter sensor—a huge leap forward for filmmakers tired of the jello effect caused by rolling shutters.\nThat global shutter makes a difference.…",

          "description": "If you're using Tailwind CSS with Next.js or other modern frameworks, you've likely come across directives like @layer base, @layer components, and @layer utilities. But what's the difference between them, and how should they be used?\n\nThis article explains each of them with practical examples to help you better structure your styles using Tailwind.\n@layer base\n\n\n\nFor global resets and initial styles\nThis is the first layer loaded. Ideal for:\nResetting styles\nSetting global fonts\nBasic element styles like body, h1, button, etc.\n\n\n\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    @apply text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900;\n  }\n\n  body {\n     @apply bg-background text-foreground font-sans;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components\n\n\n\nFor reusable components (buttons, cards, badges, etc.)\nLoaded after base and before utilities. Perfect for blocks of combined utility classes:\n@layer components {\n  .btn {\n    @apply px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-md;\n  }\n\n  .card {\n    @apply shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 bg-white;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer utilities\n\n\n\nFor custom utilities\nThe last layer to load. Best used for specific, override-style utilities:\n@layer utilities {\n  .text-shadow {\n    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  }\n\n  .scrollbar-none {\n    scrollbar-width: none;\n    -ms-overflow-style: none;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer base        <- Global styles\n@layer components  <- Reusable components\n@layer utilities   <- Specific utilities (highest priority)\n\nUse each like this:\nbase: for tag resets and global defaults\ncomponents: for .btn, .card, .input, etc.\nutilities: for .text-shadow, .scroll-smooth, etc.\n@layer components {\n  .promo-price {\n    @apply text-purple-600 font-bold;\n  }\n\n  .add-button {\n    @apply px-4 py-1 bg-gray-200 rounded text-sm font-medium;\n  }\n}\n\nHave you been using them correctly?

          "description": "Angular's default style encapsulation prevents styles from leaking into or out of components. But sometimes, you want your component to adapt based on context provided by external elements, such as a dark class on the <body> element. This is where :host-context() comes in.\n:host-context()?\n\n\nThe :host-context() pseudo-class in Angular allows a component’s style to react to ancestor elements outside the component’s view encapsulation boundary.\nIt checks if the component is rendered inside an element matching the selector.\n:host-context(body.dark) {\n  .container {\n    background-color: #222;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n\nThis means: \"Apply this style if the component is somewhere inside a <body class='dark'>.\"\nTheming (e.g. light/dark mode)\nReacting to global classes or layout wrappers\nMaking components context-aware\n✅ :host-context() checks up the DOM tree, not down.\n✅ It works with Angular's default ViewEncapsulation.Emulated.\n❌ It does not work with ShadowDom encapsulation.\n❌ Do not repeat the context selector inside the rule block.\n:host {\n  .container {\n    background: white;\n    color: black;\n  }\n}\n\n:host-context(body.dark) {\n  .container {\n    background: black;\n    color: white;\n  }\n}\n\n// ❌ Incorrect\n:host-context(body.dark) {\n  .dark {\n    background: black;\n  }\n}\n\nThis is wrong because .dark is already in the selector. You don't need to repeat it.\nUse :host-context() to style Angular components based on their ancestors, such as when a global dark class is added to the <body> tag. It’s a powerful tool to make your components responsive to global layout or theming changes.",

Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.\nThe account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.\nAnother image posted by the account hacker shows what the caption claimed was Gokal’s wife holding up a driver’s license, while a …",

It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”\nSaylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.\n\nI asked @saylor if @MicroStrategy has any pla…",
