Mastering control flow allows developers to write efficient, logical, and maintainable code.\nBy default, JavaScript executes code from top to bottom, one line at a time. However, not all programs follow this linear path. Control flow statements enable the code to make decisions, repeat actions, or jump to different parts of the program depending on certain conditions.\nJavaScript provides several constructs to manage control flow:\nConditional statements allow a program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.\ncon‚Ä¶",
