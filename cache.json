          "description": "What is the DOM?\nThe DOM is a programming interface provided by the browser that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. Each element in an HTML document becomes a node (object) in this tree. JavaScript can use the DOM to access and manipulate HTML and CSS.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head><title>My Page</title></head>\n  <body>\n    <h1 id=\"title\">Hello, DOM!</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\n\nlet heading = document.getElementById(\"title\");\nheading.textContent = \"Welcome to JavaScript DOM!\";\n\n\nWhat Does the HTML DOM Look Like?\nImagine your webpage as a tree\nThe document is the root.\nHTML tags like , \n, and  are branches.\n\nAttributes, text, and other elements are the leaves.\nWhy is DOM Required?\nDynamic Content Updates: Without reloading the page, the DOM allows content updates (e.g…",

          "description": "Why RWAs aren’t the decentralized revolution you think they are\nTokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are the new crypto darling.\nEveryone’s hyped: BlackRock’s onchain, treasuries are getting wrapped, and traditional finance is flirting hard with blockchain.\nBut let’s not get it twisted: RWAs aren’t decentralization. They’re TradFi in a blockchain costume.\nHere’s the inconvenient truth:\nWant to buy tokenized real estate? Great. But that token doesn’t give you squat unless a legal entity off-chain honors it.\nTreasury tokens? Same thing. You’re trusting a fund manager, custodian, or regulatory body to redeem it.\nIt’s not trustless. It’s regulatory theater with a smart contract backend.\nRWAs are less about empowering users and more about navigating global compliance.\nIt’s not about breaking the system. It’s about bending the rules just enough to extract value while pretending to be futuristic.\nThis isn’t DeFi. It’s just TradFi with faster accounting.\nLet’s be honest: most RWA projects don’t need a blockchain. They use it for:\nToken issuance\nCap table management\nTracking asset flow\nBut these are things spreadsheets and CRMs have done for decades.\nPutting it onchain doesn’t make it revolutionary — it just makes it buzzword-compliant.\nWeb3 wasn’t about rehypothecating bonds or making banks more efficient. It was about disintermediation.\nCutting out the middlemen. Giving power back to users. Trustless systems.\nRWAs? They reintroduce the middlemen — they just wear hoodies now.\nTokenized RWAs sound sexy, but they’re just Wall Street playing dress-up in Web3.\nUntil these assets are truly decentralized — not just onchain — they’ll remain more TradFi than DeFi.",
