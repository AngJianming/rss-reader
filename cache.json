          "description": "Over the course of several years, I embarked on an ambitious solo journey to create a digital education business. What began as a simple idea evolved through multiple iterations—each one teaching me something about technology, process, and the nature of entrepreneurship itself. This is the story of that journey—from Katacoding to Sigmacasts to Octal Stream—and the insights I gained along the way.\nThe concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability. That realization led to Sigmacasts, a curated series of educational videos on math and computer science. The production process taught me how to craft educational narratives and use video to communicate abstract ideas.\nEventually, these …",

This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.\nHowever, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.\nThis highlights the importance of …",
