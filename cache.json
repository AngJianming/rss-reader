          "description": "In Go, the main goroutine often needs to wait for other goroutines to finish their tasks before continuing execution or exiting the program. This is a common requirement for concurrent synchronization. Go provides several mechanisms to achieve this, depending on the scenario and requirements.\nsync.WaitGroup is the most commonly used synchronization tool in Go, designed to wait for a group of goroutines to finish their tasks. It works through a counter mechanism and is especially suitable when the main goroutine needs to wait for multiple sub-goroutines.\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"sync\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    var wg sync.WaitGroup\n\n    // Start 3 goroutines\n    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {\n        wg.Add(1) // Increment the counter by 1\n        go func(id int) {\n            defer wg.D…",

AI Agents are the next step forward: dynamic, decision-making programs that don’t just wait for commands, but act on their own. Think of them as the proactive employees in your digital company.\nThere are a few types you’ll bump into:\nReactive agents: Wait for commands, like glorified APIs.\nProactive agents: Sense what’s going on and make the first move. Your smart fridge that tells you you’re out of milk? That’s one.\nAutonomous agents: Navigate complex environments solo. Hello, driverless cars.\nHere’s how a basic one might look in Python:\nclass SmartAgent:\n    def __init__(self, temp):\n        self.temp = temp\n\n    def decide(self):\n        if self.temp > 25:\n            return \"Turn on the fan.…",
