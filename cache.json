          "description": "TL;DR: Fantasy and romance authors Lena McDonald, K.C. Crowne and Rania Faris are under fire after fans spotted raw ChatGPT prompt responses sneaking into their finished novels. Screenshots on Bluesky and Reddit reveal lines like “Thought for 13 seconds…” and “This can be tightened…” smack in the middle of published text—sparking accusations of theft and lazy writing. McDonald’s even accused of yanking another author’s style wholesale, while readers have been review-bombing their books to teach them a lesson.  \nWhat happened next: Crowne quietly owned up, claiming AI was only for “minor edits” and pledging her voice hasn’t been compromised. Faris first blamed a beta reader, then backpedaled and never showed proof. McDonald hasn’t publicly explained herself, and fans aren’t letting up—demanding accountability and pledging to stick to the human touch.",

The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.”\n“Look, I don't know anything abo…",
