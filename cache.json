          "description": "What is Abstraction?\n\n\nAbstraction is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle that means hiding internal details(or complexities) and exposing only essential parts to the end users. Think of it like using a TV remote ‚Äî you press a button to switch channels, but you don‚Äôt need to understand the circuitry behind it.\nIn code, abstraction helps keep things clean, maintainable, and secure. Users interact with simple methods, while complex logic stays away.\nAbstraction is one of the four pillars of OOP, along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It helps with:\nSimplicity: It hides unnecessary complexity.\nSecurity: Sensitive logic or data can be kept private.\nMaintainability: Internal changes don‚Äôt affect users of the class.\nReusability: You can reuse the same interface acros‚Ä¶",

The client wanted insights‚Äîtotal revenue by category, monthly user activity, and top contributors. I thought simple .find() queries with some frontend filtering would do the job. I was wrong.\nPagination was slow, filtering was clunky, and combining multiple collections felt like reinventing SQL joins in JavaScript. That‚Äôs when I realized the real power of MongoDB wasn‚Äôt just in storing JSON-like data‚Äîit was in how you transform that data.
