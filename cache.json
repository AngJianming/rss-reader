These allow you to format or transform data when retrieving or saving it to the database. With Laravel 12, the syntax for defining accessors and mutators has been updated to make it more concise and intuitive.\nIn this article, we’ll explore how to format dates using accessors and mutators with the new syntax introduced in Laravel 12.\nAccessors: Modify how an attribute is retrieved from the database.\n\n\nMutators: Modify how an attribute is stored in the database.\nFor example, you can use an accessor to format a date when retrieving it and a mutator to ensure the date is stored in a specific format.\nLet’s say you have a User model with a birth_date column.

Instead of writing code, developers form \"vibes\" or intentions, which AI translates into a working application. This opens up new possibilities for creativity and faster development.\n💡 How Does Vibe Coding Work?\nInstead of coding with lines of code, the developer conveys a system of intentions—such as “create a button with this functionality” or “build a screen with these data.” The AI, trained on a large dataset of examples, can interpret the intentions and generate all necessary code and interface components to carry out the task.
