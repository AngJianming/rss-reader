After seeing the AI headshot market explode, I noticed a common complaint: you'd pay for 100 images just to get a handful of good ones.\nI knew I could do better by focusing on model quality and prompting. So, I challenged myself to build and launch a high-quality alternative from scratch in just two weeks.\nToday, I‚Äôm excited to share that I launched Smart Headshots AI.\nFrontend: Next.js (love the performance)\nBackend: Supabase for everything - auth, database, storage\nUI: Kept it dead simple internally, went all-out on the landing page using shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS\nPayments: Switched to Dodo Payments (MOR) after hearing too many Stripe horror stories\n‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\nLike many of you, I often work on several microservices at once. I found myself needing a straightforward way to centralize my application logs without the overhead of setting up a full ELK/EFK stack or paying for a third-party service, especially for smaller projects or internal tools.\nSo, I decided to build my own simple, two-part solution and I've just open-sourced it. I'm sharing it today in the hope that it might be useful to others and to get some feedback from this amazing community.\nThe solution consists of two separate projects:\nlog-sense-logback-appender\nThis is a custom Logback appender packaged as a Spring Boot starter. The idea is to make integration dead simple.\nWhat it does: It automatically hooks into your logging system and sends log events as structured JSON (including MDC properties and stack traces) to an HTTP endpoint.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense-logback-appender\nHere‚Äôs how easy the configuration is in any service you want to monitor:\nProperties\nlogsense.appender.enabled=true\nhttp://localhost:8080/api/logs\nlogsense-server\nThis is the other half of the duo. It‚Äôs a simple Spring Boot application that acts as the collector.\nWhat it does: It runs a lightweight server with a single REST endpoint (/api/logs) that listens for the JSON payloads sent by the appender.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense\nI'd love your feedback!\nWhat do you think of this approach for simple, centralized logging?\nAre there any obvious pitfalls or security concerns I might have overlooked?\nWhat features would you consider essential for a V2? (e.g., batching log sends, authentication, a simple query UI?)\nThanks for taking the time to check it out!",
