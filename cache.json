          "description": "When an AI generates a significant portion of your application, who truly \"developed\" it? This isn't a new dilemma – generative artists faced similar questions about authorship when their algorithms created art.\nI've been diving into the fascinating parallels between generative art and the world of \"generative code\". It's less about who holds the brush (or types the line) and more about who crafts the vision, orchestrates the system, and curates the output. Our \"signature\" as coders is evolving.\nWant to explore how our role is shifting from syntax masters to narrative architects in this AI-driven landscape?\nDive into the full article on my blog: https://goker.me/generative-code-who-is-the-artist\nHow do you see authorship and creativity changing with generative code tools?",

          "description": "Hey folks,\nI wanted to share something YoSev and I built over the past few months: it’s called FFmate — an open-source automation tool for FFmpeg, written in Go.\nWe built it because we were tired of hacking together scripts every time we needed to automate FFmpeg workflows. Jobs piling up, inconsistent filenames, watchfolders that needed babysitting — you probably know the deal. So we decided to create something that could actually handle all of that in a more elegant way, without reinventing the wheel every time.\nHere’s what FFmate does so far:\nManages FFmpeg jobs with a built-in queue\nLets you use wildcards to generate clean, structured output paths\nSends webhook notifications so you can hook it into other parts of your workflow\nWatches folders and automatically kicks off tasks\nSupports custom pre- and post-processing scripts\nComes with a bunch of ready-to-use FFmpeg presets out of the box\nHas a simple web UI to keep track of everything\nYou can run it locally, in the cloud, or in a Docker container — whatever works best for you.\nWe just released it and figured it might be useful to others dealing with the same FFmpeg pain points. It’s open-source (AGPL-3), and we’d genuinely love any feedback, ideas, or contributions.\nWebsite: ffmate.io\n\n\nGitHub: github.com/welovemedia/ffmate\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/NzfeHn37jT\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever spent too much time wrestling with FFmpeg automation — we’d love to hear what you’ve built, what you wish existed, or where FFmate could help.\nRafa",

No!\nChanging from React to Next.js is not like demolishing your old house and building a new one. You can slowly, slowly make changes. Your React knowledge is still useful, it's the base.

Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.\nParadoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise.

To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.\nSemler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.\nSemler Scientific share price. Source: Google Finance\nIn its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.\nBitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.\nMichael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin.
