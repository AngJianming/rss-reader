We basically had to rebuild the project from scratch to support new business rules and migrate our database from NoSQL to SQL ‚Äî all without affecting the production environment experience.\nOur CI/CD pipeline includes automated analysis with SonarQube to catch bugs, vulnerabilities, duplicated code, test coverage, and more.\nUp to that point ‚Äî everything‚Äôs great!\nBut then‚Ä¶ the pipeline started failing a few times due to unit test coverage falling below the expected 70% threshold.\nThe problem? The uncovered areas included things like DbContext, repository classes, and even some domain entities ‚Äî areas that, according to best practices, shouldn't be the main focus of unit testing.\nThe danger of chasing high test coverage at all costs is that you end up testing things outside of your business logic ‚Äî like framework behavior, library internals, and implementation details that are likely to change.\n‚úÖ Focus on testing what matters: the behavior and rules of your business.\nCode with purpose. Test with strategy. Deploy with confidence.\nüëâ Here‚Äôs an article where Martin Fowler explains this much better:\nhttps://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html",
