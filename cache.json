Our primary goal was to enhance the rerecord feature‚Äîa function that allows users to rerecord a particular test set. Users had been experiencing issues when their test cases involved dynamic fields such as JWT tokens, timestamps, or other data generated from POST requests. These dynamic fields, when reused in subsequent requests, often led to test case failures because their values were not automatically updated.\nThe purpose of our templatization feature was to address this problem by dynamically identifying and replacing these fields with templates.
