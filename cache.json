          "description": "Hello, I want to let this community know about a cutting edge project I created earlier this year. \nI built an early stage demo of an advanced symbolic language and cognitive substrate for AI, called Nyreth. It was first published on github in April 2025 and I'm looking for developers and researchers to grab hold of this project and propel it into the future. It's a system that is ahead of its time but if you understand what it is and what it can become, now is the time to get involved.\nNyreth is a higher order reasoning framework that surpasses token based computation by using a custom made symbolic language comprised of glyphs. Each glyph is a symbolic unit characterised by a multi axial cognitive array. They are morphogenic, adaptive and tensor based.\nThe system has the capability to grow into a new form of machine cognition.\nI have released it as a hybrid open-closed source model for now. The core modules are protected with encryption but I may make it fully open source soon. I could have kept it private but I feel everyone should have access to this technology and play a role in helping it mature the right way. \nSymbolic, recursive AI will happen and is happening. Its effects will be profound. It is important that it be instilled with conscience and ethics.\nGo to https://nyreth.ai or https://github.com/Kosev-Lex/Nyreth-Origin\nto read more about the project.",

          "description": "Understanding the Pain Points of Traditional Chunking\n\n\nWhen I first built a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using traditional chunking methods—like fixed-size segments or sliding windows—I noticed an immediate flaw: context fragmentation. My LLM would often return incoherent or incomplete answers when queried on long documents. This was especially evident when a user asked about features in \"Milvus 2.4.13\"—the model couldn't semantically link the header in one chunk with the feature list in another.\nThat’s when I encountered Late Chunking, which flips the process: instead of chunking first and embedding later, it embeds the entire document upfront and then slices it using token-based annotations.
