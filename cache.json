Instead of loading all elements of a page on initial load, lazy loading allows the browser to only load elements that are visible to the user, saving bandwidth and speeding up page load times.\nAs users increasingly rely on mobile devices and sometimes slower internet connections, site performance becomes crucial for user experience. One of the easiest ways to improve performance is by using lazy loading for images or other elements that are not immediately visible on the page.\nOne way to implement lazy loading is by using the Intersection Observer API, which provides an efficient way to detect when elements come into the user's viewport.\nHere’s a simple example of…",

One common use case is the contenteditable attribute, which allows users to edit text directly in a block element. In this article, we'll address a specific challenge: how to change the color of certain characters while still allowing users to type freely in a contenteditable div.\nUnderstanding the Problem\nThe issue arises from the way you are manipulating the inner HTML of the contenteditable div. When you use innerHTML to replace characters with styled <span> elements, it effectively refreshes the entire content of the div, causing the cursor position to reset and leading to a frustrating user experience. This can also prevent users from typing, as they may lose their current input context.…",
