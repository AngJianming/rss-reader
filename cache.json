          "description": "Hey everyone 👋\nI’m a 2023 Computer Science graduate. I started off as a backend developer at a startup, but due to financial needs, I later took up a non-tech role at Amazon. Tried switching internally — didn’t work out.\nLike many, I turned to DSA prep to get back into tech, but it’s super competitive out there. Recently, I discovered Salesforce and it really caught my interest. It’s technical, structured, and I like that it’s tied to solving real business problems.\nThe only concern? I’ve been hearing that Salesforce roles are becoming saturated, especially for freshers or newcomers trying to break in.\nI genuinely love working with technology, regardless of the platform. Just trying to figure out if Salesforce is a smart move at this point or if I should continue focusing on traditional dev paths.\nIf you’ve made the switch or know someone who did, I’d really appreciate your thoughts!\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

          "description": "Great! You're learning JavaScript, especially about local variables and the DOM (Document Object Model)—those are essential concepts in web development.\nHere's a simple blog-style explanation to help reinforce your learning:\nIn JavaScript, a local variable is a variable that is declared inside a function or block, and it can only be used within that function or block.\nfunction greet() {\n    let message = \"Hello, world!\";\n    console.log(message);\n}\n\ngreet(); // Outputs: Hello, world!\nconsole.log(message); // ❌ Error! 'message' is not defined outside the function\n\nlet message = \"Hello, world!\" is a local variable, so you cannot use it outside the greet() function.\nDOM stands for Document Object Model. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects in JavaScript.\nWith the DOM, you can:\nRead or change content\nChange styles (CSS)\nAdd or remove HTML elements\n<p id=\"demo\">Original Text</p>\n<button onclick=\"changeText()\">Click Me</button>\n\n<script>\nfunction changeText() {\n    let element = document.getElementById(\"demo\");\n    element.innerHTML = \"Text has been changed!\";\n}\n</script>\n\nWhen the button is clicked:\nJavaScript finds the <p> tag with id=\"demo\"\n\nChanges its content to \"Text has been changed!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  🛠️ Why It Matters\n\n\n\n\nLocal variables help avoid bugs by keeping variables where they belong.\nThe DOM lets you make web pages interactive—like showing messages, changing colors, or responding to clicks.\nWould you like a small project to practice with these concepts?",
