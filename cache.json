          "description": "No one is really for it. We all know it's not the best way to work. It’s that moment you stop thinking and just let the AI take over.\nYour expertise can take a hit.\ni’ve felt it myself. When i vibe-code too much, i start to trust my own knowledge less. Even if i know the answer, i find myself checking with an AI.\nit's like when i wanted to get stronger at the gym. i had to go and actually lift the weights, not just read about lifting theory. If you let the AI do all the lifting, you don’t build any muscle.\nAI agents are getting better.\nNew tools are coming that can write and fix code by themselves. This means we'll be looking at the actual code less and less.\nAnd let's be honest, chat is not a great way to talk to an AI for coding. Startups are already building better ways for us to work with them.\nBut AI will not replace you.\nAn AI can't come up with a new idea on its own. It needs a prompt.\nThink about talking to a customer. They might forget a key detail because to them, it's obvious. It’s our job to figure that out and translate it into formal, structured code. The same thing happens when we prompt an AI, and the same thing would happen if an AI prompted itself. That’s where we, as developers, come in.\nWhat this all means for developers.\nIt's going to be less about how many programming languages you know by heart. It's going to be more about how well you understand what your clients and customers actually need.\nSo, if you're already in IT, start playing with these new AI tools. Get a feel for them.\nAnd if you're thinking about getting into IT, this is a great time to start. The barrier to entry is changing.\nFor a good place to start learning, check out my YouTube channel.

Despite record-fast early player acquisition, the game never reached critical mass due to “very little marketing,” crippling tech debt in the Snowdrop engine, and unsolvable netcode issues that tanked multiplayer reliability.\nRubin praised his team’s “fun, terrific” maps and teased unrealized Season 4 features, but admitted they lacked the resources to fix fundamental engine flaws. He now plans to spend more time with family—while hoping someone else picks up the flag to push modern multiplayer forward without resorting to microtransaction overload and punishing skill-based matchmaking.",

          "description": "Swedish business paper Dagens Industri revealed that Tencent quietly scooped up a 15.75 % stake in Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios back in July 2024, paying about $83 million and valuing the Stockholm studio at roughly SEK 5.1 billion (~$532 million). Arrowhead rode Helldivers 2’s success—12 million copies sold in three months, fastest-selling PlayStation Studios title—to chalk up SEK 959 million (~$100 million) in profit (SEK 729 million operating profit) last year.\n\n\nArrowhead’s co-founder Johan Pilestedt calls the Chinese player base “the holy grail,” and sees Tencent’s backing as massive economic leverage. Details on how deeply Tencent will be involved remain sketchy—Arrowhead insists its next game will be 100 % self-funded and not a PlayStation publishing deal—but the studio’s already got a passionate Chinese community (even China’s U.S. embassy tweeted about their in-game heroics).",
