Today, the most effective creators build bridges, connecting their work to established communities across multiple platforms. Relying on a single platform can create a digital echo chamber, where your work only reaches those who already know you. This approach severely limits growth and discovery.\nThe primary benefit of multi-platform publishing is tapping into the built-in audiences of established sites. Platforms like Medium or LinkedIn already have millions of active readers searching for quality content. By sharing your work there, you place it directly in their path, which helps to increase article visibility far more quickly than a standalone blog ever could. It’…",
