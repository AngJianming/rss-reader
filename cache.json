But soon, you start hearing terms like VAT, GST, chargebacks, and tax compliance, and things get complicated.\nThat's when the term \"Merchant of Record\" (MoR) starts to appear.\nIf you sell globally, the MoR model can either simplify your operations or cause unexpected issues. Most payment providers don't clearly explain this. Stripe and Paddle might seem like similar checkout options, but legally and operationally, they're completely different.\nIn this post, we'll clearly explain what a Merchant of Record is, how it affects your business, and whether you should use a platform like Paddle or Lemon Squeezy instead of Stripe.

          "description": "NVIDIA has just announced native support for Python in its CUDA platform, marking a major shift in how developers can access GPU acceleration. For the first time, Python developers can write CUDA programs without needing to rely on C or C++ bindings. This native integration drastically lowers the barrier for using GPUs in scientific computing, AI, and data-heavy Python applications.\nThe new cuda-python package gives direct access to CUDA’s driver and runtime APIs, letting users launch kernels, manage memory, and control streams entirely from Python. It also includes support for just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which means you can write dynamic GPU code directly in Python, compile it on the fly, and run it immediately.\nA key innovation is the new CuTile programming model, which brings a tile-based structure to CUDA operations. CuTile is designed to feel natural to Python users familiar with NumPy and CuPy, and it allows for efficient manipulation of large data arrays without needing to manage threads manually.\nThis move brings CUDA closer to Python’s ecosystem and could reshape how GPU computing is taught, deployed, and scaled across AI and HPC workloads.\nRead the full announcement here:\nhttps://thenewstack.io/nvidia-finally-adds-native-python-support-to-cuda/\nOfficial documentation from NVIDIA:\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python",

After over a year of updates in the React 18.x line, React 19 solidifies the groundwork with innovations aimed at simplifying component logic, improving server-side rendering, and streamlining form handling.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the most important features of React 19 and how they impact modern frontend development.\n🔥 1. Actions for Forms: Server-first Data Mutations\n✅ Benefits:\nServer and client logic remain in sync.\nSimplifies the mental model for forms.\n🧪 Example:\nexport async function createPost(formData) {\nCreate Post\n🧠 2. useOptimistic: Better UX for Async Updates\n🚀 Use Case:\n💡 Example:\n{\n    addOptimisticTodo({ title: inputValue });\n🔄 3. useFormStatus and useFormState: Form Helpers\nuseFormStatus\njsx\njsx\n🌐 4. Improved Server Components\n💼 Key Benefits:\nImproved initial load performance.\nEnhanced support in Next.js App Router and other frameworks.\n📦 5. Asset Loading with \nWhy it matters:\nNative  support in JSX means tighter integration with the browser's preload pipeline.\njsx\n🧹 7. Cleanup and Breaking Changes\nLegacy context API (pre-React 16.3) is fully removed.\nReactDOM.render is now replaced with createRoot.\nBetter error boundaries and async rendering behavior.\n📈 Final Thoughts\nWhether you're building SPAs or full-stack apps with frameworks like Next.js or Remix, React 19 is ready to supercharge your developer experience.\n🙌 Ready to Migrate?\nReact 19 is now stable, and most major frameworks have either added or are adding support. Start experimenting today, especially with server actions and useFormState, to see the benefits in real-time.",
