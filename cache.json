Muitas vezes, também queremos renderizar essas informações com componentes personalizados e, ao mesmo tempo, manter a funcionalidade de filtros da tabela.

          "description": "Regular expressions (regex) are one of those tools that can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. While they might look like someone sneezed on a keyboard, regex patterns are incredibly powerful for text processing, validation, and data extraction. Let's dive deep into the world of regex and explore how to harness their full potential.\nRegular expressions are sequences of characters that define search patterns. They're used across programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools to find, match, and manipulate strings. Think of them as a sophisticated \"find and replace\" tool on steroids.\nOne of the most common uses of regex is validating email addresses:\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n\nThis pattern ensures the email has a valid structure with chara…",

It’s a great way for me to deepen my understanding of backend development and Rails as a framework.\nWith my internship starting on June 18, I am super excited about the upcoming journey.

With its grid of rows and columns, Excel enables users to perform calculations, visualize trends, and create reports that support data-driven decision-making. Its flexibility and functionality make it useful across industries, from finance and marketing to education and research.\nReal-World Applications of Excel\n1. Business Decision Making\n2. Financial Reporting\n3. Marketing Analysis\nKey Excel Features and Uses\n1. PivotTables\n2. VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP\n3. Conditional Formatting\nPersonal Reflection\nLearning Excel changed how I approach data. I used to see numbers as just static values. Now, I see them as a way to uncover stories and make informed choices. One of my first projects was a personal budget tracker. As I added formulas and charts, I started spotting trends—like overspending. That experience made me more thoughtful about how I manage information. Excel has not only helped me analyze data but also built my confidence in using it to solve real problems. It's a skill I will be using in school, work, and everyday life.",
