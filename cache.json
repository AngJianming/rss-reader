          "description": "When managing Gradle projects, particularly those involving Kotlin, it's common to encounter the scenario where both a Gradle plugin and a dependency rely on the same version number. The question arises: how can you define a single variable that is accessible for both a plugin and a dependency in your build.gradle file?\nWhy This Issue Occurs\nGradle creates different scopes for different parts of the build configuration. The buildscript block is used to define classpath dependencies for the Gradle build itself, and variables defined there (like ext.kotlinVersion) aren't directly accessible in the dependencies block. This can lead to redundancy if the same version number needs to be specified in multiple places.\nTo overcome this limitation and avoid repetitive definitions, Kotlin users can f…",

As Swift developers, we deal with data every day, and the conversion between JSON and models is undoubtedly a daily task. Apple provided us with the Codable protocol, which performs well in many situations, but as business logic becomes more complex, we often find ourselves stuck writing a lot of boilerplate code: manually defining CodingKeys, implementing init(from:) and encode(to:), handling nested structures, dealing with different naming styles, parsing various date formats...
