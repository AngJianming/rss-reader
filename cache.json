          "description": "Introduction\nWhen developing a game in OpenGL, you may encounter a myriad of issues, particularly when it comes to collision detection. One common issue is related to ray intersection tests with triangles when box collision is enabled. You may find that your triangle ray intersection code works correctly without additional collision logic but fails as soon as you introduce box collision checks. In this article, we will explore why this happens and how you can resolve it.\nUnderstanding the Issue\nThe interplay between different types of collision detection methods, such as box and triangle collisions, can lead to unexpected behavior in your game logic. In the provided code snippet, the triangle ray intersection logic stops working when an additional conditional check related to box collision‚Ä¶",
