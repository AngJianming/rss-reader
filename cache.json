In this guide, we‚Äôll cover the basics and advanced use cases of type casting and provide some clarity on casting vs. assertion. TypeScript's robust type system lets developers define and enforce types for variables, function parameters, return values, and more. \nEssentially, it does static type checking, and this helps catch and prevent many errors before the code even runs. But let's be honest, type-related issues can still surprise us, especially when dealing with data that's unpredictable.
