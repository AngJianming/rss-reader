So, when I heard about the Advanced LLM Agents MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) offered by UC Berkeley, featuring lectures from leading researchers, I knew I had to dive in. The promise of learning from the architects of tomorrow's AI, like Prof. Dawn Song and a host of industry pioneers, was too good to pass up.

They're everywhere. You just don’t hear about them because no one brags about them. But they make money.\nKenn decided to jump in and throw his status around, asking for proof, acting like that kind of thing doesn’t happen.\nI responded calmly, explaining how I’ve been building AI-assisted systems myself, integrating Firebase, procedural logic, and even using Unity just to output animations — but doing the actual gameplay engine in JavaScript for speed and performance.\nAnd what happened next?\nHe blocked me.\nHere's his page if you're curious who got cooked:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/kennwhite/\nWhat’s Funny About It\nThey’re not fancy. They just work.\nAnd I’m trying to build the same kind of systems, just with my style, my identity.\n\n\nTL;DR\nMight turn the whole thing into a dev.to series on indie game engines and procedural mobile development with Firebase + JS.\n—Tyler",

Even a 15-minute sync at 11:30 AM can ruin an entire productive morning.\nHalf the time, the same question could be resolved in 3 Slack messages or a Loom video.\nThe more people in the call — the less productive it usually is.\nAnd most importantly:\nMore meetings ≠ more alignment.\n\nOften, they’re a symptom of unclear specs, weak async culture, or trust issues.\nHere’s what has worked for me (and the teams I’ve led):\nWrite clearer tickets. Record short Loom videos. Share architecture ideas in Notion or GitHub Issues.\nNot every engineer, PM, and designer needs to be in every call.\nAsk: “Can this be a doc?” → If yes, make a doc.\n\nAsk: “Do I really need live feedback?” → If not, write it up.\nWhen developers are trusted to make technical decisions and document them, calls become rare and more impactful.\nDon’t get me wrong — I’ve had great technical calls.\n\nCollaborative design sessions, real-time debugging, or architecture whiteboarding can be amazing. But they should be the exception — not the default.\nIf you're in meetings all day and wondering why you're shipping less — this might be your answer.\nHow many technical calls do you have each week?\nHow many of them could be async?\nWhat helps your team reduce meeting overload?\nLet’s share ideas below 💬",
