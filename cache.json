Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have emerged as critical technology powering the Internet. But what exactly are CDNs, and why have they become essential to our online experience?\nA Content Delivery Network is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of internet content. By placing servers at strategic locations worldwide, CDNs bring content closer to users, significantly reducing the time it takes to load websites, stream videos, or download files.\nThink of a CDN like a network of ATMs. Instead of traveling across town to withdraw money from a single bank location (which would create long lines and delays), ATMs are placed on nearly every corner, ‚Ä¶",

Para isso, execute os dois comandos abaixo:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y build-essential libpcre3 libpcre3-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev wget\n2) Baixe o c√≥digo-fonte do Nginx\nAcesse ao endere√ßo https://nginx.org/en/download.html e baixe a vers√£o mais est√°vel do NGINX. Em seguida, descompacte o arquivo baixado.\n3) Compile o Nginx\nPara compilar o Nginx, execute os tr√™s comandos abaixo:\nConfigure o processo de compila√ß√£o:\n./configure --sbin-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx --conf-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx.conf --pid-path=/usr/local/nginx/nginx.pid\nCompile o c√≥digo-fonte:\nmake\nInstale o Nginx:\nsudo make install\n4) Levante suas aplica√ß√µes que ser√£o usadas no Gateway\nNo exemplo deste cen√°rio, foram levantadas duas aplica√ß√µes:\nhttp://localhost:3001\nhttp://localhost:3002\n5) Configue da forma como deseja\nEdite o arquivo \"/usr/local/nginx/nginx.conf\". No exemplo abaixo foram configurados:\nPorta do Nginx √© a 8081, portanto ser√° digitado no navegador o endere√ßo \"http://localhost:8081\"\nDois endpoints \"myapp1\" e \"myapp2\", em que cada um deles ser√° endere√ßado para aplica√ß√µes/endere√ßos diferentes\n\n6) Inicie o Nginx\nsudo /usr/local/nginx/nginx\nObs.: Quando quiser parar o Nginx, execute o comando abaixo:\nsudo kill -QUIT $(cat /usr/local/nginx/nginx.pid)",

No one warns you, but Apple still expects you to comply.\nThis comes from D√©cret n¬∞2007-663 ‚Äî a French regulation that classifies basic cryptographic usage (like SSL/TLS) as ‚Äúmeans of cryptology.‚Äù\nIf you don‚Äôt file the required documents with ANSSI, your app can get blocked or delayed.\nTechnically, you need to:\nFill out a 6-page declaration form (in French)\nAttach detailed technical descriptions of your app‚Äôs crypto functions\nEmail it manually to the French government (ANSSI) before launch\nHope it‚Äôs accepted without requiring revisions\nMost devs find out about this only when they want to launch.\nRather than spend hours digging through French legal forms, you can now generate the full required documentation automatically.\nI built Nova Store to handle this.\nSubmit it directly to ANSSI without worrying about legal mistakes\nIt saves hours of time - and helps you avoid customs or compliance issues down the line.",
