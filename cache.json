Yet, there’s a persistent and costly problem: most AI projects never make it past the proof-of-concept (POC) phase.\nAccording to Gartner, only 53% of AI models are successfully deployed into production, leaving the majority of efforts stuck in isolated experimentation. The result? Wasted investment, disillusioned stakeholders, and missed opportunities.\nWhy does this gap persist—and more importantly, how can enterprises bridge it?\nIn this blog, we break down the critical journey from proof of concept (POC) to scalable AI deployment.

With AWS introducing Agentic AI capabilities through services like Agents for Amazon Bedrock, developers now have intelligent assistants that don’t just generate code, but understand workflows, take context-aware actions, and interact with services—all based on natural language prompts.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how Agentic AI on AWS is shaping the future of coding and how developers can start using it today.\nWhat is Agentic AI?\nOn AWS, this is enabled through Agents for Amazon Bedrock, where developers can build and deploy agents that:\nUnderstand goals through prompts or APIs\nUse built-in tools or custom functions\nCall AWS services (like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)\nGenerate intelligent, contextual responses\nHow Is Agentic AI Useful for Developers?\n🔧1. Automate Repetitive DevOps Tasks\n🧠 2. Context-Aware Code Generation\n⚙️ 3. Smart API Orchestration\nCreating an S3 bucket\nUploading files\nNotifying users on completion\nAll with a single prompt or API call.\n🔍 4. Real-Time Troubleshooting Assistant\n📈 5. Streamline Business Logic\nReal Example:Build an Agent for DevOps Tasks\nAccepts a prompt like: \"Deploy a test environment in us-east-1 with EC2 and RDS\"\nInvokes backend Lambda functions\nDeploys infrastructure via CloudFormation or SDK\nResponds with a success or error message\nWith just a few lines of configuration and access to your functions, it acts like a smart DevOps engineer.\nHow to Get Started \nEnable Amazon Bedrock in your AWS account.\nDefine an Agent using the AWS console or CLI.\nCreate Action Groups to link your backend Lambda functions.\nSecure your agent with IAM permissions.\nInvoke via API or UI—from your app, CLI, or test UI.\nFinal Thoughts\nSo go ahead—build your first agent.

A strong internal link structure helps bots and users navigate your content better.\n✅ Write for people, optimize for search  Don’t sacrifice natural flow just for keywords. Google's getting better at detecting authenticity.\n✅ Community participation  passive SEO  Places like DEV, Reddit, Quora, or niche forums offer authority-building opportunities without being spammy.\nI’d love to hear what’s been working for others in SEO lately — drop your insights or tools in the comments!\nThanks for reading 🙌\nSamuel Miz",

Rumors began circulating in February.\nSource: GameStop\nShares of GameStop (GME) stock climbed amid the speculation, jumping 12% in March. The February speculation fueled an 18% spike in GME stock prices.\nAccording to TradingView, GameStop shares closed at $35 on May 27 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market at the time of publication. The stock is up around 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of roughly 10%.\nThis is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.\nMagazine: Bitcoin vs. the quantum computer threat: Timeline and solutions (2025–2035)",
