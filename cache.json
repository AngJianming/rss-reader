Configure fine-grained access policies to protect sensitive applications.\nWhile cryptographic implementation is generally on the application side, SafeLine can enforce HTTPS and block insecure protocols to prevent the exploitation of cryptographic weaknesses.\n\nSafeLine's semantic analysis engine accurately detects SQL injection, command injection, and other malicious payloads, blocking them in real time without relying solely on regex.\n\nSafeLine supports custom allow/deny‚Ä¶",

Somethings which would be as easy as hello world in some other language or runtime - it would be near impossible to implement in node js espically due to it's single threaded nature. Go on the other hand comes with built in support for multithreading.\nI had been tackling an issue where I needed to synchronize my database with a CRM database which had strict limit on how many API requests I could make per 5 secs. I tried everything from shifting framework (Node to Nest), tried using event driven architecture with REDIS as transport, and tried using BullMQ. But nothing worked; I needed my application to run 24/7 and keep data in sync - node just couldn't do it. It lacks alot in this domain due to it's internal acrhecture. \n\nGo on other hand had shined here - it came with built in support for background jobs running on multiple threads. I could make 100s to 1000s of background jobs using go routines on same machine where I could barely run 3 or 4 in node js. Go allowed me to run the application 24/7 without any downtime - yes I mean any. Not once was heap memory full or some other internal issue. \nBut even go had it's downside. Not a lot of community support espically in niched areas. I had to build a lot of stuff which is easy to implement in node js by installing third party libraries. \nif anyone has worked or is working on API polling database's, or similar task - I would love to connect with you",
