          "description": "Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîtrust account audits aren‚Äôt exactly the highlight of an accountant‚Äôs year.\nIf you're managing funds on behalf of clients in your accounting practice‚Äîyes, you do.\nIt depends on when the account was opened.\nIf it was opened after 1 July 2011, the audit period is 12 months from the end of the month in which the account was opened.\nThe audit report must be completed within 3 months of the period end date. Don‚Äôt wait until the last minute‚Äîit‚Äôs one of the biggest traps firms fall into.\nCheck the Accountant Trust Account Audit Service\nNot just anyone with ‚Äúauditor‚Äù in their email signature.\nHas a financial interest in your business.\nMight be seen as lacking independence.\nEven if the auditor ticks all the boxes technically, perceived conflicts of interest can still disqualify them.\nIt‚Äôs not something you want on your professional record.\naudits?\nNot separating trust funds properly: Mixing trust and operational funds is a big no-no.\nLate audits: Procrastination is common, but it can backfire fast.\nPoor record-keeping: If your files are all over the place, your audit will be too.\nUsing an ineligible auditor: This one catches a lot of firms off guard.\nThe key takeaway? Stay organised, stay on top of deadlines, and work with a qualified auditor who knows what they‚Äôre doing.\nHere‚Äôs where it gets interesting.\nIt depends on your firm‚Äôs size, expertise, and bandwidth.\nTrust account audits don‚Äôt have to be painful.\nWith the right planning, the right auditor, and a solid understanding of the rules, your firm can breeze through audit season without breaking a sweat. Knowing what to expect‚Äîand what can go wrong‚Äîis half the battle.\nSo whether you‚Äôre preparing your own audit or helping clients meet their compliance obligations, keeping this advice in your back pocket will save you stress, time, and possibly a call from your professional body.\nStill unsure? Don‚Äôt wing it. Speak to an audit specialist early. A 10-minute chat now could save you weeks of hassle later.",

There‚Äôs no clear roadmap, and the process can leave you feeling lost, alone, or left behind.\nThat‚Äôs why I‚Äôve started building www.spectrumconnect.eu with Lovable.dev ‚Äî a free app designed for parents of autistic children. Here‚Äôs what it aims to do:\nüìÜ Track important dates and applications (like SNA reviews or therapy appointments)\nüó∫Ô∏è Provide simple, guided steps to help families understand where they are in the process\nü§ù Connect with trusted professionals\nüìë Store and access important documents easily\nüíô Most importantly, help parents feel seen and supported\nI‚Äôm not a developer by trade ‚Äî I‚Äôve taught myself as much as I can, and I‚Äôm using Supabase as the backend. But now, I‚Äôm at the stage where I really need some experienced developer support to bring this vision fully to life.\nAre you a developer who knows React, TypeScript, or Supabase?\n\nWould you be willing to dedicate a few hours a week as a volunteer to help build something meaningful for families like mine?\nThis is a volunteer project. I‚Äôm committed to keeping it 100% free for parents ‚Äî no ads, no fees, ever.\nIf this resonates with you, please DM me! After a chat, I‚Äôd be happy to invite you to the GitHub repo, Lovable.dev environment, or Supabase project ‚Äî whatever‚Äôs most useful for you.\nThank you for reading, and for believing in a more supportive future for our children.\nüåà Project Link (still in development)\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  opensource #volunteer #react #typescript #supabase #autism #neurodiversity #parenting #autismsupport #dublin #ireland #socialimpact #techforgood #developers #caregivers #hse #sna #carersrights #autismparents #lovabledev",
