          "description": "Often, blinded by our own perception of wisdom, we risk falling into stubbornness. When we assume our view of our goals is absolute and refuse to adapt to changing circumstances, new knowledge, or lived experience, we are not showing firmness or resolve — we are revealing ignorance and obstinacy.\nTruly Recognizing the Path\n\n\nFirmness is a vital virtue for persistence. It holds us steady in uncertainty, gives us strength to withstand obstacles, and helps us stay focused when everything around us tries to pull us off course. It’s a powerful tool on the path to any goal, because it brings direction. No serious pursuit can exist without some measure of firmness; without it, our vision and mission would crumble at the first sign of difficulty. Yet firmness, when it turns into rigidity, can beco…",

Think of it as a pipeline of data where you can apply a series of transformations and computations in a fluent, functional style.\n⚠️ Streams don’t store data.

It failed because the native React runtime does not include the Node standard library.\n\n\nTurns out the issue is caused by ws, a dependency of supabase-js, trying to use a Node-specific module — which obviously doesn’t play nice with the Expo runtime.\n✅ Fix\nhttps://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/issues/1400\nYou need to add a custom metro.config.js file to shim Node core modules:\n// metro.config.js\nconst { getDefaultConfig } = require(\"expo/metro-config\");\n\nconst config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);\n\n// Add this for Node core module fallbacks\nconfig.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [\"node_modules\"];\nconfig.resolver.extraNodeModules = {\n  stream: require.resolve(\"readable-stream\"),\n};\n\nmodule.exports = config;\n\nHope this saves someone else the headache!
