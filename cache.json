          "description": "Q: How many tags should we slap on our AWS resources?\nA: Look, I've been doing this for years across probably 20+ different companies, and here's what actually works in the real world. Most places that don't hate their lives use around 5-8 mandatory tags - stuff like CostCenter, Environment, Owner, Project, Application. That's your baseline. Then maybe 3-5 more depending on what kind of weird edge cases your business throws at you.\nBut seriously, don't be that guy who tries to tag literally everything. I worked at one place where they had a 23-tag minimum. Nobody followed it. Half the tags were garbage. The whole thing was a mess. Stick to tags that solve actual problems you're having right now.\nQ: What's the difference between cost allocation tags and regular tags anyway?\nA: Okay, this co…",

For example, the sale.order model corresponds to the sale_order table. However, this pattern isn't always consistent. For instance, you might expect the ir.action.server model to map to the ir_action_server table, but the actual table name is ir_act_server.\nThis subtle naming quirk can be easy to overlook and may cause confusion when working with Odoo's database.

It worked well for simple projects, and I didn’t think much about architecture back then.\nBut as my apps became more complex, problems started creeping in. Business logic got tangled up in views, error handling became chaotic, and the separation of concerns practically disappeared. The system functioned, sure — but it felt lifeless. Everything was wired together in a fragile way, and maintaining it became a chore.\nAs I explored frameworks like Spring Boot and Golang for building web apps, I began to question like \nWhy not MVCS — Model, View, Controller, and Service — in Django as well?  \n\n\nWhy does the traditio…",

          "description": "One of the hardest refactorings to get right is the balance between extract and inlining of functions.\nOften people struggle to understand why sometimes when they \"do the right thing\" and extract a function, their code quality feels like it decreases - this is actually one of my biggest criticisms of Clean Code as a book - it's rife with low quality method extraction.\nI think that feeling comes from the weight of \"context transference\".\nContext transference is the amount of information you have to pass between boundaries, and method extraction where 100% of the callers context needs to be transferred for the new function to be meaningful is a poor refactor. You don't reduce any cognitive load - it's a failure of encapsulation.\nIn object oriented languages this is a more common problem because the context is often scoped to a class, so it's implicit which parts of state are used in any given function, and as a result this transfer of context is equally implicit. \nWhile it might sound like object scoped state is actually a solution to this problem, it isn't, because the transfer of context is actually the amount of information the programmer has to mentally track during code reading, not the information a computer has to track (because functions exist purely for the programmer) - it's a design time concern and rarely a significant runtime one.\nExtraction refactorings should operate on a strict subset of the context of the parent function to be meaningful and not detrimental to reading code, as a general rule.\n(Standard disclosure: generalisations include exceptions by default, I'm sure there are many cases where this doesn't apply)",
