          "description": "üåê Understanding the Basics of REST APIs\n\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever used a weather app or fetched data from a website, chances are you‚Äôve interacted with a REST API. But what exactly is a REST API? And why is it so essential in today‚Äôs web development world?\nLet‚Äôs break it down step by step.\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is like a waiter at a restaurant. You (the client) tell the waiter what you want (make a request), the waiter takes it to the kitchen (server), and then brings back your food (the response).\nIn tech terms, an API allows two software systems to communicate with each other.\nREST (Representational State Transfer) is a set of rules and conventions for building web APIs. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources.\nThe 4 most common HTTP methods are:\nGET - Retrieve data\nPOST - Create new data\nPUT - Update existing data\nDELETE - Remove data\n\nPostman ‚Äî For sending API requests\nJSONPlaceholder ‚Äî Free fake REST API for testing\nREST APIs are everywhere. Understanding how they work is a key skill for modern developers. Once you grasp the basics, you can build full-stack apps that talk to servers, fetch live data, and power real-world features.",
