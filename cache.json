Artificial intelligence isn‚Äôt a future shock anymore; it‚Äôs the quiet infrastructure of modern life. But this pervasive intelligence comes with a gnawing unease. As AI‚Äôs power grows exponentially, so does a fundamental question: can we really trust a system whose reasoning remains, for all intents and purposes, a black box?\nThe problem isn‚Äôt Skynet. It‚Äôs something far more subtle, and arguably more dangerous: a creeping opacity. We‚Äôre handing over increasingly critical decisions to algorithms we don‚Äôt understand, and the implications are starting to ripple through everything from healthcare to high finance.
