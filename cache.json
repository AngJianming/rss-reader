It's a world designed for ease. A world where, before the sunlight even warms your windowpane, an algorithm already knows how you slept, recommends your breakfast, and lines up your day like dominoes.\nAnd yet, as I sip my morning coffee, I find myself wondering:\nThis is the fracture—the subtle crack between the life we live and the life we are nudged into living. A fracture not just between human and machine, but between convenience and consciousness, control and surrender, existence and intention.\nWe created AI to help us understand the world.

It needs a good landing.\nFather's Day means you have to laugh at your Dad's joke. For this challenge, I built a landing page for dad jokes. It has plenty of Dad jokes, a button to get a random joke, and links to more dad jokes related content.\nThis is the codepen for the site.\n\n\n\n\nThe live page. \nlive page\nI was trying to figure something do for a June Celebration. Fathers Day's was just a few days away. Humor and jokes are a big part of my family so I focused on laughing with my dad and son.\nThis is a static HTML site with a button that calls a Joke API. I modified my code from a Danny Thompson tutorial from a while ago. I could have changed APIs but this one had a filter option to block inappropriate jokes. I set the call to send puns and block NSFW stuff.\nThe color pallet is based off of Dad's Root Beer branding. I thought about making a CSS version of the can for the art challenge but wanted something up the Friday before Father's Day. I may do it before DEV's Challenge Deadline of June 29.\nThe cover image was made with Photoshop. The logo is what was envisioned for the CSS Art. It might be added to the live page.\n\nI visited a bunch of joke sites to find some that were decent to share. I'd like to add a section to submit your own jokes. This is not finished, It will be updates as time allows. Just wanted it up before Father's Day.\nThis was a fun early internet kind of build. I really enjoyed researching and building it.",
