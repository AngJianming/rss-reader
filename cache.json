As mentioned earlier, the cluster will consist of three physical machines. Since Kubernetes uses a control-plane/worker model and we only have three nodes, each one will serve as both a control-plane and a worker. This setup allows workloads to be scheduled on all nodes while maintaining control-plane functionality.\nTalos is a modern, minimalistic operating system designed specifically to run Kubernetes-and nothing else. It is immutable, meaning the OS is read-only and cannot be modified. This immutability improves security, making it more difficult for attackers to alter the system.\nTalos is also built to be managed entirely via Kubernetes, simpli…",

The advantage of this is that the field type can be more consistent with the actual data and make subsequent SQL queries more convenient.\nSelect Rebuild Mode - Select Auto Detect, and click Start to re-import\n\nSee again\n\nWe can save the import configuration so that we can repeat the import next time.\n\nYou can see the saved import in the object interface or under the database connection on the left\n\nNext time you open the software, first double-click the connection name to open the connection - double-click the import name to open the saved import.\n\nJust click to start\n\nDiLu Converter is a powerful automated Excel import and export tool that supports more than 10 databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Access, and Hive. The supported file formats include xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, csv, txt, xml, json, and dbf. Its native user interface brings users a comfortable experience of simplified Excel import and export, making Excel import and export easier than ever before.

The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.\nThink of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy.
