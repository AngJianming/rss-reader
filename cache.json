          "description": "With the growing adoption of AI agents and LLM-powered applications, securing the communication layer between these systems has become critical.\nAt Zuplo, we've introduced two new Zuplo policies designed specifically to protect endpoints used by AI agents, LLMs and MCP servers: Prompt Injection Detection and Secret Masking.\nThese policies work seamlessly with our recently launched remote MCP server support, but they're equally valuable for any API endpoint that interfaces with LLMs or AI agents.\nWant to see these policies in action with a remote MCP server and OpenAI? See the video below!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Why These Policies Matter\n\n\nAI agents often process user-generated content and make API calls based on that input.
