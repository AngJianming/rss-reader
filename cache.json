          "description": "At the end of 2024, I embarked on the Cloud Resume Challenge, a hands-on project that transformed my understanding of cloud computing and security. I have a background in video production and strategic communication but, was eager to pivot into cloud security. It's been a dream of mine for a long time to learn about and eventually work in IT. The challenge, created by Forrest Brazeal, pushed me to build a serverless resume website on AWS, automate its deployment, and implement advanced security measures. The result? A fully functional, secure website at trisoncloudresume.com and a portfolio that showcases my skills in AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD. Here’s a breakdown of my journey, the skills I gained, and the security mods that make this project stand out.\nThe Challenge: Building a Serverless…",

          "description": "Back in the 1960s, when computers were still a relatively new frontier, the term \"software engineering\" was first coined. The folks developing these early digital systems looked to a well-established field for guidance: civil engineering. They imagined building software much like constructing a bridge or a skyscraper, applying rigorous principles of design, analysis, and construction. This initial comparison profoundly shaped how we first approached creating software.\n\nIt made sense, then, that the waterfall model became the go-to approach. Think of it like a meticulous building project: you gather all the requirements, then design, then build, then test, and finally, deploy. Each phase had to be perfectly completed before moving on to the next. This rigid, step-by-step process mirrored th…",
