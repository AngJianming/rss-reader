I’ve been experimenting with a few online B2B portals to list my products, and Global Trade Plaza was one I signed up for a few months ago.\nThe interface is pretty straightforward, and to my surprise, I got some inquiries that weren’t just spam. One buyer from Southeast Asia followed through and placed a moderate order last month. Not huge, but for a first deal via a lesser-known portal, I’d say it’s encouraging.\nI’ve seen mixed opinions online, so I’m wondering—has anyone else here actually closed deals via GTP? Was your experience similar? Not saying it’s perfect, but it seems like it might be a legit option for small exporters looking for new markets.",

Two of the core concepts every developer must understand are data types and functions. Let’s dive into each of these.\n           ---\n\nJavaScript Data Types\nPrimitive Data Types\nThese are the basic building blocks:\n\n\n\nType\nExample\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nString\n\"Hello\"\nText enclosed in quotes\n\n\nNumber\n\n42, 3.14\n\nIntegers and floating-point numbers\n\n\nBoolean\n\ntrue, false\n\nLogical values\n\n\nNull\nnull\nEmpty or non-existent value\n\n\nUndefined\nundefined\nVariable declared but not assigned\n\n\nSymbol\nSymbol(\"id\")\nUnique and immutable value\n\n\nBigInt\n1234567890123456789n\nLarge integers beyond Number limits\n\n\n\n ---\n\nNon-Primitive (Reference) Data Types\nThese can hold multiple values or complex structures:\n•Object: { name: \"John\", age: 30 }\n•Array: [1, 2, 3]\n•Function: function() { ... }\nlet name = \"Alice\";       // String\n🔧 JavaScript Functions\nDeclaring a Function\nfunction greet(name) {\nconsole.log(greet(\"Alice\")); // Output: Hello, Alice!\nFunction Expressions\nconst add = function (a, b) {\nconsole.log(add(2, 3)); // Output: 5\nArrow Functions (ES6+)\nconst multiply = (x, y) => x * y;\nconsole.log(multiply(4, 5)); // Output: 20\nWhy Use Functions?\nBetter organization\nEasier to test and debug\n📝 Conclusion\nUnderstanding data types and functions is fundamental in JavaScript.

Today we’ll connect our HTML page with JavaScript to make it interactive. We’ll cover:\n➤ The DOM (Document Object Model)\nalert() popups\nonclick events\nconsole\n📜 1.What is the DOM?\nThe DOM is how JavaScript sees and interacts with your HTML page.\nselect, change, and control elements on the page.\n👇 Example: Select an element by ID\nlet title = document.getElementById(\"main-title\");\nconsole.log(title);\n\n📶 This grabs:\n<h1 id=\"main-title\">Welcome!</h1>\n\n🌍 2.Global vs Local Variables:\n↗ Global → accessible anywhere\n↗ Local → accessible only inside a function\n👇 Example:\nlet globalVar = \"I'm global\";\n\nfunction testScope() {\n    let localVar = \"I'm local\";\n    console.log(globalVar); // ✅ Works\n    console.log(localVar);  // ✅ Works\n}\n\nconsole.log(globalVar); // ✅ Works\nconsole.log(localVar);  // ❌ Error: localVar is not defined\n\n🚩 Tip: Avoid too many global variables to keep code clean.\n🔔 3.Showing Alerts:\nWant to pop up a message box?\nalert(\"Hello, this is an alert!\");\n\n🚩 This shows a simple browser popup.\n🖱 4.Button OnClick Event:\nWe can make buttons interactive using onclick.\n👇 Example HTML:\n<button onclick=\"showMessage()\">Click Me!</button>\n\n👇 Example js\nfunction showMessage() {\n    alert(\"Button was clicked!\");\n}\n\n🚩 Tip: You can also use addEventListener for more control.\n🕵️‍♂️ 5.From HTML to Console:\nTo send messages to the console(for debugging or tracking), use:\nconsole.log(\"This message appears in the console.\");\n\n🚩 Open the DevTools Console in your browser (usually right-click → Inspect → Console) to see it.\n🔄 Quick Recap:\n📌 Learned how the DOM connects JS to HTML\nglobal vs local variables\nalert() popups\nonclick interactivity\nconsole\nThat wraps up Session 2!\nThanks for following along — keep coding, and see you next time! 🚀✨",

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering\nCathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. \nCircle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.\nThe company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”\nRelated: Circle co-founder to create ‘AI-native’ bank after $18M raise\nUSDC market share\nWith a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).\nStablecoins by market cap.
