          "description": "In the next few weeks, I’ll explore with you how to choose a developer path: from technical deep dives to people leadership, and everything in between. Whether you’re at a fork in the road or just getting curious, this series is for you. Week 1 will be about exploring (experimentation, choosing a growth theme), Week 2 we'll focus on becoming visible and taking initiative, while the final week is about claiming growth (or moving away) and choosing your own path. Join me on this journey!\n“I want to grow, but I don’t know what my next step is.”\nSound familiar?\nSo many developers stay stuck in neutral, waiting:\nFor their manager to notice\nFor a formal opportunity\nFor the “right” timing\nFor confidence to magically appear\nBut:\nYou don’t need permission to grow.

Many developers write code that works fine during development but leads to subtle bugs and frustrating user experiences in production.\nThese issues often show up when real users interact with the app, leading to bounce rates, lost user trust, or even lost revenue.\nIn this post, I’ll break down 10 common mistakes I see (and have made myself), plus practical ways to fix them.

Recently, I had to create a runtime-initialized variable: existing approaches don't work in this case. I want to describe multiple ways to achieve it in this post.\nThe Rust language allows you to create constants. Two keywords are available: const and static.\nSometimes a certain value is used many times throughout a program, and it can become inconvenient to copy it over and over. What’s more, it’s not always possible or desirable to make it a variable that gets carried around to each function that needs it. In these cases, the const keyword provides a convenient alternative to code duplication:\nconst THING: u32 = 0xABAD1DEA;\n\nlet foo = 123 + THING;\n\n-- Keyword const\nA static item is a value which is valid for the…",

This design choice permeates every facet of the language, and perhaps nowhere is it more debated, and ultimately, more revealing, than in its approach to error handling. Go eschews the try-catch blocks of Java or Python, the monadic Result types of Rust, or the complex exception hierarchies of C++. Instead, it offers a deceptively simple, yet profound mechanism: explicit error checking. This article delves into the heart of Go's error handling, exploring its history, techniques, nuances, and why, despite its initial unfamiliarity to some, it’s a cornerstone of Go's robust and readable nature.\nerror Interface\n\n\nThe foundation of error handling in…",
