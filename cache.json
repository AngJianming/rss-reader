Over the past year, we've integrated with popular AI agents like GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit, and Greptile, giving us unprecedented visibility into how development teams are adopting and using these tools.\nThe insights we've gathered have been remarkable. Today, 85% of our paid customers actively use AI agents for code review, representing a fundamental shift in how development teams approach collaboration and quality assurance. But the real story isn't just in the adoption numbers—it's in what we've learned about how these tools are reshaping development workflows in ways we didn't anticipate.\nThis isn't simply about automation replacing manual processes. …",

Setting Safari as your default browser on Mac, iPhone, and iPad ensures a seamless browsing experience across Apple devices, leveraging its speed, privacy features, and deep integration with the Apple ecosystem.\nSafari comes as the pre-installed default browser on a new Mac. If you’ve switched to another browser by mistake or wish to revert to Safari, you can quickly and easily set it back as your default.\nLet’s look at how to make Safari the default browser on your Mac system:\nStep 1: Click the Apple icon on the top left and then System Settings (or System Preferences for older macOS versions).  \n\nStep 2: Click Desktop & Dock > Default web browser.\n\nStep 3: Click Safari from the dropdown menu.\n\nClose the window. And now you are all set to use Safari as your default browser on your Mac system.\nIf you prefer shortcuts, you can use the Spotlight Search feature.\nHere are the steps to use it:\nStep 1: Press Command + Space key to open Spotlight Search box.\n\nStep 2: Type “default web browser” and press Enter.\n\nThis navigates you directly to the System Settings, where you can choose Safari from the dropdown as explained before.\nTo make Safari your default browser on iPad/ iPhone, follow the same steps as shown below:\nNote: For this tutorial, we are using the iPhone to illustrate the steps.\nStep 1: Tap Settings on your iPhone/iPad device.\n\nStep 2: Scroll down and tap on Safari.\n\nStep 3: Tap on Default Browser App.\n\nStep 4: Tap Safari to set it as your default browser.\n\nMaking Safari your default browser on Mac, iPhone, or iPad is a quick way to get a smoother and more secure browsing experience. It has privacy tools built right in, works great with your other Apple services, and it’s easy to set up. If you want to get the best browsing on your devices, Safari is a good choice.",
