          "description": "In Azure there's no Systems Manager, that's pretty obvious when you know that it's an AWS product. However, as both clouds are very large providers, Azure should offer something similar, right? As our focus is Session Manager, there's no direct equivalent that works in the same way. However, Microsoft offers us Azure Bastion - a managed service that creates a web interface for a jumpbox that supports both SSH and RDP. This is not the same as Session Manager as you still need keys or passwords but as Azure beginner, I will try to replicate this pattern as closely as possible. The setup I want to convert from AWS to Azure is shown below.\n\nOur goal is to create a secure environment, where the instance is in a private network (subnet) and is only accessible by managed services within Azure.
