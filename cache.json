It's essential for shipping features faster, testing more effectively, and maintaining your codebase over time.\nYou'll lose at least a month and a half to refactor a decent-sized codebase, but it's worth doing while things are still manageable... before you end up rewriting everything from scratch.\nMost startups rewrite everything because it feels easier than refactoring. But if you can afford a couple of months, it's a great opportunity to clear out some technical debt... because unfortunately, debt always needs to be repaid at some point.\nWhat’s your take on refactoring?

          "description": "Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its root or base form by removing suffix or prefixes, often using simple rules, without considering the word's context or actual meaning.\nFor instance, in search engines or library catalogs, users may submit a query with one word (for example, investing) but expect results that use any inflected word form (for example, invest, investment, investments, etc.). By reducing derivational word forms to one stem word, stemming helps information retrieval systems equate morphologically related words.\nInflected words: Words whose forms change based on grammatical context, indicating aspects like tense, number, case or gender. Example run, running,runner. All used in different form of grammar.\nMorphology: Morphology is the branch of linguistics that studies the structure of words—how they are formed using smaller units called morphemes.\nRoot morpheme: carries core meaning. Example: run, talk.\nNow use nltk for stemming:\nwrite in terminal python and install WordNetLemmatizer and PorterStemmer.\n\ncode editor:\nPorterStemmer only remove suffix not prefix.",

          "description": "Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\nThe May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.\nInstead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. \n“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.\nThe letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.\nFavorable regulatory environment\nThe SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.\nAtkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.\nRelated: Crypto vulnerable if CFTC not given authority, says ex-chair Behnam\nThe following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.\nIn a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.\nMagazine: Move to Portugal to become a crypto digital nomad — Everybody else is",

They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. \nBefore examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. \nA table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 20…",

For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.\nEveryone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system.
