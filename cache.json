You need both the spin and natural abundance of every isotope for an element, but these critical numbers are scattered across PDFs, paper tables, or, even worse, different websites. It takes minutes to look them up! My programmer heart couldn‚Äôt bear such inefficiency.\nThis profoundly inhuman struggle haunted me daily during my master‚Äôs thesis in Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of Bologna.
