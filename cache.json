          "description": "As modern web applications become more complex, performance bottlenecks in the main thread can severely impact user experience. One powerful, underutilized tool to mitigate this is the Web Worker API.\nWeb Workers allow you to offload expensive JavaScript operations to a background thread, keeping the UI thread free for user interactions. Let's break it down:\nWeb Workers are JavaScript scripts that run in the background, independent of other scripts, without blocking the main thread.\nThis makes them ideal for:\nHeavy computations (e.g., parsing large JSON files)\nData processing (e.g., image manipulation)\nReal-time tasks (e.g., WebSocket handling, polling)\nWorking with IndexedDB or other async APIs\nUse Web Workers when:\nYour app has noticeable UI jank due to CPU-heavy operations.\nYou need to ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "S3 native feature of presigned URL is great - you can save on compute costs as everything will be handled by AWS for you. However, there's not much you can set when generating the URL, basically just Content-Type and Content-Disposition. But to set tags on the object, you need another call to the service. What if we wanted to store for example a description of a photo in the tag? We have 256 bytes for that so there's some space and compared to a standard implementations with the database, tags are free üòÅ.\nI've created such post already on my blog in 2023.

Our development servers were hosted on Azure, while our production and staging environments ran on AWS. Every three months, the SSL certificates for our Azure servers would expire, and we had to manually generate new certificates, update them in Azure, and modify the CNAME records in AWS Route 53.\nThis repetitive task led me to explore the Domain Name System (DNS) more deeply. What exactly was happening behind the scenes when we updated the CNAME? Why did some changes propagate instantly while others took longer?
