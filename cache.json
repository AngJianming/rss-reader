One of its useful features is Template Literals, which helps make string handling easier and more readable. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore what template literals are and also explain what WSC stands for in the context of web development.\nTemplate literals are a way to work with strings in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), they offer more flexibility compared to traditional string handling using single (') or double (\") quotes.\nTemplate literals use backticks () instead of quotes.\nlet name = \"John\";\nlet greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;\nconsole.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, John!\n\nString Interpolation\n\n\nYou can embed variables ‚Ä¶",
