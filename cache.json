In this post, we’ll highlight where PostgreSQL shines and MySQL falls short.\nOne of PostgreSQL's most underrated features is its support for transactional DDL (Data Definition Language). In PostgreSQL, you can wrap schema changes in transactions and roll them back if something goes wrong. Even better, PostgreSQL supports savepoints within DDL transactions for fine-grained control.\n-- PostgreSQL: This works!\nBEGIN;\nALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;\nSAVEPOINT after_column_add;\nCREATE INDEX idx_users_email_verified ON users(email_verified);\n-- Oops, index creation failed, but we can keep the column\nROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT after_column_add;\nCOMMIT;\n\nIn MySQL, DDL statem…",
