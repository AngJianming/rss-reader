          "description": "A UK-based biotech company, Basecamp Research, is using artificial intelligence and environmental DNA to uncover a vast new world of biology. By sampling DNA from some of the planet‚Äôs most remote and untouched ecosystems, the company has identified over one million previously unknown species. These discoveries are not just academic. They are fueling a next-generation AI platform designed to radically accelerate drug discovery.\nThe company‚Äôs genomic database is already among the largest of its kind. It is being used to train AI models that predict protein structures, functions, and interactions at unprecedented accuracy. This includes boosting tools like AlphaFold, which helps researchers visualize the shape of proteins based on genetic code alone.\nA major focus of the project is the identification of new large serine recombinases, a type of enzyme that can precisely insert large DNA sequences into the genome. These enzymes are considered highly promising for future gene therapies, including for cancer and rare genetic disorders.\nBasecamp Research is also trying to set a new standard in ethical science. The team works directly with local researchers and governments in the regions where DNA samples are collected. In return, partner countries receive royalties and scientific credit, avoiding the extractive models of earlier biotech ventures.\nThis combination of field biology, advanced sequencing, and deep learning could reshape how we find drugs, understand evolution, and build genetic tools. It is a powerful example of how AI, when paired with real-world data, can help uncover the deepest layers of life on Earth.\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9765ab86-0156-4901-b6ec-fbee465ab819",
