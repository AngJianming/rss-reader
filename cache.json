Tailgating, a subtle yet dangerous form of intrusion, happens when an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind someone who is authorized. It's a tactic that relies less on technology and more on exploiting human behavior.\nAttackers often masquerade as employees, contractors, or delivery workers. They may carry packages, wear uniforms, or claim to have forgotten their access badge—all to lower suspicion. Once inside, these individuals can do far more than just roam the premises. They might access critical systems, plant malicious software, or steal sensitive equipment.\nPretending to be a colleague and asking someone to hol…",

          "description": "When developing a web app with Laravel 12, Inertia.js, React.js, and TypeScript, I ran into a subtle but frustrating TypeScript error when using useForm from Inertia.\nI defined my form shape using an interface, like this:\ninterface DepartmentForm {\n  name: string;\n  abbr: string;\n  degree: 's1' | 's2';\n  vision: string | null;\n  mission: string | null;\n  description: string | null;\n  order: number | null;\n  photo_url?: string;\n}\n\nThen passed it into useForm:\nconst { data, setData, post, processing, errors, reset } = useForm<DepartmentForm>({\n  name: '',\n  abbr: '',\n  degree: 's1',\n  vision: '',\n  mission: '',\n  description: '',\n  order: 0,\n  photo_url: '',\n});\n\nBut TypeScript complained about the index signature not being compatible — something like:\nType 'DepartmentForm' does not satisfy the constraint '{ [key: string]: any; }'\n\ntype Instead\n\n\nChanging the interface to a type fixed it immediately:\ntype DepartmentForm = {\n  name: string;\n  abbr: string;\n  degree: 's1' | 's2';\n  vision: string | null;\n  mission: string | null;\n  description: string | null;\n  order: number | null;\n  photo_url?: string;\n};\n\nNo more type errors!\ninterface in TypeScript doesn’t allow excess properties unless an index signature is explicitly declared. On the other hand, type is more flexible when passed to generic utilities like Inertia's useForm that expect dynamic key access ([key: string]: any).\nI hope this helps someone out there who's scratching their head like I was.

It's not just you - it's part of the journey.\nBut some principles make your code more navigable:\nGroup by feature, not file type\nKeep related code close together\nBe consistent with your naming conventions\nFor Node.js projects, I recommend:\nproject/\n├── src/\n│   ├── routes/\n│   ├── controllers/\n│   ├── models/\n│   └── utils/\n├── tests/\n├── config/\n└── package.json\n\nAs your project evolves, let your folder structure evolve too. Don't overengineer from day one.\nAdd a README explaining your organization choices to help future you (and teammates).\nThe folder structure that terrified me two years ago is now something I build with confidence. That's why I'm building a community for developers who want to level up their project organization skills.\nIf you've ever collapsed a folder tree out of fear, you're not alone.

Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.\nIt’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…",

PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. \nThe plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. \n“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said. \nThis can be done without…",

That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”\nThe SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities.
