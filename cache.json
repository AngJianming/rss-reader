          "description": "What I Understand from SQL vs NoSQL\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  SQL(Structured Query Language)\n\n\nSQL is a database that stores data in a vertical way. In SQL databases, you store data in the form of row and columns. The first row contains fields, and the next row contain data for those fields. So it's like adding data vertically.\nSQL is mostly used in applications where you already know the structure of the data before storing it. For example, if you want to store user data or banking data, you can use a SQL database.\nNoSQL is a database that stores data in horizontal way. In this, data is stored in JSON format, and you can have as many fields as you want. It is generally faster compared to SQL.\nWhen you have dynamic data with multiple fields, you use a NoSQL database. For example, when storing product dat‚Ä¶",
