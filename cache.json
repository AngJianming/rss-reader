          "description": "We all want to write clean, maintainable code — but sometimes it feels like a constant battle. You’ve probably heard all the usual advice: use meaningful variable names, follow style guides, refactor regularly. But there’s a hidden trick to writing cleaner code that no one talks about.\nThis trick isn’t just about syntax or formatting. It’s about structuring your code to express intent clearly. When your code shows why something exists, not just how it works, it becomes much easier for you and others to understand and maintain it. This can mean using mental models or patterns that map your code to real-world concepts and behaviors.\nWhy is this overlooked? Most tutorials focus on quick fixes like style or small refactors, but they miss the deeper design mindset. Embedding intention into code design takes more thought upfront — something many avoid because of tight deadlines or old habits.\nSo how do you apply this in practice? Start by giving every function or module a clear, focused purpose. Group related logic into small components that reflect real concepts from your domain. Use mental models like commands, queries, or events to organize behavior. Before finishing, ask yourself: “If I came back in six months, would I immediately understand why this exists?”\nYou’ll notice several benefits right away: your code becomes easier to maintain, onboarding teammates gets faster, code reviews are smoother, and you build less technical debt over time.\nThe next time you write code, try to go beyond style and syntax. Think about the intent behind your work. And if you have your own hidden tricks for writing clean code, I’d love to hear them!",

What do you think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Everything You Ever Wondered About SQL Performance: Deep Dive\n\n\nThis is not your typical SQL tuning talk. We’re deep diving --> beyond basic indexing tips --> into how modern relational databases actually parse, plan, and execute your queries.\nDo you know how SQL is parsed?\nWhy does the optimizer sometimes pick the “wrong” plan?\nAlong the way we'll stumble upon subtle ways things can go wrong!\nHow can correlated subqueries sabotage execution?\nWhen do query rewrites go sideways?\nFrom PostgreSQL's bitmap scans to SQL Server's parallelism quirks to MySQL's index merge madness - learn to spot performance killers and know exactly which optimization lever to pull.\nIf you've ever stared at a slow query wondering \"what exactly is the database doing right now?\" - find the answer in this talk. Packed with example code, edge cases, and real-world pathologies, it’s everything you’ve ever wanted to know about SQL performance (and probably a few things you didn’t - but should!).\nYou'll walk away knowing exactly what to do when a query runs slow. Instead of randomly adding indexes and hoping for the best, you'll systematically diagnose performance problems by reading execution plans like a roadmap to the bottleneck. You'll recognize optimizer mistakes, know when a table scan is actually faster than an index, and understand why that \"helpful\" CTE is secretly destroying your performance.\nMost importantly, you'll think like the database itself. Predict which queries will be fast, which will be disasters, and how to rewrite the disasters into successes. No more mystery, no more guesswork, just the confidence that comes from understanding what's actually happening under the hood.",

One critical aspect is resource management and preventing unbounded execution.\nWhy It Matters\nIn Move, unbounded execution happens when a function loops over a data structure (like a list) that can grow infinitely, consuming excessive gas and potentially causing transactions to fail. Similarly, storing all user data in a single global structure can make your contract vulnerable to attacks and inefficient. \nReal-World Example\nImagine running an online marketplace on Aptos, like eBay, where users place buy orders for items. All orders are stored in one global list accessible to everyone. An attacker could flood the list with thousands of fake orders, making it slow or impossible to search f…",
