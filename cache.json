          "description": "Flaky tests—those that pass and fail intermittently without code changes—are the bane of any CI/CD pipeline. They erode developer confidence and block deployments. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to detect flaky tests using machine learning and how this AI-driven approach can improve your software delivery.\nWhy Use AI in Testing?\nWith Agile and DevOps pushing rapid deployments, we need smarter testing solutions. AI brings automation and intelligence to QA by:\nPredicting failure-prone areas\nOptimizing test execution\nAuto-generating test cases\nDetecting flaky tests\nLet’s focus on the last one—flaky test detection using ML.\nThe Framework: Flaky Test Detection with ML\n** Step 1: Collect CI Data**\nUse logs from Jenkins/GitHub Actions:\nTest execution results\nCommit metadata\nStack traces\nStore this data in CSV or a small database.\n** Step 2: Feature Engineering**\nExtract meaningful features like:\nFrequency of failure\nExecution time variance\nCode churn (lines added/deleted)\nStack trace similarity\nStep 3: Train the Model\nUse ML classifiers like:\nRandom Forest\nSVM\nXGBoost\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nmodel = XGBClassifier()\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n** Step 4: Integrate into CI/CD**\nBuild a REST API or Jenkins plugin to call your model.\nFlag flaky tests during pull requests.\nAlert devs via Slack or cancel the build if flakiness is too high.\nBenefits\nReduce debugging time\nBoost confidence in automation\nImprove release stability\nSave CI/CD cost\nFuture Work\nUse GPT-style LLMs to generate test cases\nApply Reinforcement Learning for self-healing automation\nBuild Explainable AI to justify ML decisions to dev teams\nConclusion\nAI in testing is no longer a buzzword—it's a necessity. By using ML models for flaky test detection, you bring stability, speed, and intelligence to your QA pipelines.",

          "description": "by someone who only wanted to do summation.\n\n\nMy interaction with Excel this week has shown me that working with it is similar to knowing that one person who doesn't say much but has layers to them that you begin to notice after one interaction.\nOn the surface, Excel is a spreadsheet that you organise and format data for storage; however, you find it appealing. It is quite humbling to think you are tech-savvy, then spending the next two hours trying to convert the percentages to integers. \nThis cordial spreadsheet holds the power to analyse, automate, model, present data, and, for the unfortunate, cause despair. One missing comma and you can't format the whole column in a dataset. Excel is excellent at data analysis, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets, which is particularly useful for departments such as sales, marketing, and finance to make informed forecasts.\nOne feature that stuck out to me was pivot tables. They are easy to navigate and are useful for grouping, filtering, and comparing different information across multiple capacities. Conditional formatting is another handy tool that highlights cells based on specific rules to gain targeted information, such as identifying underperforming sectors in a given field. The most exciting part is that with Excel, different tools can be used in combinations and permutations according to how much you know Excel.\nThe more I learn about Excel, the more I see data differently since structures and hidden relationships that went unnoticed are being revealed. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, you begin to ask better questions, and that is a fine indicator that you are engaging with data analytically for interpretation. Then, Excel becomes a lens to spot the missing links, or what escapes the untrained eye.",

          "description": "I've been working on a \"passion project\" for a bit now while I'm between paid work. It's not open-source just yet but soon as I polish the codebase.\nI was inspired by https://carbon.now.sh/ for sharing code snippets on social media but I wanted a tight integration with Github's Gists, a focus on embedding the code in posts like Markdown with access to the code.\nI thought I'd test out NuxtHub powered by Nuxt (Vue.js) and a tight integration with Cloudflare Pages/Workers and other solutions.\nSo I've run iteration after iteration (iteratively) as I hit walls. So firstly to highlight code you generally want a library like highlighter.js or what I went with Shiki\nThe first wall, you cannot upload every language and every theme on a free plan to cloudflare. So importing them will fail the deploy. \nThe languages are much more important, for some reason there is a hard fail in Shiki if a language is not found instead of falling back to plaintext.\nI eventually hacked this and loaded the CDN version with vue's useHead feature. to on demand require the correct languages.\nThe next hurdle was I wanted \"OG\" images or images to share and embed with posts. I tried NuxtHub/CloudFlare's browser api for on demand rendering but on the free plan it's not feasible.\nSo I went to trusty html2canvas It works really well with some caveats; which I hit. It does not render SVG backgrounds well, or complicated CSS3 gradients. to hack this I basically append a png background if screenshot is occurring, this happens only if the og:image hasn't been created/uploaded before.\nI hit some more walls that I will go into next post, I also solved the html2canvas issue.\nFeel free to checkout an example here https://gist-share.nuxt.dev/gist/9bd761223a76e148af576546cd1e3e93",

          "description": "Today was huge — and nerve-wracking.\nAfter days of polishing every detail, we officially submitted Story Hero to the iOS App Store for review. This is a massive step forward, but it comes with serious risk: Apple's review process is notoriously slow and strict — and we're building an app for kids, which adds another layer of complexity.\nWe’ve seen horror stories of reviews taking 2–3 weeks… and with less than 2 weeks left in the hackathon, any major delay could mean launching too late. So we spent the day triple-checking every detail:\n✅ COPPA compliance documentation\n✅ Privacy Policy and Terms of Service\n✅ Contact and Support info\n✅ Landing page polish\n✅ App Store metadata\n✅ Minimal but functional MVP\nIf this first version gets through, we can start pushing updates using Expo EAS without needing to resubmit every time. That’s the plan.\n\nWe also made major strides in story generation costs! We’re down from $3.00 to ~80 cents per story — nearly a 4x improvement. We achieved this through:\nCode refactors\nSmarter API usage\nLeveraging more efficient model calls\nEvery cent matters when scaling a business. This optimization brings us closer to a viable pricing model post-hackathon.\nAfter exploring several options for consistent, personalized image generation (including custom pipelines, DreamBooth, etc.), the winner is still: OpenAI Image Gen v1.\nIt’s fast, consistent, takes direction better than anything else, and crucially — doesn’t require hours of training per user.\nFor our needs (1 photo → immediate image gen with likeness), nothing else competes right now.\nThe push continues. App store submission is out of our hands for now… so tomorrow, we keep building and improving what we can control.\nLet’s get this thing across the finish line.\n– Josh & Daniel\nStory Hero\n\nWhat is Story Hero?\n\nTwitter/X\n\nDEV Blog",
