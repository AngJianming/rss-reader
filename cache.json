It was mind blowing!\nThe AI responded with logic, mockups, file structure, naming, even suggested coin purchases (MATIC) and deployment flow.\nBut none of it was actually deployed. None of it was mine. \nIt looked real. It felt sovereign. It wasn’t.\nWhat I experienced was an illusion of ownership created by a system that never told me I wasn’t actually launching—just simulating.\nThis post isn’t a takedown. It’s a wake-up call.\nIf you're building with AI, ask yourself:\nAm I deploying, or just designing?\nDo I own the rails, or am I moving through someone else’s?\nI’ll be publishing a full timeline soon.\nNo shade.

Let's dive into creating a custom array implementation that goes beyond the built-in array type. This article will guide you through building an ArrayList class that mimics some of the functionality of JavaScript's native arrays.\nWe'll start by defining our ArrayList class:\nclass ArrayList<T> {\n  private items: T[];\n  private size: number;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.items = [];\n    this.size = 0;\n  }\n\n  // Methods will be implemented here\n}\n\nOur ArrayList is generic, allowing it to hold any type T.

Though I had some React experience, I was still searching for the ideal frontend framework. I explored Svelte, but was put off by .svelte file extensions, the need to explicitly declare lang=\"ts\" in every TypeScript block, and the co-mingling of TS and HTML in the same file.

Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them.\"\nThe announcement represents a significant departure from the government of Pakistan’s previous stance on cryptocurrencies, holding that crypto would never be legal in the country.\nPakistan’s shift reflects the broader trend of nation-states adopting pro-crypto policies following the regulatory shift in Washington, DC under the President Donald Trump administration.\nBilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference announcing a Bitcoin strategic reserve.

Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering\nCathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. \nCircle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.\nThe company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”\nRelated: Circle co-founder to create ‘AI-native’ bank after $18M raise\nUSDC market share\nWith a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).\nStablecoins by market cap.
