          "description": "As a junior computer science student, I was working on a campus second-hand trading platform project last semester when I stumbled upon the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework‚Äî it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!\nWhen I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane‚Äôs Context (or ctx for short). I remember the first time I wanted to get the request method. In traditional Rust HTTP frameworks, I would have to write:\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method(‚Ä¶",
