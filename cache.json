Conventional strategies like a side hustle or investing in stocks might seem daunting to some.

          "description": "A few months ago, I started wondering: “How should we actually test database migrations?”\n(Yes, that thing no one really does.)\nWell — sometimes people do test them, to be fair. The standard approach usually involves writing integration tests and checking how the application behaves with the new schema version.\nBut honestly, that’s not nearly enough to ensure the migration itself is correct.\nA lot can go wrong:\nALTER TABLE suddenly takes an EXCLUSIVE ACCESS lock and production freezes until it’s done.\n\n\nAn index works on your local machine — but silently fails on prod.\n\n\nA migration wipes out data (someone forgot to delete a DROP TABLE used for debugging), and the last dump was from the Mesozoic era.\n\n\n…\nThere are many hypothetical issues like this — enough material for several talks.\nI decided to focus on something simple and fundamental:\nHow do we validate that a migration is correct in terms of schema state?\nMy reasoning\nA valid migration should:\napply cleanly;\n\n\nbe reversible (a downgrade should work);\n\n\nbe idempotent (you can apply/rollback it as many times as needed);\n\n\nand most importantly — after a full up + down, the schema should match the original, semantically.\n\n\n\nThat led me to build a CLI tool that tests your migrations for schema correctness.\nYou can read more about the methodology in the project’s repository.\nSo I’d really appreciate your help: bug reports, issues, PRs — all welcome.\n👉 Seqwall on GitHub: https://github.com/realkarych/seqwall",

          "description": "Tracking an asynchronous action's pending state is a very common task in the process of building UIs. Most UIs will show a loading indicator while async data fetching is in progress and an error message if the async action fails, e.g. due to a network error.\nThe question is: Can async action handling feel like setting up lightweight scaffolding without breaking into the code of the successful scenario? Similarly to JS error handling with try...catch...finally that can be easily added to the code of a successful case at any stage of the application development without major changes.\nMost ways to handle an async action's state are wired into complex libs either for data fetching (like Tanstack React Query, RTK Query) or shared state management (like Redux Toolkit). Introducing such libs and adapting the code to them (and to some arguably clumsy patterns at times [1+2, 3]) require sizable rewrites and don't quite feel like adding lightweight scaffolding to the existing code.\nIn order to address my question, I ended up creating a small package called transient-state. It helps track async actions' state without breaking into the async actions' code and the app's shared state (or even requiring one). The async action's state can be used either locally or shared between multiple components equally easily. The package description outlines these and some other options in more detail.",

If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. \nIf you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will …",
