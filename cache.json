Unlike ANNs, where neurons activate based on weighted sums of inputs, SNNs operate on discrete \"spikes\" or events. Neurons in an SNN fire only when their membrane potential, accumulated from incoming spikes, reaches a certain threshold. This event-driven nature offers significant advantages, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and suitability for processing real-time, asynchronous data streams.\nAt their core, SNNs offer a promise of more energy-efficient and biologically plausible AI.

However, browser support for these features can vary. A powerful strategy to ensure consistent behavior across environments is polyfilling, which involves creating custom implementations of features that may not yet be natively supported.\nThis article aims to provide an exhaustive exploration of the creation and implementation of custom polyfills for future ECMAScript features.
