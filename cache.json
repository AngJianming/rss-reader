          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nGit is a powerful version control system that helps developers manage code changes efficiently. One of its useful features is the ability to revert commits---undoing changes from previous commits. The git revert command is commonly used for this, but the --no-commit flag adds extra flexibility, especially when reverting multiple commits.\nIn this guide, we'll explore git revert --no-commit for beginners, intermediate, and advanced users, with practical examples at each level.\ngit revert\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What is git revert?\n\n\ngit revert creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit.

Flexbox, short for the Flexible Box Layout Module, is a powerful layout model in CSS that helps you design responsive and easy-to-manage web layouts. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll break down the basics of Flexbox and walk you through some examples.\nFlexbox is a layout model in CSS3 that arranges elements in a predictable way even when their size is dynamic or unknown. It works on a one-dimensional layout, either in a row (horizontal) or a column (vertical).\nTo use Flexbox, you set a container’s display property to flex:\n.container {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\nThis makes all direct child elements of .container flexible items that can be aligned and distributed within the container.\nUnderst…",
