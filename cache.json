Define Your Website’s Purpose and Goals\n2. Gather and Share Key Branding Elements\n3. Show Examples of What You Like—and Don’t Like\n4. Prepare Content Before the Design Phase Begins\n5. Decide on a Single Point of Contact\n6. Be Honest and Constructive with Feedback\n7. Understand What’s Included in the Project Scope\n8. Respect the Timeline—but Stay Flexible\n9. Ask About Website Ownership and Access\n10. Plan for Post-Launch Support\nQ: How do I choose the right web designer for my project?\nQ: What platform should I build my website on?\nQ: Can I request changes after the website goes live?\nQ: Do I need to hire a developer as well as a designer?\nCollaborating with a website designer isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about creating a site that works for your users and grows your business. \nBy defining clear goals, preparing content early, and maintaining open communication, you can avoid costly revisions and ensure a smooth process.\nTreat your designer as a creative partner, not just a service provider. \nWith mutual respect and shared vision, you’ll walk away with a website that’s not only visually appealing but also strategically effective.\nWant expert feedback on your website?

          "description": "So, you're thinking about hiring a DevOps engineer in 2025—but not sure where to start? Don’t worry, you’re not alone. It can sound a bit complicated at first, especially if you’re not too deep into tech stuff. But once you know what to look for, it’s not that hard.\nWhat does a DevOps engineer actually do?\nDevOps engineer is the person who helps your developers and IT team work together better. They make sure your website, app, or software runs smoothly, gets updated easily, and doesn’t go down often.\nWhat should you look for?\n1. Knows a bit of both worlds—coding and servers\nIn 2025 and coming years, most companies will use cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. So if someone’s used any of these, that’s a big plus.\n2. Comfortable with automation tools\nThis is important.\nYou can simply ask:\n3. Can explain things in a simple way\nIf they can talk clearly and avoid buzzwords, it means they’ll be easy to work with. You can test this during your chat—just ask them to explain something simple and see how they do it.\n4. Calm when things break\nYou can ask:\n5. Understands basic security\nIf they’ve worked with security teams before or handled cloud security, that’s even better.\n6. Good attitude > too many years of experience\n7. Fits in with your team\nSkills can always be taught. But being a team player? That’s a must from day one.\nWrapping it up\nKnows how to connect code and infrastructure\nUses automation to make life easier\nCommunicates well\nSolves problems without drama\nUnderstands basic security\nHas the right attitude\nFits in with your team\nHiring the right person can save you from a lot of future headaches. So take your time, ask simple questions, and trust your gut. You’ve got this!",

Here's how to write Bash scripts that perform like they should.\nBefore diving into specific techniques, understand that Bash performance optimization is about reducing system calls, minimizing subprocess creation, and leveraging built-in capabilities.\nThe golden rule: Every time you call an external command, you're creating overhead.

          "description": "This blog post explains how to configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can be dynamically controlled through environment variables.\nWhen setting up mcp-graphql, we needed a way for the MCP server to use a dynamic GraphQL endpoint and token. Hardcoding these values was not an option, as different Saleor environments require different configurations.\nHere’s what we did:\nCreated a shell script to manage the mcp-graphql startup.\nLoaded the endpoint and token from a .env file within the script.\nLaunched the MCP server using these environment variables.\nUsed this shell script as the entry point for MCP configuration in clients like Cursor or VSCode\nBelow is the shell script (start-mcp-graphql.sh) that performs steps 1–3:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nset -a\n# Load environment variables from .env file next to this script\nSCRIPT_DIR=\"$(cd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\" && pwd)\"\nsource \"$SCRIPT_DIR/.env\"\nset +a\n\nENDPOINT=\"$MCP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT\" HEADERS=\"{\\\"Authorization\\\":\\\"Bearer $MCP_GRAPHQL_TOKEN\\\"}\" npx mcp-graphql\n\nUsing the Script in MCP Clients\n\n\nTo use this setup with Cursor, add the following to your configuration:\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Saleor GraphQL API\": {\n      \"command\": \"./mcp/start-mcp-graphql.sh\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor VSCode, configure the server as follows:\n{\n  \"servers\": {\n    \"Saleor GraphQL API\": {\n      \"type\": \"stdio\",\n      \"command\": \"${workspaceFolder}/mcp/start-mcp-graphql.sh\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSummary\n\n\nWith this approach, you can easily configure your MCP server dynamically using environment variables. You’ll find all the source code, scripts, and editor configs ready to explore in the Saleor apps repository.",

For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.\nEveryone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …",
