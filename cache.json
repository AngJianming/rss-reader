When I first joined the company, I had a clear vision to modernize Meteor and transform Galaxy into something bigger.\nToday, I'm excited to tell you that these changes are finally happening.\nFirst things first! We're introducing fresh new brands for both Meteor and Galaxy. This isn't just a cosmetic facelift. It shows that we are changing our direction in an important way.\n\n\nWe've been using the original Meteor logo for more than 13 years, and it has become quite recognizable within the JavaScript community. The decision to change it wasn't made hastily, but we felt it was essential to reflect our ongoing evolution.\nOur new Meteor brand represents our commitment to mo‚Ä¶",

This operator handles all the complexity for you so I prefer this method for deploying Ray on K8s.\nRay dashboard provides visibility into overall cluster health, jobs, nodes etc.\nUsed Open WebUI for dashboard. Installed NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager Exporter for monitoring NVIDIA GPU usage in Grafana.\nCurrently, AFAIK, for getting monitoring data from NVIDIA GPUs you have to install the NVIDIA DCGM exporter.  It is straight-forward and exports needed metrics like GPU temperature, GPU Power usage, GPU utilization etc.\nRay, Open WebUI, vLLM, Mistral - All are open source software capable of scaling LLM inference very high. This is an exciting development for open source. \nIf you are new to my posts, I regularly post about AWS, MCP, Kubernetes and Cloud computing related topics. \nDo follow me in LinkedIn and visit my dev.to posts.
