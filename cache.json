I've been watching indie hackers and startup founders frantically cobbling together tech stacks with Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queues, Elasticsearch for search, and MongoDB for... reasons?\nI'm guilty of this too. When I started building UserJot (my feedback and roadmap tool), my first instinct was to plan out a \"proper\" architecture with separate services for everything. Then I stopped and asked myself: what if I just used Postgres for everything?\nTurns out, there's this elephant in the room that nobody wants to acknowledge:\nPostgres can do literally all of this.\nAnd it does it better than you think.\nLet me guess - you've been told that Postgres is \"just a relational database\" and you need specialized tools for spec‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Exploring the Benefits of Immutability in JavaScript Performance\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Introduction\n\n\nImmutability has emerged as a dominant paradigm in modern software engineering, particularly in functional programming and state management. In JavaScript, where mutation can lead to unpredictable states and difficult-to-maintain code, the advantages of immutability extend far beyond the realm of cleaner syntax. This article examines immutability's historical context, technical underpinnings, and its impact on performance, drawing upon real-world applications and advanced implementation techniques.\nImmutability has its roots in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Lisp.

Few things that I understood are :\nApart from these basic things , I finally completed my \"hello world\" ritual in Java !! Syntax to take user input got me off for a while , but I managed to understand the reason for it to be complex , which makes more sense once a beginner like me goes into depth of ever Keyword popping on IDE .
