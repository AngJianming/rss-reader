These tools don‚Äôt just provide sources‚Äîthey help students understand legal reasoning faster by offering plain-language explanations and suggestions.\nAI as a Personal Legal Tutor: Some professors and schools are integrating AI chatbots like ChatGPT to help students refine arguments, practice exam questions, and get real-time feedback on their reasoning. It‚Äôs like having a virtual TA on call 24/7.\nEnhanced Classroom Learning: AI tools can generate hypothetical cases, simulate negotiations, or assist in moot court prep. Instructors are also using generative AI to personalize content, quiz prep, and course materials.\nWith law firms increasingly relying on AI, students are learning to use these tools early‚Äîso they‚Äôre practice-ready from day one. Knowing how to collaborate with AI is becoming a core skill, not just a tech bonus.\nAI is becoming an essential companion in legal education.
