          "description": "\"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.\" — Harold Abelson\nPicture this: you've just created an amazing in-memory data store that works flawlessly during your program's execution. But here's the catch—every restart sends your precious data into oblivion. Sound familiar? This is where data serialization becomes your lifeline.\nToday, we're exploring the foundation that makes database persistence possible. While it might seem like a detour from actual database construction, mastering serialization is essential for any storage system that needs to survive beyond a single program execution.\nThink about moving houses with fragile antiques. You have two options: risk carrying everything intact (and potentially losing it all with one mistake), or…",
