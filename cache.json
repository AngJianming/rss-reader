          "description": "🛡️ How I Resolved the “Malicious App” Warning on Phantom Wallet Extension\n\n\nIf you're building a dApp or browser extension that interacts with the Phantom Wallet, and you've seen your app flagged as malicious, you’re not alone. i got the same on my token manager Dapp Solana token manager\nI recently ran into this issue, and after some debugging and a successful resolution, I thought I’d share my experience. If you're seeing similar warnings and want to remove the \"malicious app\" label, here's how to go about it.\nPhantom Wallet sometimes flags apps or extensions that interact with wallets in an unsafe or suspicious way. This can happen if:\nYou manually sign and send transactions using raw methods.\nYou bypass Phantom's secure APIs.\nYour code behaves like a phishing attack (even if unintentionally).\nThis results in a scary warning for users, which harms trust and adoption.\nsignAndSendTransaction\n\n\nThe key is to use Phantom’s secure APIs correctly. Specifically, instead of signing and sending transactions manually like this:\nconst signedTransaction = await signTransaction(transaction);\nconst txId = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTransaction.serialize());\nawait connection.confirmTransaction(txId, 'confirmed');\n\nSwitch to Phantom’s recommended helper method:\n const provider = getProvider();\n  const { signature } = await provider.signAndSendTransaction(transaction);\n  await connection.getSignatureStatus(signature);\n\n🔒 Why this works\n📧 Still Flagged? Request a Manual Review\n✉️ Email: review@phantom.app\nYour project name\nGitHub or website URL\nCode snippets showing secure API usage\n✅ Checklist to Avoid Being Flagged\nUse signAndSendTransaction instead of raw signing/sending.\nAvoid modifying the transaction structure after signing.\nDo not inject hidden fields or overwrite wallet methods.\nDon’t request excessive permissions.\nMake your code open-source if possible (helps with review).",

          "description": "Best Practices for Async Error Handling in JavaScript\n\n\nJavaScript has undergone significant evolution since its inception in 1995, transitioning from a simple scripting language primarily designed for client-side web interactivity to a powerhouse of modern web application development. With the rise of asynchronous programming, particularly with the introduction of Promises and async/await patterns, JavaScript has transformed how developers write non-blocking code. However, this evolution has also introduced complexities, especially in error handling within asynchronous contexts.

From the first primitive drums to complex orchestral symphonies, musical art has been shaped by human imagination, emotion, and technique. However, we are experiencing a silent revolution that is fundamentally redefining how we think about music creation: the rise of Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThis transformation isn't just a technological curiosity or academic experiment.

          "description": "If you’ve ever worked on more than one Node.js project, chances are you’ve run into the dreaded “Wrong Node version” problem. One app needs Node v10, another uses v18, and suddenly you’re uninstalling and reinstalling Node.js every 15 minutes.\nYeah. It sucks.\nThe good news? There’s a much better way to manage this. It’s called NVM (Node Version Manager) — and yes, it works on Windows too! 🙌\nLet me show you how to set it up.\nIf you already have Node.js installed, go ahead and remove it. NVM will take care of installing and managing Node for you.\nOpen the Control Panel\n\nGo to Programs → Uninstall a program\n\nFind Node.js, right-click it, and choose Uninstall\n\n\n\n\nThis step helps avoid conflicts down the line.\nNow grab the Windows version of NVM from the official GitHub repo:\n👉 Download NVM for Windows\nScroll to the latest release\nDownload the file called nvm-setup.exe\n\nRun the installer\nJust follow the prompts:\nLeave the default install path (or pick your own)\nIt’ll ask for the Node.js installation path — again, the default is fine\nFinish the setup\nBoom. NVM is now installed.\nOpen a new terminal window (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and type:\nnvm version\n\nIf you see a version number, you’re all set!\nLet’s test it out.\nnvm install 16.20.0\n\nWant Node v10 for an old project?\nnvm install 10.12.0\n\nnvm use 16.20.0\n\nThat’s it. Now when you run:\nnode -v\n\nYou’ll see the version you just switched to.\nnvm list\n\nnvm uninstall 10.12.0\n\nIf nvm doesn’t work right away, restart your terminal (or open it as Admin).\nEvery version of Node you install via NVM is isolated — which means your global packages won’t carry over.\n\nWant to go back to the system-installed Node? Just type:\n\n\n\n\n  nvm off\n\nNVM is honestly one of the best tools you can install as a Node developer. It saves time, reduces headaches, and makes working on multiple projects way smoother.\nNo more uninstalling Node every week. No more version errors. Just run the version you need and get back to coding.\nHappy hacking! 💻⚡",
