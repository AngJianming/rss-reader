          "description": "Microsoft Excel is a powerful tool used across the world typically in organizing and visualizing data. While most people use it for simple tasks such as creating graphs and tables with scanty knowledge in graphs, Excel can do much more and this explains why almost around 70% of companies solely rely on it to run their businesses.\n\nExcel is widely used for examining and analyzing data in different industries. In the business world, companies rely on Excel to predict their sales, measure their progress, and manage all their inventory. The application allows managers to see patterns and trends more easily, enabling them to make sound decisions from it. In finance, Excel allows professional practitioners to prepare both income statements and balance sheets, as well as budgeting documents. Fina…",

          "description": "You’ve probably used operators like &, |, ^, or ~ in Python before. They're called bitwise operators because they work at the level of binary digits, or bits. So instead of working with whole numbers or booleans, they deal with the 0s and 1s that make up numbers underneath. But have you ever wondered how Python knows what to do when you write a & b? Or how you can make your own class respond to those operators?\nThat’s where bitwise special methods come in, things like __and__, __or__, __xor__, etc. They let you control how bitwise operators work on custom objects, just like how __add__ lets you control +.\nLet’s break it all down in simple terms, with code and practical ideas you can actually use.\nBitwise special methods are part of Python's “dunder methods”.

However, Python has a built-in document function for every built-in function, making it easier to understand how to use them. In this challenge, you will write a program to print out the documents for some of Python's built-in functions, such as str(), sorted(), and input(), as well as adding a document for your own function.\nPractice on LabEx → | Tutorial →\n\nDifficulty: Beginner | Time: 5 minutes\nThis program finds all the numbers between 2000 and 2200 (both included) that are divisible by 7 but not a multiple of 5.

These media files weren’t their own objects—they were just stored as a list of URL strings inside each bucket item. Initially, this was fine for displaying content. But as the app grew, so did the pain.\nThe Breaking Point: Thumbnails and Deletion Logic\nBecause I stored only the video URLs directly in the bucket item, I had no structured place to associate a thumbnail. My “solution” at the time? I created a Map inside the item, where the video URL was the key and the thumbnail URL was the value.\nThis led to a mess:\nTo delete a video, I had to first check if it was a video or image.\nThen, if it was a video, look up its thumbnail URL in the map.\nThen delete the thumbnail, then the video, then update the entire bucket item’s data.\nIt felt like hacking around the lack of a proper data model.\nA Cleaner, More Industry-Standard Design\nThe benefits:\n✅ Easier deletions and edits\n✅ Cleaner separation of concerns\n✅ Better scalability\n✅ More intuitive and modular logic\nOld Design\n\nNew Design\n\nTakeaway\nAnd most importantly?
