          "description": "TL;DR:\n\nIf you think Model Context Protocol (MCP) is just a boring tool registry, think again. It’s more like giving your AI a Swiss Army knife—with a concierge who hands over exactly the right tool at exactly the right moment. Each AI session is isolated, reducing chaos and preventing leaks, and everything is logged like a black box flight recorder. \nLet’s get one thing straight: MCP is not just a static tool registry. Sure, it lets your AI discover available functions or APIs—but calling it a registry is like calling a Swiss Army knife “just some blades.”\nWhat sets MCP apart is its context-driven, session-specific dynamic tooling. Your AI doesn't sift through a buffet of random tools—it gets a curated menu based on who the user is, what the session needs, and what permissions apply.\nThis…",

Two critical metrics that define a token’s health are velocity and slippage.

This is where TDMM (Transparent Decentralized Market Making) steps in, offering a next-gen solution that balances liquidity, reduces slippage, and aligns incentives.\n🔁 What Is Token Velocity?\nWhy It Matters for Projects:\nHigh velocity = Risk of token dumping\n📉 What Is Slippage?\nWhy It Matters for Users:\nHigh slippage = Poor user experience\nHigh slippage deters users from trading the token\n✅ 2. Transparent Market Making Algorithms\n✅ 3. Incentivized Liquidity Mining\n✅ 4.

The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. \nGlassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…",
