It will combine principle explanations, code implementations, and visual structure displays to help readers understand the core mechanisms of neural networks.  \nA neural network is a computational model that simulates biological neurons, achieving non-linear mapping through connections of nodes across multiple layers. A typical three-layer neural network structure includes an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Nodes in each layer are connected via weights and biases, and inter-layer transmission is processed through activation functions. Below is a schem…",

Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. \nInvestigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. \nThe stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
