Apesar de sua simplicidade, o KNN pode apresentar alto desempenho em diversos contextos, desde sistemas de recomendação até diagnósticos médicos. Neste artigo, exploramos seu funcionamento, aplicações práticas e vantagens e desvantagens, com uma implementação básica em Python.\nEm tempos de hype com redes neurais profundas e modelos generativos como os LLMs, é fácil esquecer os algoritmos que formam a base da IA tradicional. O KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) é um desses algoritmos: simples, eficaz e fácil de enten…",

          "description": "作为一名沉浸在计算机科学世界的大三学生，我的日常早已被代码的逻辑与算法的魅力所占据。然而，理论的海洋虽然广阔，实践的浪花才最能检验真理。在参与了几个校园项目和一些开源社区的贡献后，我愈发感受到，选择一个合适的开发框架，对于项目的成败、开发效率乃至最终的用户体验，起着至关重要的作用。最近，一款基于Rust语言构建的Web后端框架，以其石破天惊的性能表现和独树一帜的设计哲学，彻底颠覆了我对“高效”与“现代”Web开发的认知。今天，我想以一个探索者的身份，结合我那“十年老编”对文字的挑剔和“十年开发者”对技术的苛求，与大家分享我与这款“下一代Web引擎”的深度体验，以及它那令人叹为服指的性能制胜之道。\n初识Rust：性能与安全的双重奏\n在正式接触这款框架之前，我对Rust语言的了解，多半停留在“内存安全”、“并发性能优越”这些标签式的印象上。直到我为了理解这款框架的底层逻辑，开始系统学习Rust，才真正领略到这门语言的精妙之处。它没有垃圾回收器（GC），却通过一套严格的所有权（Ownership）、借用（Borrowing）和生命周期（Lifetimes）系统，在编译期就杜绝了绝大多数内存安全问题，如空指针解引用、数据竞争等。这对于构建需要长时间稳定运行、且对资源控制要求极高的后端服务而言，简直是天赐的福音。\n以往在使用一些带有GC的语言开发时，我们常常需要为GC停顿（Stop-the-World）带来的性能抖动而烦恼，尤其是在高并发场景下，GC的不可预测性往往成为性能瓶颈的根源。而Rust，从根本上消除了这一顾虑。它的性能表现，更接近于C/C++这类系统级编程语言，但又提供了远超后者的开发体验和安全性保障。这让我想起一位资深架构师曾分享的观点：“选择技术栈，就像选择武器，既要锋利，更要趁手，且不能伤到自己。”Rust，在我看来，就是这样一把兼具锋芒与安全的“神兵利器”。\n这款框…",

          "description": "The burgeoning digital landscape, while offering unprecedented convenience and innovation, comes with a hidden environmental cost. Data centers alone consume a staggering 2% of the world's electricity, and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector's greenhouse gas emissions are comparable to those of the aviation industry. As software permeates every facet of our lives, the individual developer's role in mitigating this impact becomes increasingly critical. Green coding, a practical approach to sustainable software development, moves beyond theoretical discussions to offer actionable, code-level strategies that can significantly reduce the environmental footprint of IT systems.

          "description": "Hyperlane：新一代高性能Rust框架的实战体验\n\n\n作为一名大三计算机专业的学生，我在最近的课程项目中深入使用了 Hyperlane 框架。这个被称为\"新一代轻量级高性能框架\"的 Rust Web 框架确实给我留下了深刻印象。本文将从实战角度，分享我对 Hyperlane 的使用体验。\n在项目开始时，我对比了几个主流的 Web 框架：\n\n\n\n框架\n依赖模型\n异步运行时\n中间件支持\nSSE/WebSocket\n路由匹配能力\n\n\n\n\nHyperlane\n仅依赖 Tokio + 标准库\nTokio\n✅ 支持请求/响应\n✅ 原生支持\n✅ 支持正则表达式\n\n\nActix-Web\n较多内部抽象层\nActix\n✅ 请求中间件\n部分支持(需插件)\n⚠️ 路径宏需显式配置\n\n\nAxum\n复杂的 Tower 架构\nTokio\n✅ Tower 中间件\n✅ 需依赖扩展\n⚠️ 动态路由较弱\n\n\n\n最终选择 Hyperlane 的原因是：\n极简的依赖关系\n完整的异步支持\n原生的 WebSocket 集成\n灵活的路由系统\nserver.enable_nodelay().await;\nserver.disable_linger().await;\nserver.http_line_buffer_size(4096).await;\n\nHyperlane 默认启用了这些性能优化选项，这意味着它为高并发连接场景预设了合适的 TCP 和缓冲区参数。\n在实际项目中，我使用 wrk 进行了压力测试：\nwrk -c360 -d60s http://localhost:8000/\n\n测试结果令人惊喜：\n\n\n\n框架\nQPS\n内存占用\n\n\n\n\nHyperlane\n324,323\n最低\n\n\nRocket\n298,945\n中等\n\n\nGin (Go)\n242,570\n较高\n\n\n\nserver\n    .host(\"0.0.0.0\").await\n    .port(60000).await\n    .route(\"/\", root_route).await\n    .route(\"/goods/{id:\\\\d+}\", goods_detail).await\n    .run().await\n    .unwrap();\n\n所有配置都采用异步链式调用模式，无需嵌套配置或宏组合。\n#[get]\nasync fn ws_route(ctx: Context) {\n    let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();\n    ctx.set_response_body(key)\n        .await\n        .send_body()\n        .await;\n}\n\n原生的 WebSocket 支持让实时消息推送变得简单。\n#[post]\nasync fn sse_route(ctx: Context) {\n    ctx.set_response_header(CONTENT_TYPE, TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)\n        .await\n        .send()\n        .await;\n\n    for i in 0..10 {\n        ctx.set_response_body(format!(\"data:{}{}\", i, HTTP_DOUBLE_BR))\n            .await\n            .send_body()\n            .await;\n    }\n}\n\n零平台依赖：纯 Rust 实现，跨平台一致性强\n极致性能优化：底层 I/O 使用 Tokio 的 TcpStream 和异步缓冲\n灵活的中间件机制：支持请求和响应中间件，生命周期划分清晰\n开箱即用的实时通信：原生支持 WebSocket 和 SSE\nv4.22.0 后，ctx.aborted() 可以中断请求\nv5.25.1 中的 ctx.closed() 可以主动关闭连接\n从简单路由开始：先熟悉基本的 GET/POST 路由\n理解 Context 抽象：这是框架的核心概念\n循序渐进学习中间件：先使用内置中间件，再尝试自定义\n关注性能优化选项：了解默认配置的作用\n探索在微服务架构中的应用\n研究与其他 Rust 生态系统的集成\n尝试贡献一些社区插件\n作为一个学生开发者，我认为 Hyperlane 是一个非常值得投入时间学习的框架。它不仅让我深入理解了 Web 开发的本质，还让我体会到了 Rust 在 Web 领域的强大潜力。如果你也在寻找一个性能强大且易于上手的 Rust Web 框架，Hyperlane 绝对值得一试！",
