          "description": "If you look around, it's pretty much impossible not to have heard something about AI, especially these Large Language Models (LLMs), right? As if you knew these GPTs, Llamas, Claudes, and all that. As if these have already become part of our lives.\nIt's lovely to ask an LLM one question and get one answer. But how about giving it your entire customer support operation? Or asking it to handle a big research project from beginning to end? This is where a standalone LLM, no matter how smart, falls a little short. It's like having a super-powerful brain but no arms or legs.\nA single LLM is like a wonderful solo musician. It can perform wonders. But sometimes you require a symphony-an orchestra where various instruments play in coordination with each other in perfect harmony. That is precisely …",

          "description": "Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.\nWallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.\nPower like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …",

          "description": "This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. \nBut this attainment is not about one company alone. \n“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. \nJason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the …",
