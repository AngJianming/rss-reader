          "description": "In today's cloud-native world, containers have become the standard deployment unit for applications. Yet despite Docker's widespread adoption, a surprising number of organizations struggle with inefficient, insecure, and problematic Dockerfiles. These issues silently drain productivity, increase costs, and introduce security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle.\nThe numbers tell a concerning story:\nThe average container image in enterprise environments is 650MB - often 2-3x larger than necessary\nDevelopers spend an average of 15-20 minutes daily waiting for Docker builds to complete\n87% of container images contain at least one high or critical vulnerability\nOnly 35% of organizations have automated container security scanning\nThese statistics represent enormous waste across …",

Here are some key points from 𝗔𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗰 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁𝘀 by James Clear, along with simple examples to help you apply them:\n𝟭. 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗛𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁𝘀:\nKeep a simple log or calendar. For example, mark an “X” every day you meditate. Visual progress motivates you to keep going.\n𝟮. 𝗡𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗠𝗶𝘀𝘀 𝗧𝘄𝗶𝗰𝗲:\nMissing a day is okay, but don’t let it turn into two days. If you skip your workout once, commit to doing it the very next day.\n𝟯. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗦𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹:\nBegin with tiny actions, like reading one page or doing 2 minutes of exercise. This makes habits easy to start and maintain.\n𝟰. 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗖𝘂𝗲𝘀:\nPlace reminders in your environment. Lay out your workout clothes the night before to cue morning exercise.\n𝟱. 𝗥𝗲𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲𝗹𝗳:\nFinish your habit with a small reward — like enjoying a cup of coffee after completing a task — to reinforce the behaviour.\n𝟲. 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗡𝗼𝘁 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗢𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲𝘀:\nFocus on becoming “the type of person who writes daily,” rather than just finishing a book.\nSmall changes add up to big results over time — consistency beats intensity!\n𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗵𝗮𝗯𝗶𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗱𝗲 𝗮 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗲?

          "description": "Ever built something that needed real-time updates and found yourself wondering if HTTP alone could cut it? I’ve been there too. In this post, I’ll walk you through the key differences between HTTP and WebSocket, technologies you’ll often encounter when building modern web applications.\nWhat’s the Core Difference?\nBoth HTTP and WebSocket are protocols used for communication between a client and a server. But they operate very differently and that matters a lot depending on what you're building.\nHTTP: Request-Response, Stateless\nHTTP is the way the web communicates. A client (like your browser) sends a request, and the server sends a response. That’s it. Once the transaction is done, the connection usually closes.\nGreat for:\n- Web pages\n\n- REST APIs\n\n- Static resources\n\nNot so great for:\n- Anything that needs real-time data updates\n\nWebSocket: Full-Duplex, Persistent\nWebSocket is designed for continuous, two-way communication. After an initial handshake over HTTP, the connection upgrades to WebSocket and stays open. Both client and server can push messages to each other anytime.\nPerfect for:\n- Live chat\n\n- Online games\n\n- Stock tickers\n\nCollaborative editing tools\n\nHTTP runs securely over HTTPS. Well supported, widely used, and easy to scale.\n\nWebSocket uses WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted traffic. Requires a bit more care in implementation, especially with authentication and origin checks.\n\nBoth protocols are supported by all modern browsers and most cloud/server infrastructures.\nIf your app:\nOnly needs data when a user does something (like clicking a button)\n\nIs stateless or RESTful\n\n✅ Use HTTP\nIf your app:\nNeeds to send or receive data without user action\n\nUpdates in real-time\n\n🔥 Go with WebSocket\nWhether you're building a chat app or just exploring backend development, understanding the difference between HTTP and WebSocket will help you design smarter, more efficient systems.\nLet me know your thoughts or experiences in the comments",
