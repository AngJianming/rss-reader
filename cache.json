I love the more \"human\" outputs \nIn this case, the documents for DeepSeek to analyze are a three-part story about a man who learned through experience \nTo create my prompt, I'll first set the context :\nI am a researcher, and I need your help with 3 documents; I will upload them, and you will analyze them.\nNext, I will break down the tasks:\nyou will provide a short summary of the documents, along with a list of important points from the documents (bullet points), and you will hold a question and answer session…",

The code is valid (TS valid I mean), despite not achieving the initial goal.\nThat was quick, but I hope it helped.\nTo sum up,\n\"any\" means \"zero constraint\".\n\"T\" means \"has at least one constraint\".\nHope it helped!\nDavid.",

Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.\nBitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.\nMichael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin.

The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.\nWhile blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…",
