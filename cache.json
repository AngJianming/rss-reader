          "description": "We all know the rule: \"Don’t talk to strangers.\"\nBut here’s the twist: Some of the bravest career decisions I’ve seen recently started with breaking that rule.\nOver the past few weeks, developers from all kinds of backgrounds booked free 1-on-1 growth calls with me, a total stranger. No job offer. No catch. Just 30 minutes to reflect on where they are and where they want to go.\nAnd you know what? That first step, scheduling the call and showing up, was the real moment of growth.\nNot the frameworks.\nJust choosing courage over comfort.\nMany developers feel stuck, overwhelmed, or unsure of their next move. They think they need more skills, more courses, or more \"readiness.\"\nBut often, what they actually need is…\n\n💬 a conversation\na listener\na bit of clarity from someone outside their own head\nGrowth doesn't have to be loud. Sometimes, it starts quietly: with a message, a call, a stranger who’s been there before.\nYes. If that stranger is someone who’s walked the path and wants to help, do it.\nTake the call. Ask the question. Start the conversation that scares you a little.\nIt might be the bravest, smartest move you make all year.\nWant to talk to a stranger? You know where to find me!\nhttps://calendly.com/tim-lorent/free-30-minute-growth-call-for-developers",

          "description": "In modern construction and interior design, special attention is given to combining functionality with aesthetics. One of the best solutions that meets these requirements is lift and slide doors. These innovative doors are rapidly gaining popularity thanks to their ease of use, stylish appearance, and high energy efficiency.\nUnlike traditional sliding doors, lift and slide doors offer improved sealing and durability. The lifting mechanism allows the door panel to slightly raise when opening, enabling smooth and silent gliding along the track. When closed, the door lowers and fits tightly against the seals, providing reliable protection against drafts, moisture, and noise. This significantly enhances thermal insulation and helps reduce heating and cooling costs.\nLarge glass panels used in lift and slide doors maximize natural light penetration into the room and create the effect of a seamless transition between interior and exterior spaces. Such doors are especially relevant for homes with views of a garden, terrace, or pool — they visually expand the living area and give the room a modern and elegant look.\nFrom a design perspective, lift and slide doors are highly versatile. They come in various materials — aluminum, wood, and combinations — allowing you to choose the optimal option to match any building style. Additionally, there are different finishing and color options that will harmoniously fit your interior or exterior.\nSecurity is another advantage of these doors. Modern models are equipped with multi-point locking systems, making unauthorized access difficult. This makes lift and slide doors an excellent choice for those who value comfort and home protection.\nIf you are planning a renovation or construction and want to invest in a durable, convenient, and stylish solution, we recommend considering lift and slide doors. They will not only improve the functionality of your home but also significantly increase its market value.",

Alongside Edge Functions, it's a powerful tool that enables developers to achieve enhanced functionality and performance. Middleware was introduced in Next.js v12 and has been improved in consecutive versions. Starting with Next.js v13, middleware can be used to respond directly to requests without going through the route handler. \nThis can improve performance and security. Middleware can also be used to work with Vercel Edge Functions. Edge Functions allow you to run code at the network's edge.

          "description": "The International Monetary Fund said it has reached an agreement with El Salvador to pay the country $120 million following an initial review of its $1.4 billion loan agreement struck last year.\nThe IMF said on May 27 that as part of the deal, El Salvador will need to fulfill its prior obligations around limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin (BTC), and it will have to cease its involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July.\n“On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said.\nThe planned payout, subject to IMF executive board approval, is part of a larger $1.4 billion, 40-month loan deal struck in December, which saw El Salvador agree to confine its Bitcoin ambiti…",
