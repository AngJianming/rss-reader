          "description": "Associations between primary and sub tables, like orders and order details tables, are quite common. SQL uses JOIN to perform such associations, but performance often suffers significantly when both tables are large.\n\nesProc supports the ordered merge algorithm, which can greatly improve primary-subtable join performance. To illustrate this, we‚Äôll compare the performance of esProc SPL and MySQL using an example involving orders and order details tables.\nThe MySQL database contains an orders table (10 million records) with primary key oid (order ID) and fields cid (customer ID) and odate (order date). The details table (30 million records) has a composite primary key of oid and did (detail ID), with fields quantity, price, and pid (product ID).\nTest environment: VMware virtual machine with ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Data types matter in SQL. Whether you‚Äôre comparing values or formatting results, type mismatches can cause problems. That‚Äôs where the CAST function comes in‚Äîit converts data types explicitly, cleanly, and consistently. Let‚Äôs look at how to use it effectively.\nCAST Examples\n\n\nString to Integer\nSELECT CAST('100' AS INT);\n\nFloat to INT\nSELECT CAST(42.69 AS SIGNED);\n\nINT to Decimal\nSELECT CAST(3 AS DECIMAL);\n\nString to Date\nSELECT CAST('2024-12-21' AS DATE);\n\nINT to String\nSELECT CAST(42 AS CHAR);\n\nBest Practices\n\n\n\nUse CAST when explicit conversion improves clarity.\nAvoid casting unless required‚Äîsome conversions happen automatically.\nPrefer date-specific functions for formatting over generic casting.\nBe cautious with numeric rounding.\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Is CAST cross-database?\n\n\nYes, it follows the SQL standard.\nOnly compatible ones‚Äîcheck your DB docs.\nCAST is standard. CONVERT is SQL Server. :: is PostgreSQL-only.\nUsually returns NULL or triggers an error.\nConclusion\n\n\nSQL's CAST function is your go-to tool for converting values clearly and safely across database platforms. Mastering it helps you write better queries and handle mixed data with confidence. Want to simplify conversions even further? Try DbVisualizer to inspect and convert data visually.
