There is 2 ways of doing this.\nbag of words (CBOW)\nskip-gram\nThey are the opposite of each other. In CBOW, given the context word, it predicts the output word.

This helps avoid surprises and allows teams to make faster, smarter decisions.\nHow Dynamics 365 F&SCM Enables Real-Time Inventory Control\n1. Unified Data Platform\n2. Warehouse and Location Management\n3. Inventory Dimensions and Tracking\n4. Mobile Scanning and RFID Integration\n5. Automatic Replenishment and Planning\nBenefits of Real-Time Inventory Control\nImproved Order Fulfillment\nWith up-to-date inventory data, your team can fulfill orders more accurately and avoid delays. Customers get what they ordered, when they expect it, and with fewer errors.\n2. Reduced Stockouts and Overstocking\n3. Better Forecasting and Planning\n4. Enhanced Collaboration Across Departments\nIncreased Operational Efficiency\nReal-time tracking reduces manual effort and improves accuracy. Employees spend less time double-checking stock levels or correcting errors and more time on value-added tasks.\nFinal Thoughts\nWhether you’re managing a single warehouse or a complex global supply chain, the ability to track inventory in real time gives your business the edge it needs to compete and grow.\nIf you’re ready to move beyond outdated systems and take full control of your inventory, Dynamics 365 F&SCM is a powerful solution worth exploring.",
