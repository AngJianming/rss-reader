This framing—whether through media, corporate messaging, or staged interactions—functions as an intelligence operation designed to control perception, induce compliance, and concentrate power. We argue that AI is being exploited not only through its outputs, but as an exploit itself: a psychological vector targeting deeply rooted human biases. The danger is not that AI has come alive, but that people are being led to believe it has. This manufactured belief, often fueled by hype and misrepresentation, creates vulnerabilities that can be systematically exploited for various ends, ranging from commercial influence to geopolitical maneu…",

They broadcast broad messages into millions of homes, hoping something would stick—that, somehow, their ads would resonate among the faceless masses.

Imagine an advertisement crafted just for you—attuned to your taste, your needs, your moments.

I like the language because I feel it is versatile. I do like the statically typed nature of the language as well, which helps reduce the risk of errors at runtime. C# also has phenomenal support and documentation. It being part of the Microsoft environment also makes it a safe choice for the job market. I also find using Python to be enjoyable, having used the language to solve problems in Codewars. I also had a class back in college using PHP, and I enjoyed it; I hope to revisit the language someday.\nThere are programming languages that I look forward to trying in the future. I desire to learn a language that is not as well-known as some other languages. I think this would be a unique and exciting challenge. The language I want to try is Crystal. What interests me about Crystal is its Ruby-like syntax (another language I want to try more), and it's statically typed, similar to the C languages and Java. Their slogan is that Crystal is a language \"for humans and computers,\" which sounds terrific. Another language that piques my interest would be the Pony programming language. The languages appears to take a unique approach to certain aspects of coding, so I think it could be an excellent learning experience.",

Naturally, instead of just watching it and moving on like a normal person, my brain went:\nYeah…I do not understand how my brain works either.\nIt struck me how many recent blockbusters seem to follow similar themes: superheroes (still going strong, somehow), explosive action flicks, and horror films (which I respectfully avoid because I enjoy sleeping at night). So rather than doing what a reasonable human might do, and just do a simple Google search, I built an entire Python scraper (which, to be honest, was done only because I really wanted to have a data-mining project, but let’s just pretend like it was an attempt at being bold, quirky, and different).\nMy script pulls the current Top 25 movies from IMDb (technically Top 50, but I was only able to fetch the Top 25, more details in the repo), grabs each one’s plot summary, and then generates a word cloud from all that text. The result? A visual answer to the question: “What are audiences being served most often right now, plot-wise?” And as a bonus, I made it work for specific genres too, so you can visualize what “sells” in action, comedy, or even horror (if you're braver than me).\nWhat I Learned:\n\n\nThis wasn’t just a fun little project that I worked on, my main goal was to learn a lot of new stuff along the way:\nData cleaning & preprocessing using tools like NLTK (stopwords, tokenization)\nWeb scraping with requests and BeautifulSoup\n\nVisualizing data using WordCloud and matplotlib\n\nHandling website structure quirks and anti-bot headers\nUsing time.sleep() to avoid hammering IMDb’s servers (being nice to websites)\nHas This Been Done Before?\nBut was it worth building myself?\n\nAs a bonus, it also fetches the most common genres:",
