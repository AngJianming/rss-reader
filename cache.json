In this post, I’ll walk you through how I’m developing a mobile health app that combines traditional herbal knowledge with modern AI technologies using Flutter, TensorFlow Lite, and Gemini (or GPT).\nThe vision is to create a mobile-first health companion that can:\nIdentify local herbs using the phone camera\nExplain their uses, preparation methods, and dosage\nSuggest first-aid remedies using indigenous knowledge\nOffer lifestyle and diet advice for mental and physical well-being\nFlutter – Cross-platform development\nTensorFlow Lite – For image recognition of herbs\nGemini / GPT-4 – For generating dynamic health advice\nFirebase – Backend services\nIsar – Local database for offline access\nUsers can take a photo of a herb, and the app uses a TFLite model to identify it. Once identified, it fetches relevant medicinal info.\nUsing Gemini/GPT, the app can answer health-related questions and suggest herbal remedies.\nWith Isar, most core info about herbs and remedies is available offline, especially helpful in remote areas.\nThe app includes simple illustrated first-aid instructions based on both modern and traditional techniques.\nI aim for a minimal, culturally respectful design that includes:\nSoft earthy tones\nIconography inspired by nature\nOffline-friendly interfaces\nBeta testing with real users\nCollaborating with local herbalists and communities\nIntegrating multilingual support (Shona, Swahili, etc.)\nThis app isn’t just about tech—it’s about preserving heritage, improving health accessibility, and blending ancestral wisdom with modern innovation.\nAre you working on a similar project? I'd love to connect and learn from you!\nLet’s build a future that respects the past. 🌱\n📬 Feel free to drop questions or feedback in the comments below!",

          "description": "How does HTTPS work?\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of HTTP that utilizes Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt communication between a client and server. Any intercepted data will be unreadable and secure from tampering and eavesdropping.\nWhat's the process for encrypting and decrypting data?\nThe journey begins with the client (like your browser) establishing a TCP connection with the server.\nNext comes the “client hello” where the browser sends a message containing supported cipher suites and the highest TLS version it can handle. Cipher suites are sets of algorithms that typically include: a key exchange method to share keys between devices, a bulk encryption algorithm to encrypt data, and a message authentication code algorithm to check data integrity.\nThe server responds with a “server hello”, confirming the chosen cipher suite and TLS version that they can both understand. The server then sends a TLS certificate to the client containing its domain name, certificate authority signature, and the server’s public key. The client checks this certificate to validate it is trusted and belongs to the server.\nOnce the TLS certificate is validated, the client creates a session key to be used for encrypting the bulk data transfer. Bulk data transfer refers to the transmission of the actual application data between client and server once the secure TLS connection is established. To securely send this session key to the server, it’s encrypted with the server’s public key. The server, with its private key, is the only one who can decrypt this encrypted session key.\nNow that both parties have the secret session key, they shift gears to symmetric encryption. It’s like they’ve agreed on a private language that only they understand. This makes the data transfer very secure. Symmetric encryption is much faster for large amounts of data.\n@synacyb",
