I referenced design challenges from Frontend Mentor, which helped sharpen my skills with hands-on layout building and responsiveness.\n\n\n📚 What I Studied:\n\n\n🛠️ What I Coded (Highlights):\nOrder Summary Component\n\nLive Demo: Link\nLink\n\n\n\n\nChose this component because it’s highly practical — useful for nearly any future eCommerce-related project.\n\n\nPracticed modular structuring and styling, following BEM naming convention.\n\nLanding Page for Tech Book Club\n\n\nLive Demo: Link\nLink\n\n\nTook over 12 hours to complete. Laying out every element and handling media queries (desktop, tablet, mobile) felt tedious — but it gave me deep, practical exposure to responsive design.\nI realized that using tools like React or Tailwind CSS later on could streamline this process significantly. Despite the time investment, it laid a strong foundation for future landing page projects.\n\n\n✨ Things I Learned from the Landing Page Build:\nGradient Text Effects\nUsed background-clip, -webkit-background-clip, and -webkit-text-fill-color to create text with a gradient fill.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid Background with Gradient Overlay\nBuilt a custom 3-layer background:\nHorizontal lines\nVertical lines\nA gradient overlay for depth and style\n\n\n\n\n\nEmphasis with Pseudo-elements\nApplied a circle pattern image using ::before pseudo-element to highlight key words visually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Reflection:\nI still feel slow when positioning elements and writing responsive CSS, but I remind myself that this is part of the learning curve. I'm sure it will become easier the more I build. Next!",

Instead of managing multiple YAML files or commenting out services, profiles allow you to group services and enable them selectively with a single command.\nDefine a profile in your docker-compose.yml under a service’s profiles key.
