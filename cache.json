And why is everyone talking about it?\nIn this post, I‚Äôll explain what generative AI is in a clear and approachable way. \n1. What is generative AI?\nGenerative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content. Unlike traditional AI, which mainly classifies or analyzes data, generative models are capable of producing text, images, code, music, video, even voices, all from scratch.\nThe word \"generative\" comes from this ability to generate original content based on what it has learned.\n2. How does it learn?\nGenerative AI is trained using a special type of model called a generative model, which learns patterns from massive datasets.\nFor e‚Ä¶",
