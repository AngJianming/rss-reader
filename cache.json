          "description": "I wrote this content originally on my website : https://alsohelp.com/blog/typescript-get-all-but-last-element\nWhereas the answer is initially pretty straightforward, this blog article is mostly for beginners, and how to think about code readability for others.\nHere is the article :\nWhat if you want to get all elements but the last one inside an array in TypeScript ?\nWell, it's a JS feature, that should be relevant in any environment.\nThe answer is\n// remove only the last element of array a\nlet b = a.slice(0, -1);\n// a is left as-is\n// b is all but the last element\n\nA more complete TS example would be\nconst a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst result = a.slice(0, -1);\nconsole.log(result); // Will output [1, 2, 3]\nconsole.log(a); // Will output [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nHowever, I'm not 100% satisfied with that.\nIt works, and has no side-effect, which means you can confidently pipe the output.\nBut it's not very readable.\nThere is no a.getAllButLastElement, which would be a lot more convenient to read (and to remember!)\nSo if you want to avoid over-engineering, you have no other option than commenting directly the code :\nconst a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst result = a.slice(0, -1); // remove last elt only\nconsole.log(result);\nconsole.log(a);\n\nMmh works, it is readable, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with that.\nIt's not re-usable accross the project\nSo finally I would use something like this :\nfunction allButLast<T>(arr: T[]): T[] {\n  return arr.slice(0, -1);\n}\n\nconst a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nconst result = allButLast(a);\n\nconsole.log(result);\nconsole.log(a);\n\nGood!\nNow this is reusable, and self-documented.\nSo that's it for today, solve this was not a big deal, but you can notice how to tackle elegantly a simple problem on real-world projects.\nBest,\nDavid",

If you're managing a WordPress site, especially one with many plugins, themes, or client contributors, you need a plan to detect unauthorized file changes before they turn into real security problems.\nThat‚Äôs where the Recent File Scanner plugin has made a big difference for me.\n*What is Recent File Scanner?\n\nRecent File Scanner is a lightweight plugin I created (and now use on all my sites) that scans your WordPress installation for recently added files ‚Äî specifically in the /wp-content/plugins/ and /wp-content/themes/ directories.\nYou can configure it to check files created in the last:\n1 day\n3 days\n7 days\nor any custom number of days!\nThis makes it easy to catch:\nUnauthorized uploads\nHidden backdoors from malware\nUnexplained file additions after a plugin update or migration\n*Real-World Use Cases\n\nHere are a few situations where this plugin saved the day:\nüîç 1. Post-Hack Investigation\nüë• 2. Client Site Monitoring\nAfter Migrations or Plugin Updates\nWhether restoring a backup or installing a new plugin, I run a quick scan for anything unexpected. It‚Äôs peace of mind I didn‚Äôt know I needed.\n*Other Tips to Keep Your WordPress Site Secure\n\nWhile Recent File Scanner is a great tool, here are more must-do tips:\n‚úÖ Keep everything updated\n‚úÖ Install a firewall plugin\n‚úÖ Remove unused plugins/themes\n‚úÖ Use strong passwords & 2FA\n‚úÖ Regularly back up your site\n*üì• Get the Plugin\n\nYou can download Recent File Scanner for free here (soon available on the WordPress.org Plugin Directory).\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you‚Äôre managing WordPress sites for clients or even just your own project, this is one of those \"install and forget\" tools that makes your security stack a little stronger.\nFeel free to comment below if you have questions or want to share your own WordPress security tips!",

Let's explore how we can effectively implement this solution.\nUnderstanding Git Hooks\nGit hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as commits and merges.
