It is no longer a new concept, but an inevitable progression towards the future of education. Nowadays, e-learning is not seen just as a temporary solution to global issues like pandemics, but also as a permanent shift that could reshape the very essence of conventional classrooms. So, what might the future of online education look like, and how does this impact traditional classroom settings?\nOnline education has provided the leverage of learning beyond limitations.

          "description": "Over the last few years, I've worked with my team at CodeLines on building real-world products for businesses — from small startups to companies needing automation, marketplaces, or internal tools.\nWe’re based in Armenia 🇦🇲, but our projects run globally — including in Russia, UAE, and Europe. Here's what we've learned building complex systems with Laravel, Vue.js, and React Native.\nWe focus on real, working solutions. Some examples:\nCRM systems with user roles, dashboards, and reporting\nMarketplaces with vendor panels and API integrations\nVPN mobile apps connected to Laravel backend with subscription logic\nProduct labeling platforms integrated with government systems (e.g. Russia's Честный ЗНАК)\nTelegram bots with real-time message processing\nWe usually work with:\nLaravel – for clean backend structure, fast APIs, and secure admin panels\nVue.js – for responsive and flexible UI\nReact Native – to build native apps for both Android & iOS from one codebase\nMongoDB / MySQL – depending on project needs\nNGINX on Ubuntu VPS – for deployments\n💡 Always design scalable DB structures from the beginning.\n🚦 Don’t over-engineer: use Laravel’s ecosystem (queues, jobs, policies) to your advantage.\n🧩 Separate responsibilities: backend stays focused on logic, frontend handles UX/UI.\n⚙️ CI/CD helps a lot — even a simple GitHub Actions setup saves time.\nIf you're working on a project and need a reliable dev team, or just want to share ideas — feel free to connect.\nWe post some of our work at: https://www.codelines.am\n\nYou can reach me directly here or via email.\nThanks for reading.

The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.\nWallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading.
