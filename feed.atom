Spreadsheets work, that’s true. But spreadsheets will no longer be useful if you have an increasing number of assets, which, even worse, need to be updated frequently, daily, hourly, to match the company workflow. At this point, you will need a proper IT asset management tool to handle the tasks.
This is where IT asset management (ITAM) cloud software steps in. In 2025, these cloud-based tools are more powerful than ever, leveraging automation, real-time insights, and accessibility to streamline operations, ensure compliance, and cut costs.
In this article, we’ll compare the top five IT asset management cloud software solutions for 2025. We’ll explore their key features, pricing, and the types of organization…]]></summary>

Let’s not sugarcoat it.
Most developers use Python like it’s a glorified calculator. Maybe some API calls here, some pandas magic there. Cool.
But under the surface—in the depths of GitHub repos, hacker forums, and forgotten mailing lists—there are Python scripts that break the rules of what software is supposed to do.
We're talking about:
Tools built for black-ops automation

Scripts that crawl government datasets for anomalies
Code that repurposes video game engines to train AI agents
Full-stack apps written in under 100 lines

So I woke up and built it anyway.

This is a story of what happens when you throw out UX, logic, and reason — and let your subconscious become the product manager.
The dream app was called "Whispers."
It had no homepage.
It had no navigation.
You could only use it by guessing routes.
Each route gave you a cryptic message like:
“The crow knows when the POST arrives.”
If you POSTed at the right moment, a new page would appear.
If not, you were sent to a 404 void — a blank page with a pulsing red dot.
And the dot?

There’s a war happening right under our noses.
It’s local business owners vs. the digital chaos they never asked for:
$89/month for a site they can’t edit
Agencies charging $2,000 for a WordPress theme from 2015
Contact forms that never send emails
Phone numbers that don’t click on mobile
SEO spam with zero leads
And the worst part?
These are good people.
A few months ago, I brought my car to a mechanic in my area — let’s call him Joe.
While waiting, I overheard him on the phone:

Cross-compiling Go code can be an intimidating task for beginners, especially when you're trying to compile code on one operating system (such as Windows) for another (like Linux). This article will walk you through the steps needed to successfully cross-compile your Go applications from Windows to a Linux environment. You'll learn about the necessary environment flags to set and how to troubleshoot common errors like unsupported GOOS/GOARCH pair.
Why Cross-Compilation is Useful
Cross-compilation is essential for developers who want to deploy their applications on different platforms without needing to switch environments. For instance, building server-side applications that run on Linux while developing on a Windows machine can save time and increase productivity. Go makes th…]]></summary>

Back then, payments were chaos. Especially if you were a business owner juggling transactions across different channels. Card declines, chargebacks, fraud alerts, a payment terminal that needed to be restarted every full moon—it was enough to make you nostalgic for bartering with goats.
And then came AI.
I’ll admit, I was skeptical. “AI in payment processing?” I scoffed. “What’s it going to do—swipe the card for me?”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SafeLine gives you full control over SSL protocols and cipher suites for securing your web applications. Here's how to configure SSL certificates, select supported protocol versions, and customize cipher suites to meet your security needs.
To enable HTTPS access, simply upload your SSL certificate while configuring the corresponding port. SafeLine will handle the rest.

SafeLine supports a wide range of SSL/TLS versions. You can select your desired protocol under the SSL Protocol section. Options include:  
TLSv1

TLSv1.1

TLSv1.2

TLSv1.3

SSLv2

SSLv3




Depending on your security policy or compliance requirements, you may need to specify which encryption algorithms to allow. SafeLine supports custom SSL cipher suites. Below are examples of commonly used configurations:
Nginx (official):

AES128-SHA:AES256-SHA:RC4-SHA:DES-CBC3-SHA:RC4-MD5


Cloudflare (recommended):

[ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256|ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305|ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256|ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305]:ECDHE+AES128:RSA+AES128:ECDHE+AES256:RSA+AES256:ECDHE+3DES:RSA+3DES


Mozilla (modern / TLS 1.3):

TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256


Mozilla (intermediate / TLS 1.2):

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384


Mozilla (legacy TLS 1.0–1.2):

ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256


Cipherli (recommended):

EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM


High-strength configuration:

HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!EXPORT:!CAMELLIA:!DES:!MD5:!PSK:!RC4:!RSA






With these settings, you can ensure your application uses secure and optimized encryption tailored to your specific environment.

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analys…]]></summary>

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDt, is rolling out its tokenized gold digital asset in Thailand with a listing on local cryptocurrency exchange Maxbit.
In a May 13 announcement, Tether said its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt), has been listed on Thai exchange Maxbit.
According to an X announcement by Maxbit, the platform is the first in Thailand to offer a “tokenized gold pair backed by physical gold.”
Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a gold-backed digital asset with a market cap of $802 million, with each XAUt representing ownership of one troy ounce of gold.
Thailand greenlighted stablecoins like Tether USDt in March
Tether Gold’s entrance in the Thai cryptocurrency market follows other notable stablecoin-related regulatory developments in the country.
In March, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission approved US dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across Thailand.

Launched in October 2023, Maxbit is a licensed digital asset exchange based in Thailand, operating under the oversight of the Thai SEC.
According to official SEC records, Thai energy conglomerate PTG Energy is the largest shareholder of Maxbit, with a 35% stake in the firm. Other Maxbit backers include two local private firms, Spearhead Labs and Unit Company, holding 29% and 28.7% in the digital asset business.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.
