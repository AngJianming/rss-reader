These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.
That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.

Beginners in Google Tag Manager
Those who want to create custom events
Those who want to write custom HTML tags
People who have set tag firing priority but it's not working as expected
People who are unsure about the differences between tag firing priority and tag sequencing
This article is written for beginners in Google Tag Manager (GTM) and aims to explain the concept of tag firing priority, which can easily become a trap if misunderstood.
The issue lies in how the Japanese version of the official documentation can be interpreted — it may give the impression that simply setting tag firing priority ensures proper execution order.
However, when reading the official documentation in English, it clearly states:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to introduce SecureFetch.AspNetCore — a lightweight but powerful NuGet package that brings encrypted payloads and obfuscated routes to your ASP.NET Core APIs, without requiring major changes to your controllers.
SecureFetch.AspNetCore is a middleware and attribute-based system for .NET 8+ that allows you to:
🔒 Encrypt request payloads using AES-256.
🕵️‍♂️ Obfuscate route paths and query parameters, hiding sensitive routes from static scanners.
⚙️ Use as middleware — works transparently with your existing endpoints.
🧩 Supports all HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
It's especially useful for teams looking to add a layer of transport-level obfuscation and end-to-end encryption for frontend-to-backend communication — without relying solely on HTTPS.
Client-Side Encryption: Use the secure-fetch-sdk in your frontend to encrypt requests.
Middleware Decryption: The SecureFetch middleware decrypts and proxies incoming requests.
Controller Integration: Add the [SecureFetch] attribute to any controller method you want to secure.
🔗 NuGet Package: SecureFetch.AspNetCore on NuGet

🧰 Frontend SDK: secure-fetch-sdk on NPM

📘 Docs & GitHub: 
securefetch.aspnetcore Docs on GitHub
secure-fetch-sdk Demo on GitHub
Internal tools requiring stealth endpoints
Extra protection for mobile or browser-based apps
High-risk APIs that transmit sensitive data
If you're building modern .NET apps and want an extra layer of security without extra complexity, SecureFetch.AspNetCore is worth a look. ✨
Looking forward!]]></summary>

Both of these models have similar SWE benchmarks, so in this blog, we will mainly focus on Claude Opus 4. ✌️

Now that this new model, Claude Opus 4, is launched, let's see if we have something cool or just another regular AI model. 👀
If you want to jump straight to the conclusion, when Claude Opus 4 is compared against the other two models, Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3, Opus simply dominates and that too by a good margin in coding which you can see for yourself below in the comparison.

If you are looking for a good AI coding assistant, maybe for your editor or in general, Claude Opus 4 is the best option for you (at least for now!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re building or scaling ML projects in 2025, chances are you’ve already bumped into the same question we had:
Both platforms offer powerful tools, automation features, and enterprise-level support. But they also come with key differences, in pricing models, ease of use, ecosystem fit, and even how they handle MLOps workflows.
We made a side-by-side comparison in video form to make the choice easier. Here’s what we cover:
🧠 Ease of use – How beginner-friendly is each platform, and what’s the learning curve like?
🔌 Integrations – How well do they plug into their respective cloud ecosystems (and open-source tools)?
🚀 Performance & scaling – How do they handle large models, training pipelines, and distributed workloads?
💵 Pricing flexibility – Which one gives you more control over costs?
🔐 Security & compliance – Important if you're working in regulated industries like healthcare or finance.
Whether you're a solo dev experimenting with models, or working on production-level ML pipelines with a team, these are the trade-offs worth understanding.
Watch the full comparison here, it's quick, straight to the point, and made for engineers trying to make the best decision for their stack in 2025.
And if you're already using one of these platforms, we’d love to hear from you: What made you choose it, and what’s your experience been like so far?]]></summary>

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…]]></summary>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…]]></summary>

A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300.

Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following a broader altcoin market rally that also saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s “Bull Case” forecast. In a Feb. 11 video, Wood said the price would require BTC to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, largely fueled by increased institutional adoption.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.
