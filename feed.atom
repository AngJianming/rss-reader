Asynchronous programming in JavaScript has revolutionized how developers build applications, allowing for non-blocking execution and a smoother user experience. However, even as there is significant traction with Promises, Async/Await, and the Event Loop, there exists an advanced and often lesser-known technology that pushes the boundaries of asynchronous programming: Fibers. This article dives deep into Fibers, covering their historical and technical context, detailed code examples, edge cases, comparisons with alternative approaches, real-world uses, performance considerations, and advanced debugging techniques.

One solution that is becoming more popular as a way to achieve those goals is Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and more specifically, Front Office BPO services. But what is Front Office BPO, and how does it work? This exhaustive overview will seek to answer that, and much more.
What is Front Office BPO?
Front office BPO is the process of delegating customer-facing services to third party vendors. Front office BPO services include customer service, telemarketing, help desk, sales, market research, technical support, and other customer service-related activities. The front office, in contrast to back office BPO …]]></summary>

What is HTMX and HMPL.js?
HMPL.js is a modern alternative. It uses a fetch API based approach and pure JavaScript to handle requests and responses, as well as templating using {{ … }} placeholders.
And, after reading the article by Anthony Max, I started to see the approach in a different light — especially as a QA Engineer. There are a lot of interesting things that come up, both in terms of technical challenges and quality improvement opportunities, that are worth discussing briefly but deep!

Eight years of steady releases have chipped away at those manual chores and debugging marathons. Today you can spin up a prototype on par with well-known SaaS products—often in a single weekend—using Amplify alone.

This post walks through that journey, highlighting what each release simplified and which kinds of products suddenly became feasible. Use it as a retrospective or as a compass for planning your own adoption.

Let me take you on a rollercoaster ride through my Python journey. Buckle up—it’s about to get snekky.

setState Feels Delayed in React (And What You Can Do About It)


Hey everyone! If you’ve just started coding in React—creating components and managing state—I’m pretty sure you’ve run into this common issue:
You update the state using setState, and in the very next line, you're expecting the new value, right?

const [count, setCount] = useState(1);

const handleCount = () => {
  setCount(prev => prev + 1);
  console.log(count); // This won't log what you're expecting! It will still log the old value which is 1
};

Let’s explore why this happens and how you can deal with it effectively.
React is More Optimized Than You Might Think


React is designed with performance in mind. Every time a state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect that new changed value in the UI. It was ve…]]></summary>
