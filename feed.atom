        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey developers 👋,
Just another casual day discussing code with my colleagues when one of them brought up something surprisingly interesting — the good old includes() method in JavaScript arrays. Most of us use it regularly, but have you ever paused and asked:
"What really happens inside includes()?"
Let’s explore how it works, including edge cases and the comparison logic behind it.
Array.prototype.includes()?


The includes() method determines whether an array contains a specified element. It returns a boolean: true if the element is found, false otherwise.
array.includes(searchElement)
array.includes(searchElement, fromIndex)

searchElement: The value to search for.
fromIndex (optional): The position in the array at which to start the search. Defaults to 0.

Implement OAuth 2.0, MFA, RBAC, and encryption standards by default.
Use accessible design systems and keep onboarding friction low.
REST APIs and event-driven microservices help connect ERPs, CRMs, and BI tools.
Implement local caching and conflict resolution with automatic sync.
Use Firebase, WebSockets, or Kafka-based pipelines for live dashboards.
RBAC at feature and data levels keeps access streamlined and secure.
Leverage Flutter, React Native, or Kotlin Multiplatform for cross-platform builds.
Use FCM or APNs with context-aware notification logic.
Elasticsearch, Algolia, or custom tokenized queries for speed.
Auto-scale on AWS, GCP, or Azure with containerized deployment.

That’s not just a gimmick. It’s your next big challenge.
Voice search is no longer a futuristic trend — it’s here, and it’s changing how people search, how search engines respond, and how websites should be built.
If your website isn't optimized for voice, you’re potentially missing out on 50% of your traffic.
Let’s break it down and get your site ready for voice — one step at a time. 💡

By 2025, it’s expected that over 60% of all searches will be voice-based.
People use voice search differently — they’re more conversational, longer, and intent-focused.
Mobile-first indexing and smart speakers (like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant) are accelerating this shift.
Here’s what voice queries sound like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too often, developers are handed features and deadlines they had no say in then expected to "just build it." But here's the truth: involving devs early, during project scoping, doesn’t slow things down. It prevents chaos later.
As a Digital Project Manager, I’ve seen how dev input at the earlyplanning stage saves time and avoid delays and mistakes:
Exposes assumptions before they become blockers
Surfaces smarter, simpler technical solutions
Helps avoid overpromising and underestimating
Builds shared ownership between product and engineering
I try to create space for developers in sprint planning, roadmap reviews, and even at early stage ideation when possible. Their insights on feasibility and edge cases save so much time and frustration down the line.
If you're a developer do you feel sometime looped into scoping discussions, or just pulled in when the "fun" starts?
