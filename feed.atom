I know, it's been a while.  For anyone wondering if I'd given up the blogging habit, I haven't.  I just forgot how to read for a bit.
Luckily, however, I have a 4-year-old that loves Dr Seuss, so that's gotten me back on track and no worse for the wear, except for my new penchant to follow people around like an absolute maniac, trying to get them to eat eggs and ham.
Instead of returning to form with one of the many productive tutorials I have in mind, today I rant.  But I think it will be productive and even help some of you reading.

Hey everyone,
What’s in it:
Detailed Tutorials & config template to eploy backend to Vercel and frontend to Cloudflare (both have free tiers)
Supabase for database and auth (also free tier)
Generate frontend client based on backend API
Dashboard with metrics and analytics
User management and role-based access control
Sign up / sign in with OAuth
Task management with full CRUD
Pre-configured dev setup with Docker and hot reload
Login & Signup

Task management

User management

it’s meant to be used as a quick project starter for app developed by a single person, It followed solid backend/frontend practices, used modern tools (React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, OpenAPI, etc.), and tried to keep the architecture clean and easy to extend.
If you’re looking to learn how to actually build and deploy a real app with no cost, this could help. Whether you’re making a SaaS, a side project, or just want to understand the fullstack flow better, I hope this saves you some time.
Still actively improving it, so any feedback is appreciated.
Frontend is based on this great project called shadcn-admin (https://github.com/satnaing/shadcn-admin)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this article, we will review ensureArray function in Tsup source code.
We will look at:
ensureArray function definition.


Where is ensureArray function invoked?




You will find the below code in cli-main.ts in Tsup source code at line 7
function ensureArray(input: string): string[] {
  return Array.isArray(input) ? input : input.split(',')
}

This function returns input as an array of strings. For that, it first checks if the input is an array using Array.isArray method. If that is true, then the input is returned since it is an array otherwise the input is split based on comma.
Overall, ensureArray is used in four places in cli-main.ts.

At line 112, you will find this below code
const format = ensureArray(flags.format) as Format[]
options.format = format

you will find this below code, at line 116
if (flags.external) {
  const external = ensureArray(flags.external)
  options.external = external
}

you will find this below code, at line 137
if (flags.inject) {
  const inject = ensureArray(flags.inject)
  options.inject = inject
}

you will find this below code at line 144
if (flags.loader) {
  const loader = ensureArray(flags.loader)
  options.loader = loader.reduce((result, item) => {
    const parts = item.split('=')
    return {
      ...result,
      [parts[0]]: parts[1],
    }
  }, {})
}

In the world of web development, performance is king. Fast-loading applications keep users happy, reduce server load, and improve overall user experience. One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through intelligent caching. When a client requests data that hasn't changed since their last request, wouldn't it be great if we could just tell them "you already have this"? That's exactly what the HTTP 304 Not Modified status code is for.
However, implementing 304 Not Modified effectively can be tricky, especially when in the real world data lives in a database. How do you efficiently determine if the data has truly changed without re-fetching and re-processing everything? This is where Delta comes in. As SimonCropp says

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Dev Community! 👋
I’m Manognya Lokesh Reddy, and I love building practical AI tools that solve real-world problems. Today, I want to share a project that’s especially close to me—DocuDetective.AI, an AI-powered chatbot I built that lets users interact with PDF documents using natural language.
If you’ve ever struggled to find specific info in a 100+ page document, you’ll love this.
🤔 The Problem
You’re looking for specific information fast.
The document is in a language you don’t understand.
You want a summary instead of reading the whole thing.
DocuDetective.AI was built to solve all of this.
🧠 Project Goals
Ask questions like “What is the main conclusion?” or “Translate this section.”
Support vernacular language translation.
Use AI to chat with the document in real-time.
🛠️ Tech Stack
LangChain – for chaining LLMs with document loaders and memory
Chroma DB – for vector embeddings and document retrieval
OpenAI GPT models – for natural language understanding
Streamlit (optional) – for a user-friendly interface
⚙️ How It Works
Vector Storage
Query Handling
Response Generation
📊 Results & Impact
💬 Increased user engagement by 35% through interactive Q&A instead of static search.
🌍 Helped bridge language gaps for users working with multilingual documents.
💡 What I Learned
Preprocessing and chunking documents is a balancing act. Too much or too little = bad results.
Users prefer conversation over command lines—good UX really matters.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm Omar, and this time I wanted to bring you some good news about the latest release of LightningChart JS Trader 3.1.
LightningChart JS Trader is a high-precision chart suite for creating next-gen financial & trading applications.
In this release, we focused on adding quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. Here are some of the changes:
Starting with version 3.1, LightningChart JS Trader is available for download from the public NPM registry. Previously, it was distributed via separate files sent by email. 
A valid license key (trial or purchased) is still required to use the library. Older versions will not be published on NPM. With this change, we are simplifying both updates and trial downloads.
You can now set the chart to use a transparent background, making it easier to match the application’s background. Here is an example of a chart with a transparent background. The colors come from the underlying div-elements:

The Mountain chart type can now be colored using a gradient fill. The coloring is based on the current line color and the enableMountainGradient() method can be used to switch the gradient on and off.

Time range methods
HTML text rendering
Menu options
Clear everything method
Problem with the space bar not closing menus anymore when typing in the input fields
The menus work better now when the chart height is small
Color pickers now appear next to the color button instead of the top-left corner.
However, note that Firefox browser has still some issues with this. Furthermore, the default color in the color pickers now matches the current color in all cases.
We also improved the accuracy of the data cursor The Zoomband chart height is now based on the main chart’s height, allowing it to scale better.
Access the latest version with a 30-day free trial. Or read the official release note.

From third-party software updates to IoT devices embedded in logistics processes, each integration creates a potential entry point. That’s why digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) is now central to securing the modern supply chain.
Unlike direct attacks on enterprises, supply chain threats often involve indirect compromise—infecting a trusted vendor, product, or update that gets absorbed into the target’s environment. Famous examples include the SolarWinds and Kaseya incidents, where attackers leveraged trusted channels to gain internal access to thousands of systems worldwide.

React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer Jordan Walke.
React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.
React is a tool for building UI components.
How does React Work?
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!
React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.
You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.
What You Should Already Know
HTML
React.JS History
Initial release to the Public (version 0.3.0) was in July 2013.
React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.
Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.
. Virtual DOM
Creates a lightweight copy of the DOM (Virtual DOM).
Component-Based Architecture
React follows a component-based approach, where the UI is broken down into reusable components. These components:
Can be functional or class-based.
JSX (JavaScript XML)
React usesJSX, a syntax extension that allows developers to write HTML inside JavaScript. JSX makes the code:
More readable and expressive.
One-Way Data Binding


State Management


React Hooks



useState: for managing local state.
React Router
React provides React Router for managing navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). It enables dynamic routing without requiring full-page reloads.]]></summary>
