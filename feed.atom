If you’re building for a client who keeps shifting the goalpost, here’s some honest advice:
Avoid SQL until the spec is stable.
Every schema change = manual migration
Every migration = rollback risk
Every miscommunication = broken relations or corrupted data
It’s like building a skyscraper with a blueprint drawn in crayon.
No migrations


Nested data, no problem


Speed over structure


Schema-less = stress-less







  
  
  ⚖️ But if you have to use SQL…


Some teams/projects require relational DBs. Here are tools that make the pain tolerable:
Prisma Type-safe, declarative schema, powerful migration engine
Knex.js + Objection.js Mature and battle-tested in Node environments
Atlas by Ariga Clean migration workflows, good for CI/CD
Supabase 🔥 Firebase-like developer experience on top of PostgreSQL
Instant APIs
Auth + storage included
Web UI for managing schema/migrations
Great for teams that need SQL but want NoSQL-level velocity
Even though it’s SQL under the hood, Supabase makes schema changes easier to manage. You can:
View and edit tables in the dashboard
Auto-generate APIs
Roll back or push migrations with Git workflows
It's a great compromise if your project is too relational for Firestore but still in flux.
If the client says “we’re still figuring it out,” avoid SQL unless you enjoy stress.
✅ Use Firestore when things are unstable or MVP
✅ Use Supabase if you need SQL but want NoSQL flexibility
✅ Use proper migration tools (Prisma, Knex, Atlas) if you're stuck with raw SQL
Choose tools that match the reality of the project, not what sounds good on paper.]]></summary>

Implementing syntax highlighting for your QScintilla-based IDE using Tree Sitter can be both rewarding and challenging. If you're facing issues with color mismatching and incomplete highlight recognition after editing text, you're not alone. This tutorial will walk you through the implementation of a custom lexer that leverages the powerful parsing capabilities of Tree Sitter, ensuring accurate and efficient syntax highlighting for Python code in your application.
Why Syntax Highlighting Issues Occur
Syntax highlighting problems often stem from the way the text is parsed and how styling is applied afterward. When using Tree Sitter, each node in the abstract syntax tree (AST) corresponds to a specific part of your code, like keywords, functions, or comments. However, if the hig…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In distributed systems, one of the most common and tricky challenges is ensuring synchronized access to shared resources across multiple server instances.
For example, when a user initiates a money transfer, updates a shared task list, or interacts with a counter, the request may hit any instance in your cluster. Unless synchronized properly, this can result in race conditions, inconsistent state, or data corruption.
Developers typically reach for one of two well-known approaches:
Using pessimistic locking (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) or JPA's @Lock(PESSIMISTIC_WRITE):
Simple and widely supported

Ties up database connections

Increases contention and slows down unrelated queries
Using a distributed lock pattern (e.g., Redlock via Redisson):
Offloads lock state from the DB

Just days after incorporation, I closed a $70,000 contract. No funding. No connections. No fancy pitch decks. Just proof of work, relentless execution, and solving real problems fast.
Now I’m channeling that momentum into building something much bigger.
NousCore My Legacy Project


I won’t spill everything. There are too many eyes and too many people trying to ride waves they didn’t earn.
But here’s what I can share:
• It’s an AI-native platform that runs on the edge, not in the cloud
Think of it as a personal AI system that works for you and not for advertisers, not for surveillance, and not for data farms.
I’m tired of bloated software and overengineered cloud stacks that leak data and burn budgets. I want to create something powerful, self-contained, and private. Something that lasts.
This isn’t just a product. It’s a statement.
I’ll be documenting parts of my journey (without giving away the sauce). From technical breakdowns to startup realities.
If you're into AI, systems design, or just want to build things that matter, follow along.

If you're experiencing issues with your sidebar not toggling back on small screens despite your JavaScript appearing to work, you’re not alone. Many developers encounter problems where certain UI elements behave differently based on screen size. This article will explore why the sidebar might disappear on small screens and how to fix it effectively.
Understanding CSS and JavaScript Interactions
The problem often lies not just within your JavaScript code but also in your CSS styles. The appearance and disappearance of UI elements can be heavily influenced by CSS rules associated with different screen sizes (responsive design). In your case, the sidebar might be successfully receiving the 'active' class, but the corresponding CSS might hide it on smaller screens.

Why Use Axum and Tonic Together?
Combining Axum (a web framework) and Tonic (a gRPC framework) in one server is advantageous for microservices architecture. You can efficiently handle both HTTP 1.1 requests and gRPC requests without needing to manage multiple ports.

A little context: during my last CS semester, I was working on a project at UFCG in partnership with Nubank, which was honestly really great. But on my final months there a little alarm went off in my head:
“I’m graduating this semester, man—I gotta land a job ASAP.”
I started by asking a friend who works at Google for her CV (I thought that if she landed a job at GOOGLE with that CV format, it must be a great one, idk, as if that was the decisive factor haha). Then I just started applying to every job opening I could find, even ones I didn’t re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Há dois anos, comecei a criar um jogo baseado nos conhecimentos que adquiri na faculdade. Quando finalizei a primeira versão, fiquei satisfeito o suficiente para lançá-lo e deixá-lo de lado.
Recentemente, minha namorada jogou e gostou da ideia — a ponto de querer refazer algumas pixel arts. Aproveitei a empolgação e pensei: “por que não adicionar algumas coisas novas também?”
Voltei ao projeto e, para minha surpresa, a arquitetura ainda estava tão bem estruturada que em dois dias já entendi novamente como tudo funcionava. Reimplementei funcionalidades sem “explodir” nada e com facilidade. Resultado? Temos um beta renovado pronto para testes!
O que eu fizemos
2 - Adicionei um sistema de buffs: quando algo acontece, um efeito é disparado.
3 - Comecei a implementar compatibilidade com controle.
4 - Adicionei novas fases.
5 - Um novo boss foi criado (ainda não implementado no jogo).
Criar um jogo do zero é difícil — mas retomar um projeto de dois anos atrás pode ser ainda mais desafiador. Por competência (e não sorte), o jogo estava tão bem estruturado que pude incluir novas mecânicas com facilidade.
Outro aprendizado valioso foi sobre o uso do GitHub, que me ajudou muito tanto no versionamento quanto no armazenamento do projeto. E claro, um detalhe divertido: também usei IA para me ajudar em algumas partes — o que foi uma experiência bem curiosa e produtiva.
O que vamos fazer
Organizar as fases de forma mais dinâmica
Finalizar a compatibilidade com controle
Adicionar luzes e sombras para dar mais vida ao cenário
Quer testar o jogo?

Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a previous ruling from the United Kingdom Competition Appeal Tribunal, throwing out the claims of undue damage from the delisting, should be examined again, according to legal outlet Law360.

According to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million.
El Salvador's Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases.

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the "loss of chance" claim made against Binance for delisting the token, should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages, in the original case.

"Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell," the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. "Strategy's holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders," Ju continued.
Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, is an outspoken Bitcoin advocate who evangelizes the scarce digital currency to potential investors and has inspired many other companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury plan.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…]]></summary>

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.

The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong-based fintech firm RedotPay has reportedly launched its cryptocurrency-enabled payment cards in South Korea, positioning itself as a potential disruptor in a market dominated by traditional credit card firms and mobile payment services.
The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.
In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

“Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.
