One of the Terraform’s biggest strengths lies in its modular architecture, which allows teams to use and share best practices through reusable modules.
Another reason to love Terraform? The frequent updates to HCL that often make me go “wooh”! This post dives into one such update — still in beta but offering a much cleaner approach to multi-region deployments.
Managing AWS resources across multiple regions has traditionally required separate provider configurations for each of the regions. If you’ve ever needed to deploy something like an SNS topic in multiple regions, you probably kno…]]></summary>

When working with Solana, understanding how accounts function is absolutely critical. Unlike traditional databases or even other blockchains, Solana structures nearly everything through its unique Account Model. This article will walk you through the concept of Solana accounts, what they store, how they operate, and why they are fundamental to everything built on the platform.
On Solana, everything is an account. Literally. Whether it's a user’s wallet, a smart contract, a token mint, or program data — all are stored in accounts. Think of Solana as a massive public key-value store where each key is a unique address (public key), and the value is …]]></summary>

When building complex software systems, it can be tempting to jump straight into coding without a clear understanding of the problem domain. This often leads to brittle, hard-to-maintain codebases that fail to meet the needs of the business. Enter Domain-Driven Design (DDD)—a methodology that emphasizes collaboration between technical and business stakeholders to design software that truly reflects the core business domain.
In this blog post, we’ll explore how to implement Domain-Driven Design principles in C# using Entity Framework (EF). We’ll cover key concepts like aggregates, repositories, value objects, and domain services, complete with practical code examples.

A traget element intersects either the device's viewport or a specified element. That specified element is called the root element or root for the purposes of the Intersection Observer API.


The first time the observer is initially asked to watch a target element.



Typically, you'll want to watch for intersection changes with regard to the target element's closest scrollable ancestor, or, if the target element is not a descendant of a scrollable element, the device's viewport.
The API works the same way, in all cases, whether you're using the viewport or some other element as the root.

For this challenge, I decided to showcase my personal portfolio – a celebration of my skills, growth, and passion as a frontend developer. This project reflects both my technical abilities and design sensibility, presented in a minimalist and professional way.
🔗 Live Portfolio: rohit.bhatu.in
Code: Not open-sourced yet, but feel free to explore the site and connect for collaborations!
Building this portfolio was a rewarding process that pushed me to refine my UI/UX decisions and strengthen my frontend skills. I used:
React & Next.js for component-driven structure and performance
Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
Framer Motion for smooth UI interactions
What I’m most proud of is keeping the design clean, functional, and reflective of who I am as a developer. Through this challenge, I also explored fine-tuning layout responsiveness and animation transitions.
Looking forward to improving it further by integrating a blog section and some light/dark mode enhancements!
Thanks for checking it out! Feedback is always welcome 😊.]]></summary>

It helps in preventing memory leaks and optimizing application performance. Java handles garbage collection through the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which tracks objects no longer referenced by any part of the program. Although it is automatic, developers can suggest garbage collection by calling System.gc(), but it is not guaranteed to execute immediately. Efficient memory management through garbage collection ensures smooth and stable Java applications.]]></summary>

Let's be honest, 'expense tracking' often sounds like a synonym for 'tedious,' 'boring,' and 'something I'll definitely start next month.' We all know we should keep an eye on our spending, especially with the convenience of online shopping, and how carried away we can get with it. But the reality is, saving digital receipts, painstakingly entering data into a spreadsheet or app, and trying to remember what category 'that random Amazon purchase' falls into is enough to make anyone give up. With the hustle of our everyday lives, tracking online orders is just not something we can prioritise, but it is something we should prioritise because those purchases add up and you can go overboard so easily.
