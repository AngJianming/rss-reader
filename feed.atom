If we were granted a pizza party by the teacher, it was for something phenomenal that we had achieved... 100% participation in some special activity, or excellence on a particular  test... in some more rowdy classes, it was just because everyone behaved appropriately for the same couple of days in a week 🤣!!!

Back at the beginning of my career, I experienced a parallel - the catered lunch.  I was on a team with a pretty specific focus on app support; we had a workload of tickets and that was how we received all of our work.  It was a pretty overwhelming workload - a half-dozen of us had to manage a hundred tickets per day, triaging anything from automated system monitor alerts all the way to diagn…]]></summary>

It’s powerful and useful in corporate settings, but if you're a personal user and didn’t set it up, it could be a serious security red flag.
In this guide, you'll learn:
What Remote Management is

However, ownership has declined, falling to 29% in 2024 from 40% in 2023, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21.
The survey, conducted in February with 1,500 participants, revealed that men remain more active in crypto investing than women, 35% compared to 24%.
Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

As developers in 2025, we often find ourselves working on projects that demand a mix of programming languages, frameworks, and databases – a practice known as polyglot programming. One project might be a robust PHP backend with MySQL, another a snappy Node.js microservice hitting MongoDB, and perhaps a Python script for data analysis talking to PostgreSQL. This diversity is exciting, allowing us to pick the best tool for each job.

It actually happened.
Today, we’re celebrating one of the most legendary stories in Bitcoin history a story that reminds us how far we’ve come, how wild the ride has been, and why this quirky industry continues to capture imaginations.
Let’s break it down storytime style.
🕰️ Flashback to May 22, 2010
Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the BitcoinTalk forum:
“I'll pay 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.”
Yes, that’s right. 10,000 BTC.
Soon after, someone delivered two Papa John’s pizzas to his doorstep, and history was made. At the time, those coins were worth around $41.

However, these tools have one major limitation: building anything beyond a simple landing page usually requires a robust backend. You might suggest integrating Supabase, but it's primarily a database abstraction layer around PostgreSQL, not a standalone backend. Supabase often falls short when scaling complex, high-performance products.
If you're creating a service that needs high scalability, robust security, or something beyond web (like mobile apps, desktop apps, or performance-critical solutions), you need a proper backend.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with domain-specific or real-time information. By coupling an LLM with a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, RAG significantly mitigates issues like hallucination (generating factually incorrect information) and the inability to access current or proprietary data. This approach grounds LLM responses in verifiable sources, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.
Despite its advantages, building effective RAG applications presents its own set of challenges. These include ensuring the retrieved information is highly relevant to the user's query, guaranteeing the LLM's generated response faithfully adheres to the retrieved context, and m…]]></summary>

High-frequency trading refers to algorithm-driven trading strategies that execute a large volume of transactions in milliseconds. These systems exploit minor price discrepancies across exchanges or within a single order book to generate profit.

When Replyke v5 launched a couple of days ago, it shipped under a single AGPL‑3.0 license - for both the server and the client packages. A day later, this question came in through Discord.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…]]></summary>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens.

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.
