Its an influential work in deep learning and NLP that introduced the Transformer architecture, now the foundation for models like GPT, BERT, and T5. (T in all these names stands for transformer.) 
This paper basically created modern AI as we know. Every major model as of 2025 is built off this idea. Without this paper, your AI memes, GPT side projects, AI-generated rap battles and that billion dollor GenAI startup idea wouldn't exist. So if you get this paper, you get modern AI.

In total, from starting the course to finally getting through the installation chapter, it took me 8 hours. 😩
I had so many questions and got super confused during the installation process. I kept googling things, checking images, and asking ChatGPT — and slowly it started to make more sense. (Not gonna lie, Google Images helped more than anything else 😂).

Initially, I tried installing **Ubuntu **through PowerShell, but it didn’t go well. Then I tried installing it from the Microsoft Store, but that version wasn’t working either. Strangely, the "incomplete" installation from PowerShell started working out of nowhere. Not sure what really happened, but it seems to be working fine now. 👍
I haven’t moved on from the chapter yet — just making sure Ubuntu is installed correctly and running well. I asked ChatGPT how to check that, and so far, all the tests are coming back fine.
I’ve always wanted to try Linux, but I had this fear that my old and slow PC might crash or something. Now, I feel like I’m slowly convincing myself to properly learn and use Linux. ✌

Perception is the mental process of selecting, organizing, and interpreting sensory information to make sense of the world around us.  
  
Subjective: Two people can see the same event yet interpret it differently.


Active: We constantly filter and focus on stimuli that matter to us.


Dynamic: Past experiences, moods, and goals shape our perceptions in real time.



Why It Matters  
Guides how we respond to colleagues and tasks.

Shapes communication—misperceptions can lead to conflict.

Influences motivation—people act on how they perceive rewards and risks.



  
Perception is a mix of three categories of factors:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Setting up continuous deployment for your Django application can save you hours of manual server updates. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to automate deployment using GitHub Actions, SSH, and Systemd.
We’ll use a real-world example: a Django backend API hosted on a subdomain (api.example.com), deployed to a remote Ubuntu server.
Before you begin, ensure you have:
A Django project hosted on GitHub.
A remote server (Ubuntu) with:
Python & pip
virtualenv
Gunicorn
Nginx configured for your app
SSH access to the server



Gunicorn configured as a systemd service



GitHub repository secrets setup

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To use SSH for CI/CD in GitHub Actions, you need to generate an SSH key pair and add:
The private key to your GitHub repo secrets.
The public key to your server’s authorized keys.
Here’s how to do it:
Run this in your terminal (Linux/macOS/git bash/WSL):
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-deploy"

If your system doesn’t support ed25519, you can use:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "github-deploy"

When prompted:
Enter file name: You can name it something like ~/.ssh/github_cicd


Passphrase: Leave empty (press Enter) for automation
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/github_cicd.pub deployuser@your.server.ip

Replace deployuser with the actual username on your server and your.server.ip with your server IP or domain.
If ssh-copy-id isn't available, do this manually:
cat ~/.ssh/github_cicd.pub

Copy the output and add it to:
~/.ssh/authorized_keys

on your server.
Open your private key:




cat ~/.ssh/github_cicd

Copy the entire content (including -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- and -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----).


Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.


Name: SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
(paste the private key)







  
  
  ✅ 4. Use the Key in GitHub Actions


Your GitHub Actions file is already using this with:
- name: Set up SSH
  uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.7.0
  with:
    ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}

That’s it — GitHub will now be able to SSH into your server during deployment.]]></summary>

MarketMail – a crowdsourced produce‑price exchange for Uganda & East Africa that runs entirely by e‑mail.

Farmers or enumerators send a simple price list to prices@your-domain.com; Postmark’s inbound webhook feeds the data into a Node.js API, which:
Parses and validates the e‑mail (body or CSV/XLSX attachment).

Normalises units/currency and stores records in MongoDB.

Calculates daily deltas and 7‑day averages.

Sends the sender an automated market‑trend report.

Publishes an open JSON API and a React dashboard so anyone can view live prices.
The flow works from any basic e‑mail client, so even users on feature phones with intermittent data can contribute and benefit.
Live URL: https://marketmail.vercel.app

Test: e‑mail the sample below to send@marketmail.canktech.com.
Country: Uganda
Market: Nakasero
Date: 2025‑05‑28
Maize (kg): 1850
Beans (kg): 2950
Tomatoes (crate): 9800

You’ll receive a reply within ~10 s containing a cleaned table and a mini market report. The dashboard at https://marketmail.vercel.app/dashboard?market=Nakasero will update automatically.
https://github.com/Cank256/market-mail  (MIT licence)
Email layer: Postmark inbound/outbound (signature verification, bounce hooks).


Backend: Node.js 20, Express, TypeScript, Zod validation.


Parsing: RegEx + optional OpenAI for fuzzy headers; papaparse / xlsx for attachments.


Data: MongoDB Atlas (MarketPrice schema, aggregation pipelines).


Front‑end: React 18 + Vite, Recharts, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui.


CI/CD: GitHub Actions → Vercel.


Accessibility: Plain‑text fallbacks, semantic HTML, dashboard passes WCAG 2.1 AA.


Dev‑experience: Detailed PROJECT.md, Jest tests cover parser & API routes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a submission for the Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators.
I made https://dearme.email/. It's a service that let's you send an email to yourself, which you receive after 30 days. 
What could you use this for? You can send yourself reminders, check in on your goals, and maybe benefit from the perspective of listening to your past self. In an age where bots are everywhere, it's nice to be able to have a human connection with yourself. Not to mention the fact that you can actually do a bit of time travelling, which is awesome. 
You can send an email to hello@dearme.email and it will be sent back to you in 30 days. We encrypt the email on our end, decrypt it when it's time to send it back and then we delete the message from our systems. We do demand that you varify your email. If you don't do that within 30 days we delete the message.
It's a fairly basic Python/postgres setup with Flask. Postmark really takes care of most of the hard bits here. There's a webhook and a cronjob too, but nothing too fancy. 
I might add payments later to help cover the postgres costs, which I'll probably build with lemonsqueezy. But assuming there's not a huge demand for this app overnight I should be fine. Postmark has reasonable pricing and they also do some spam detection (which is a concern of mine given that anyone can email).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I learn more about cloud computing and AWS, I came across EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – a service that enables me run virtual servers in the cloud. These instances gave me full control over how to set them up and access them.
To connect to an EC2 instance securely, I used SSH (Secure Shell). Since I’m on a Windows machine I used a free tool called PuTTY, which helps me manage my instances both safely and conveniently.
SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure way to connect to a remote device like a server. Instead of typing in a password I used a key pair – a public key stored on the server and a private key saved safely on my computer.
To connect to AWS instance I followed below steps using PuTTY on Windows.
What I Used:
A running EC2 instance on AWS
A .ppt key pair that I downloaded when launching the instance
PuTTY installed on my PC.
I opened PuTTY.
In the Host Name field, I entered the public IP of my EC2 instance (from the AWS console).
Under Connection → SSH → Auth, I browsed and selected my .ppk file.
I clicked Open to start the session.
When prompted for a username, I used ec2-user for Amazon Linux
PuTTY is lightweight and easy to use. It helps me:
Save sessions for quick connections
Use terminal commands like I would on a Linux server
Learning how to connect to AWS EC2 instances using SSH and PuTTY has been a valuable experience. It helped me understand the basics of secure server management and gives me hands-on practice in cloud computing.]]></summary>

Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:

TLDR: A designers brain is wired differently, and as a logical thinker you will never be able to comprehend their deep state of being.
As a developer, it's not necessary to adapt this state. After all - designers and developers are completely different roles. But it sure helps if you know at least some basics. So here are 5 tips that I use to avoid building crappy apps and make something usable.

I recently built a tool called tilegen, which is essentially a tile generator that slices up a high-res image into thousands of tiles across multiple zoom levels, just like Google Maps does (well, almost). This post is a deep dive into what tilegen is, how it works, the quirks I ran into, and how mapping giants like Google do it too.
At its core, tilegen takes a massive image (like a satellite photo, map scan, game world, or giant illustration), and cuts it into 256×256 PNG tiles across zoom levels. These tiles can then be loaded on demand by a viewer, allowing users to pan and zoom without downloading gigabytes of image data up front.

According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.
