I'm a full-stack developer and have been fascinated by the progress in LLMs and image generation for the last year and a half. After seeing the AI headshot market explode, I noticed a common complaint: you'd pay for 100 images just to get a handful of good ones.
I knew I could do better by focusing on model quality and prompting. So, I challenged myself to build and launch a high-quality alternative from scratch in just two weeks.
Today, I’m excited to share that I launched Smart Headshots AI.
Frontend: Next.js (love the performance)
Backend: Supabase for everything - auth, database, storage
UI: Kept it dead simple internally, went all-out on the landing page using shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
Payments: Switched to Dodo Payments (MOR) after hearing too many Stripe horror stories

Ever struggled to explain a concept because creating diagrams eats up your time? Whether it’s for a presentation, paper, or documentation, visuals beat plain text—but they take forever.
Fun fact: I even made the cover image for this post using it😁.
Meet Napkin AI:


Paste your bullet points, click the spark button, and instantly get a polished figure—with icons, spacing, and typography handled. No design skills or templates needed.d)
Let me show you exactly how this works with a real example:

I paste this text into Napkin AI, click the blue spark button, and BOOM! 

It generates this beautiful comparison table showing "Compiler vs. Transpiler" with:
Color-coded sections
Professional icons
Clean typography
Perfect spacing
Ready-to-use design

You can export your creations as:
PNG - Perfect for documentation and README files
SVG - Scalable for web and presentations


PowerPoint slide - Edit directly and copy-paste into your deck
Boom! Your figure is done. ✨
Pro tip:✌ The more specific your text, the better the output. Instead of writing "database stores data," write "PostgreSQL database stores user profiles with foreign key relationships to sessions table."
Napkin AI understands technical jargon - use it to your advantage!
Go to app.napkin.ai

Paste any technical text you have
Click the blue spark button
Watch the magic happen
The free plan is surprisingly generous for everyone getting started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
Like many of you, I often work on several microservices at once. I found myself needing a straightforward way to centralize my application logs without the overhead of setting up a full ELK/EFK stack or paying for a third-party service, especially for smaller projects or internal tools.
So, I decided to build my own simple, two-part solution and I've just open-sourced it. I'm sharing it today in the hope that it might be useful to others and to get some feedback from this amazing community.
The solution consists of two separate projects:
log-sense-logback-appender
This is a custom Logback appender packaged as a Spring Boot starter. The idea is to make integration dead simple.
What it does: It automatically hooks into your logging system and sends log events as structured JSON (including MDC properties and stack traces) to an HTTP endpoint.
https://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense-logback-appender
Here’s how easy the configuration is in any service you want to monitor:
Properties
logsense.appender.enabled=true
http://localhost:8080/api/logs
logsense-server
This is the other half of the duo. It’s a simple Spring Boot application that acts as the collector.
What it does: It runs a lightweight server with a single REST endpoint (/api/logs) that listens for the JSON payloads sent by the appender.
https://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense
I'd love your feedback!
What do you think of this approach for simple, centralized logging?
Are there any obvious pitfalls or security concerns I might have overlooked?
What features would you consider essential for a V2? (e.g., batching log sends, authentication, a simple query UI?)
Thanks for taking the time to check it out!]]></summary>

In Perl, file handles are used to interact with files. You can open a file for reading, writing, or appending. There are multiple ways to open a file, but the most common method is using the open keyword. The open keyword takes three arguments: a file handle, a mode, and the filename. The mode specifies how you want to interact with the file. There are multiple modes available you can use the following table as a reference to common file modes in Perl:

In the last year, the AI landscape has rapidly evolved. We've moved beyond static prompt engineering into building AI agents, autonomous systems capable of reasoning, taking actions, using tools, and adapting to complex goals. These agents represent a major leap from traditional AI applications, requiring not just LLMs but orchestration, memory, and structured workflows.
Most of this innovation has happened in the Python ecosystem, with tools like LangChain, AutoGen, and Semantic Kernel leading the way. But as JavaScript and TypeScript continue to dominate full-stack development, there’s a growing need for agent frameworks built natively for JS, without forcing developers to switch stacks or work around language mismatches.
