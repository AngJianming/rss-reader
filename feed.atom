Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

1. Optional Chaining (?.)
const userName = user?.profile?.name ?? "Guest";

2. Destructuring for Cleaner Code
const { name, age } = person;
const [first, second] = colors;


3. Array.some() and Array.every()
items.some(item => item.stock > 0);  
items.every(item => item.stock > 0);


4. Spread & Rest Operators
const newArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];  
function sum(...nums) { return nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); }


5. Short-Circuit Evaluation
&& and || to simplify conditional logic:
isLoggedIn && showDashboard();  
const user = input || "Anonymous";


These tricks aren't advanced — just practical. Once I started using them, my code became much cleaner and easier to understand. If you're learning JavaScript, give these a try!

YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language designed for configuration and data interchange. Unlike XML or JSON, YAML uses minimal syntax and indentation (spaces) to represent structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.
Developers encounter YAML all the time: it’s the backbone of many DevOps tools (Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions workflows, etc.). 
For instance, GitHub Actions workflows are defined in YAML files (in .github/workflows/), since “YAML is a markup language that’s commonly used for configuration files”. Because of its ubiquity in modern tooling and its focus on readability, understanding YAML is invaluable for developers.

In modern React development, managing state predictably is key to building maintainable, scalable applications. While useState handles simple state needs, useReducer shines when your component’s state logic becomes more complex or when the next state depends on the previous one.
In this article, we'll break down the useReducer hook in depth and show how it enables clear, scalable, and testable state transitions. We’ll also build a mathematical counter using reducer patterns, covering advanced JavaScript concepts like the spread operator, custom actions, and strict typing with TypeScript.

Bitcoin made a new all-time high, but the bulls will have to sustain the higher levels for the momentum to pick up.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to maintain its positive momentum and surge above $200,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a new all-time high on May 21 on easing macroeconomic fears and continued inflows into the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Analysts expect the momentum to continue and Bitcoin to surge to $200,000 by the end of the year.

The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.
Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption.

SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  
After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. 
Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said.

One of the biggest winners is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

Bitcoin tags $108,000 for the first time since the day of its current all-time highs in January.

Traders and analysts mention support extending toward $90,000, but the probability of a retest is fading.

Near-term upside targets include a “blow-off top” at $128,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) spiked to more than $108,000 on May 21, marking new four-month highs. Where will BTC/USD go next?
Crypto traders and analysts are lining up their forecasts with BTC price action less than 1.5% away from new all-time highs.

BTC price support test now “less likely”
Bitcoin continues to coil below what is now its most significant psychological resistance barrier, January’s all-time highs.

In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. 
“Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said.

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence.
