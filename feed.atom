By default, dbt builds all development models flatly within a user's development schema, as shown below:
DEV_DB
├── dev_tom
│   ├── stg__model_a
│   ├── stg__model_b
│   └── int__model_c
└── dev_jerry
    ├── stg__model_a
    ├── stg__model_b
    └── int__model_c

This is different to production where models are built nestedly, being built in schemas specified in schema.yml files. https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/schema for more details.
PROD_DB
├── staging
│   ├── stg__model_a
│   └── stg__model_b
└── intermediate
    └── int__model_c

While this does fulfil the need of separated dev environments where devs can dev without worrying about stepping on the toes on other devs, if your project meets uses dev dataset that:

I spent over 5 hours just trying to install Git. Not because it’s super complicated — but because my laptop is slow, my internet is slower, and everything just felt like it was moving in slow motion. It was frustrating, but I finally got it done.
That one task pushed me to 25% of The Odin Project’s Foundations course. It’s a small step, but it feels huge right now.
After that, I looked at the next topic: Git Basics. And wow... it’s a lot. There’s so much reading, understanding, and hands-on stuff. I could tell right away I’d need a fresh, rested brain to tackle it — and today was definitely not that day.
To be honest, I’m completely drained. My sleep schedule is all over the place. I barely know what day it is anymore. I even missed my Duolingo streak — opened the app and it hit me:
I try to plan things, but it’s hard. Everything takes longer than expected, and I get distracted so easily. I don’t even take real breaks — I just lose track of time, then remember I needed a break hours later.

Today was one of those days where ADHD really got in the way.
Anyways, I’m not going to beat myself up over it. Some days are just rough. Some days all you can do is one thing — and that’s okay.
I did what I could. Tomorrow, I’ll come back to it with a clearer head (hopefully after some actual sleep).
And if you're going through something similar — just know you're not alone.]]></summary>

But I found an easy solution to setup the db shema. 
At the first step, you need to obtain a dump of a development db and import it using mysql. This needs to run every time you create a fresh db instance:
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u dbusr -pXXXX somedb < dump.sql

Each time you drop and recreate the db, import the dump it is a good idea to keep it upon your hard disk.
Then I use symfony's shema:update and I post-process it (it can generate some unwanted sql):
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql | \

One key decision when building APIs is how and where to handle authentication. A common pattern is to delegate authentication to a dedicated authentication microservice, which issues tokens (e.g., JWTs), and use those tokens to access protected resources on independent backend APIs. When working on an infrastructure change, we faced the challenge of either integrating authentication in the Node.js backend (without the proper libraries) or maintaining a single backend solely for authorization.
The options we considered were:

👁️ A Developer’s Look Into the Most Advanced Visual System We Know: The Human Brain
But long before we had GPUs and PyTorch, evolution had already coded the ultimate visual model: the human visual cortex.
This article unpacks what developers, AI engineers, and machine learning enthusiasts can actually learn from the visual brain — not as metaphor, but as software architecture.
🔬 Neuroscience as Architecture: Lessons from Nature
Retina = Real-Time Signal Preprocessing


V1 Cortex = Orientation Filters


Feedback Loops = Adaptive Context


Saccades = Intelligent Sampling


Plasticity = Lifelong Learning



💡 So, What Can Coders Learn?
Let’s build models that are adaptive, context-aware, and designed for lifelong learning — just like the brain.

TypeScript catches errors early by adding type safety to JavaScript.
Vite is a fast build tool that makes development smoother.
Alongside these, I also added tools like ESLint and Prettier. ESLint checks my code for errors, and Prettier makes sure everything is formatted nicely.

The Notification Pattern addresses this problem by collecting all errors in a notification object, allowing them to be handled in a structured way and presented to the user clearly and efficiently.
The Notification Pattern is a design strategy that collects validation errors rather than throwing exceptions immediately. It allows your application to gather multiple issues in one go and report them collectively, which is especially useful when validating complex domain objects.

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[United States Vice President JD Vance took the stage to deliver a keynote address at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, encouraging Bitcoiners to deepen their involvement in politics.
Vance highlighted the strategic and geopolitical importance of Bitcoin, emphasizing that the US should maintain leadership in the crypto industry to remain competitive in the age of digital finance. Vance told the audience:
"What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we do not make the right decisions. The first thing that I would ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond."

Conduit markets its payment system as an alternative to the messaging network SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Banks have relied on the SWIFT protocol to process wire transfers since the 1970s. 
Conduit claims its platform offers a modern alternative, enabling near real-time cross-border settlements by combining stablecoins with local fiat currencies through crypto infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams.

Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.

Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.
Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home.
Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset. 
Moreover, on the regulatory front, the return of a US President Donald Trump administration signals a friendlier …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top Bitcoin (BTC) bulls in 2025 have updated their price forecasts, and they range from a relatively cautious $130,000 to seven-figure moonshots.
Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.

In a May 28 announcement, the company said it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value.
Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin (BTC) buys.
The bonds are unsecured and not guaranteed, with neithe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Sony WF-C710N TWS earbuds launched a few months ago and are the successor to the WF-C700N. Designed as a budget-friendly option, the WF-C710N features a few upgrades from its older counterpart, namely improved ANC and longer battery life. Given that these aren’t Sony’s top-of-the-line offering, one should not expect them to be particularly mindblowing. […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks says the US could buy more Bitcoin if the government can fund the purchase in a “budget-neutral” way without a tax or adding to the growing national debt.
Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

Guo will face the court on “allegations relating to multiple breaches of his directors’ duties,” the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a May 28 press release.
ASIC alleged Guo made multiple breaches of directors’ duties relating to his dealings with ACX Exchange customer funds, and claimed he made false and misleading statements about those dealings and failed to maintain proper books and records. 
The now-liquidated Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from mid-2016 until December 2019, when it collapsed as customers could no longer withdraw their assets.
