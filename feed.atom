        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all want to write clean, maintainable code — but sometimes it feels like a constant battle. You’ve probably heard all the usual advice: use meaningful variable names, follow style guides, refactor regularly. But there’s a hidden trick to writing cleaner code that no one talks about.
This trick isn’t just about syntax or formatting. It’s about structuring your code to express intent clearly. When your code shows why something exists, not just how it works, it becomes much easier for you and others to understand and maintain it. This can mean using mental models or patterns that map your code to real-world concepts and behaviors.
Why is this overlooked? Most tutorials focus on quick fixes like style or small refactors, but they miss the deeper design mindset. Embedding intention into code design takes more thought upfront — something many avoid because of tight deadlines or old habits.
So how do you apply this in practice? Start by giving every function or module a clear, focused purpose. Group related logic into small components that reflect real concepts from your domain. Use mental models like commands, queries, or events to organize behavior. Before finishing, ask yourself: “If I came back in six months, would I immediately understand why this exists?”
You’ll notice several benefits right away: your code becomes easier to maintain, onboarding teammates gets faster, code reviews are smoother, and you build less technical debt over time.
The next time you write code, try to go beyond style and syntax. Think about the intent behind your work. And if you have your own hidden tricks for writing clean code, I’d love to hear them!]]></summary>

  Everything You Ever Wondered About SQL Performance: Deep Dive


This is not your typical SQL tuning talk. We’re deep diving --> beyond basic indexing tips --> into how modern relational databases actually parse, plan, and execute your queries.
Do you know how SQL is parsed?
Why does the optimizer sometimes pick the “wrong” plan?
Along the way we'll stumble upon subtle ways things can go wrong!
How can correlated subqueries sabotage execution?
When do query rewrites go sideways?
From PostgreSQL's bitmap scans to SQL Server's parallelism quirks to MySQL's index merge madness - learn to spot performance killers and know exactly which optimization lever to pull.
If you've ever stared at a slow query wondering "what exactly is the database doing right now?" - find the answer in this talk. Packed with example code, edge cases, and real-world pathologies, it’s everything you’ve ever wanted to know about SQL performance (and probably a few things you didn’t - but should!).
You'll walk away knowing exactly what to do when a query runs slow. Instead of randomly adding indexes and hoping for the best, you'll systematically diagnose performance problems by reading execution plans like a roadmap to the bottleneck. You'll recognize optimizer mistakes, know when a table scan is actually faster than an index, and understand why that "helpful" CTE is secretly destroying your performance.
Most importantly, you'll think like the database itself. Predict which queries will be fast, which will be disasters, and how to rewrite the disasters into successes. No more mystery, no more guesswork, just the confidence that comes from understanding what's actually happening under the hood.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of microservices, communication between systems needs to be efficient, secure, and well-defined. That’s where gRPC comes in—a modern framework created by Google that’s gaining traction among architects and backend developers.
What is gRPC?
HTTP/2: multiplexing, lower latency, and streaming support
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf): lightweight, fast binary serialization
Service contracts (.proto files): strongly typed, auto-generate code in multiple languages
Why we adopted gRPC in our .NET project
Low latency data exchange (JSON was too heavy)
Guaranteed contracts between different services
Bidirectional communication (client/server streaming)
With gRPC, we achieved:
Payload reduction by up to 70%
Eliminated contract mismatches between services
Stable real-time streaming
Easy integration with Load Balancer + Traefik
Tech stack used:
.NET 8
gRPC with C# (both code-first and contract-first with .proto)
Docker + Docker Compose
Traefik as reverse proxy with HTTP/2 support
Observability with OpenTelemetry



Feature
REST
gRPC




Protocol
HTTP/1.1
HTTP/2


Data format
JSON
Protobuf (binary)


Performance
Medium
High


Contract
Swagger/OpenAPI (opt)
Protobuf (mandatory)


Streaming
Limited
Bidirectional


Browser support
Full
Limited (not native)



Ideal scenarios for gRPC:
High-volume internal systems
Microservice communication
Real-time processes (logs, chat, event queues)
Cross-stack backend integrations (e.g., Java ↔ .NET)
Cautions when using gRPC:
Browsers don’t natively support gRPC (use gRPC-Web as a workaround)
Debugging can be more complex than REST
Versioning requires careful design (Protobuf best practices)
Final tip:
If you want efficiency, standardization, and scalability, gRPC is worth trying. But remember: it’s not a direct REST replacement, rather a powerful tool for specific use cases.]]></summary>

When building smart contracts on Aptos using Move, security and efficiency are paramount. One critical aspect is resource management and preventing unbounded execution.
Why It Matters
In Move, unbounded execution happens when a function loops over a data structure (like a list) that can grow infinitely, consuming excessive gas and potentially causing transactions to fail. Similarly, storing all user data in a single global structure can make your contract vulnerable to attacks and inefficient. 
Real-World Example
Imagine running an online marketplace on Aptos, like eBay, where users place buy orders for items. All orders are stored in one global list accessible to everyone. An attacker could flood the list with thousands of fake orders, making it slow or impossible to search f…]]></summary>

Cool. You want fries with that too?
If you’ve ever worked as a developer, you know the question.

How long will this take?

Give me a ballpark.

Just need a quick number for planning...
Let’s be clear:

Asking for an engineering estimate without requirements, context, or time to think is like ordering a pizza without saying what toppings you want—or if you even have an oven.
And then being mad when it’s late, cold, and full of regret.
You can’t expect accurate answers to questions you haven’t finished asking.

When someone says:
“How long to integrate this third-party tool?”

“What’s the ETA on this bug?”

“Can you guess how long the refactor will take?”
...and provides zero detail, the only honest estimate is 🤷‍♂️.
Bad estimates aren’t the problem.

Using estimates as commitments, ammo, or leverage—that’s the problem.
We see it happen all the time:
PM gets an offhand guess, puts it on a timeline

Feature explodes in complexity

Devs are blamed for “slipping”
That’s not leadership. That’s corporate gaslighting.
Give clear requirements

Let devs break down the work

Encourage “I don’t know yet” as a valid response

Ask for ranges, not single-point answers

Don’t use estimates as truth—use them as a conversation
If it sounds like more effort… that’s because it is.

But it also means your team will trust you more, deliver more accurately, and spend less time rage-Googling “how to undo a commit from 6 days ago.”
Don’t treat dev time like takeout.

Stop asking for estimates like you’re ordering pizza.
Estimation isn’t fast food—it’s forecasting.

And if you're not bringing context, collaboration, and a little patience,

you’re just setting the table for a delivery disaster.
