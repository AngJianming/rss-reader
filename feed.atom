Most of us have been there: you're looking at a company — maybe for a job, maybe for curiosity — and you wonder "What’s really going on behind their glossy careers page?" Is it a great place to work or just a PR-fueled mirage?
So I built an OSINT-style AI agent that gathers public information about companies from multiple sources. It’s not a recruiter bot. It’s the one doing background checks before you even click Apply.
The tool collects data from:
LinkedIn 
Crunchbase 
Glassdoor

Search news to surface any recent scandals or milestones
Once all the data is collected, the tool generates a short summary of what it found — recent news, company reputation, signals from employee reviews and public profiles. Then it assigns a sim…]]></summary>

That was me, battling a bloated spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc. It lagged, formulas froze, and formatting glitched. I'd been loyal to LibreOffice for years, especially on Linux. But that day, it let me down.
So I started looking around.
🧐 I tried WPS Office — too flashy.
And then I found ONLYOFFICE.
Linux users are spoiled for choice — until it comes to productivity suites. While LibreOffice has held the crown for years, it's not without flaws. Performance issues, UI inconsistencies, and compatibility hiccups can slow you down. That’s why having a reliable, modern alternative is more important than ever.
I almost dismissed it because of the name. But the install was light, and the experience? Shockingly good.
✅ Perfect formatting from my old LibreOffice files
Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS
ONLYOFFICE integrates smoothly into popular Linux distributions. Whether you’re on Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, or something more obscure, it just works. Flatpak, Snap, DEB, RPM — you name it, they support it.
✨ Cross-Platform: True plug-and-play experience across devices.
LibreOffice still has its place, and I’ll always appreciate its role in open-source history. But when it comes to a practical, polished alternative — especially one that works across all platforms — ONLYOFFICE just hits different.
So if you're looking for a no-compromise office suite that works seamlessly across your devices, give ONLYOFFICE a spin.
👉 You might just uninstall LibreOffice the same day.
Tried ONLYOFFICE already? Drop your experience below — especially if you’ve been on the LibreOffice train for years. Let’s swap stories!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Risk and Issue Management is not a one-time activity—it’s an ongoing process that helps ensure a project stays on track. Managing these elements properly requires following a structured approach. Below are the key steps involved, explained in detail.
The first and most critical step is identification. This involves recognizing potential risks (future uncertainties that could affect the project) and issues (problems that are already occurring). Teams can use brainstorming sessions, expert judgment, past project data, and checklists to capture as many risks and issues as possible.

Once identified, the next step is to assess each risk or issue in terms of its:
Likelihood of occurrence (for risks)
Severity or impact on the project goals (time, cost, scope, quality)
This step helps prioritize which items need immediate attention and which can be monitored.
After assessment, teams should create response plans:
For risks: Avoid, mitigate, transfer, or accept the risk.
For issues: Define corrective actions and assign responsibilities for resolution.
Having pre-planned strategies ensures quick action when needed, reducing disruption.
Risk and Issue Management is not static. As the project evolves, new risks may appear and existing risks may change. That’s why continuous monitoring is crucial. Teams should regularly review their risk and issue logs, update the status, and adjust the project plan accordingly.
By following these key steps—identification, assessment, response planning, and monitoring—project teams can effectively manage uncertainties. This process leads to greater project stability, fewer surprises, and higher success rates, making Risk and Issue Management a vital part of every project plan.]]></summary>

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and he expects a successful attack to be “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% at…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🗥️ So I was casually doomscrolling X (yes, again)... when I stumbled upon a post by DEV Community that made my brain short-circuit:
✨ “ScoutDB turns plain English into MongoDB queries.”
Wait, what?!
You've got the data questions, but not always the query-fu:
"Find all users who joined after Jan 2023 and liked more than 5 posts"

Normally, you'd need to hand-craft some MongoDB incantation like:
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { joinDate: { $gte: ISODate("2023-01-01") }, likes: { $gt: 5 } } }
])

But what if you could skip the syntax pain?
ScoutDB is like having a friendly AI that:
✅ Understands what you're trying to ask in English
explore like a boss
You type:
Show me all posts with more than 100 likes created in the last 30 days

ScoutDB replies with:
db.posts.find({
  likes: { $gt: 100 },
  createdAt: { $gte: new Date(Date.now() - 30*24*60*60*1000) }
})

Then maps the results and relationships for you in a visual explorer.
No more $lookup headaches. No more crying in JSON.
Saw this post by @thepracticaldev on X 👇
(I swear MongoDB and ScoutDB logos look like they just agreed to rescue all devs from query hell)

🗣️ English → MongoDB query? ✅
🧠 Auto-maps your schema? ✅
🎨 Visual canvas for data exploration? ✅
🧣 Found it while doomscrolling Twitter? BIG ✅
🧵 Original Post from DEV Community






💬 So, are you still writing $match manually or are you letting ScoutDB take the wheel?

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Siu pointed to the $3 trillion global student loan market as an untapped opportunity for the crypto industry. He said moving even 10% of that market onchain could significantly boost DeFi’s growth.
“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages.

XRP is retesting a falling wedge breakout, which could lead to a rally toward $3.60.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.
Will XRP’s price sustain the recovery or drop further in the coming days? Let’s examine.

New Bitcoin price targets leverage interplay with gold to deliver $200,000 and higher this year.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model.

Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end.

 
Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.
Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. 
The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.
Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.

On May 16, xAI provided an update on the Grok AI chatbot’s inflammatory responses, stating that on May 14, “an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X.”
“This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added.
The firm stated that it had conducted a thorough investigation and is implementing measures to enhance the AI chatbot’s transparency and reliability.

The bad actors have been operating since April, using deepfake voice messages and text messages to masquerade as senior government officials and establish rapport with victims, the FBI said in a May 15 warning. 
“If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said.  
If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is an ongoing race across the world for Bitcoin accumulation, according to Eric Trump, the second-eldest son of US President Donald Trump. Speaking at a crypto conference in Toronto on May 15, Trump said that from families to government funds, “everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.” 
The remarks came during a panel at Consensus 2025. Sharing the stage with Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8, Trump said Bitcoin adoption has been incredible.
“I'm traveling. I'm on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaway:

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asset tokenization is set to accelerate the movement of capital across traditional markets, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Nazarov said the shift will boost capital velocity in asset classes such as treasuries, equities, private credit, commercial debt, and real estate.
"I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily," Nazarov said on May 14. 
The remarks came on the same day Chainlink announced a partnership with Kinexys, a blockchain network for institutional-grade tokenized assets by JP Morgan, and digital asset firm Ondo Fi…]]></summary>
