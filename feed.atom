Hey Dev.to fam! 👋
I’m thrilled to share a new milestone for Razen, the programming language I’ve been passionately developing. We’ve just released v0.1.695, now in Beta, focused on making Razen leaner, more reliable, and developer-friendly — especially when it comes to error handling and library support.
Razen is still early-stage but rapidly evolving. The Beta status means:
The core syntax and libraries are mostly stable, ready for serious exploration
We’re actively gathering community feedback to shape future features
Some APIs and tokens are still in flux (like the recent token removals), aiming for a clean, maintainable language
If you like being on the cutting edge, diving into language …]]></summary>

Introduction:
Rate limiting and throttling are crucial mechanisms for managing the flow of requests to a system, especially APIs. They prevent overload and ensure fair access for all users. While often used interchangeably, they have subtle differences.  Rate limiting defines a specific number of requests allowed within a given time window, while throttling adjusts the rate dynamically based on system load.
Prerequisites:
Implementing rate limiting and throttling requires careful consideration of:
Request identification:  Unique identifiers (IP addresses, API keys) are needed to track request rates.
Time window: Defining the appropriate timeframe (e.g., per second, minute, hour) for counting requests.
Limit enforcement: Choosing a mechani…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pipelining is a technique used in microprocessors(what is microprocessor?) to increase instruction throughput — the number of instructions that can be executed in a given amount of time — by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions.

Analogy: Assembly Line
Instead of building one car at a time from start to finish,
Different stations (like engine fitting, painting, testing) work
simultaneously on different cars.
Likewise, in pipelining:
Different stages of instruction execution are processed in parallel.
Basic Pipeline Stages

Example: Without vs With Pipelining

In pipelining, a new instruction enters the pipeline every clock cycle, so multiple instructions are being processed at once — each in a different stage.
Advantages of Pipelining
 Higher throughput
 Better CPU performance
 Efficient use of CPU resources
Limitations / Hazards

Solutions include:
Forwarding, stalling, and branch prediction techniques.
Used In:
8086 (basic pipelining: Fetch + Execute)
Modern processors (ARM, x86) with deep pipelines (10+ stages)
Super-scalar and out-of-order execution]]></summary>

Whether it's a new framework, a handy utility, or a build tool, npm install is a command we type almost subconsciously. But how often do we stop to consider what's actually installed on our system or within our projects?
Knowing how to list your npm packages is more than just curiosity; it's a fundamental skill for debugging, understanding project dependencies, and maintaining a healthy development environment. Let's dive into the essential commands you need to master.
Before we get to the "how," let's quickly touch on the "why":

“It’ll be simple,” they said.
It wasn’t.
