Lately, stablecoins are everywhere — this time around, headed by “traditional” financial institutions. Bank of America and Standard Chartered are considering launching their own stablecoin, joining JPMorgan, which launched its stablecoin, JPM Coin — rebranded as Kinexys Digital Payments — to facilitate transactions with their institutional clients on their blockchain platform, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). 
Mastercard plans to bring stablecoins to the mainstream, joining Bleap Finance, a crypto startup. The aim is to enable stablecoins to be spent directly onchain — without conversions or intermediaries — seamlessly integrating blockchain assets with Mastercard’s global payment rails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm LunaStev, the developer of Wave.
We are very pleased to introduce Wave 'v0.1.0-pre-beta' —
Introduced import("..."); statement in Wave syntax.


Supports importing .wave source files relative to the current file's directory.


Prevents duplicate imports automatically using an internal HashSet.


Imported files are parsed, converted to AST, and merged into the main program at compile time.


Enables modular project structure by allowing multi-file composition.



  
  
  🔧 Bug Fixes


  
  
  🐞 UTF-8 Handling in Lexer




Fixed tokenizer crash on non-ASCII characters.


Lexer now correctly processes UTF-8 multi-byte characters, enabling support for Korean and other languages in source code.



  
  
  🐞 Underscore (_) Support in Identifiers




Variable and function names can now contain underscores.


Lexer now treats identifiers like my_var or some_function as valid.





  
  
  Showcase







Thank you for using Wave! Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I am the developer of a small project called Deletor, a utility for cleaning files on Go. I want to tell you why open source is cool, and how you can start small.
Why Open Source? I started with a simple one: I wanted to make a convenient tool for myself. But when I posted the code on GitHub, I realized that open source is not about "free code." It's about:
- Sharing experiences with other developers
- Getting feedback from real users
- An opportunity to learn from those who review your code
Why participate? When I see a new PR in Deletor, it's always inspiring. Someone took their time to improve my project. And you know what? It works both ways.
Participation in open source is:
- Practice working with real code
- The opportunity to get a quick feedback
- A chance to learn how to write code that is understandable to others
Deletor as a launching pad. Deletor is not a huge project with thousands of stars. It's utility, but it has everything you need to get started.:
- Clear code structure
- Active issues of different difficulty levels
- Quick code review (usually within 24 hours)
What will you get?
- Practical experience working with Go
- Feedback from experienced developers
- The ability to add a real project to your portfolio
- New acquaintances in the community
Conclusion. Open source is not about the size of a project or the number of stars. It's about people who want to create something useful together.
Deletor is a great project to start with because:
- It is small, but contains all the necessary components.
- We have a friendly community.
- We quickly answer questions and review the code.
Join us! Let's do something cool together.]]></summary>

Cron runs jobs repetitively, if you want to just run a command once there's another Unix utility called at which will not be explained here.

Recently I decided to deep dive into OpenID and whole AuthZ/AuthN/Web-app security staff. As I'm Java Dev I decided to write my own blocks. I will use Spring's Authorization Server/Resource Server/OAuth2 Client starters to build that. My starting point is to achieve simple AuthN + AuthZ with something which Auth0 calls "Universal Login". So I want to allow user to Sign Up/Sign In via Socials like GH/Google etc. and store that as a registered client with ID Token to authenticate and Access/Refresh tokens to Authorize... But "bigger problem" and I'm not sure how companies are solving that is allowing an user to Sign Up/Sign In with his own credentials (email + passsword) for example. Would be great to use same Authorization path.
How should I solve that? Would be great if you would be able to provide some links/materials/books etc. how this flow (probably common one, as currently almost every company allows registration/login flow like this) should be implemented?
Thanks!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[UnitDesk stands out with its emphasis on modularity and customization. Instead of a monolithic application, it's structured around individual widget "units." This means you can pick and choose the information you want to see – CPU/RAM/GPU usage, disk space, time/date – and arrange it exactly how you like.
Key Features Developers Will Appreciate:
  Modular Architecture: Based on SOLID principles, UnitDesk encourages clean code and easy extension. Adding new widgets is straightforward thanks to the BaseWidget class and a well-defined widget lifecycle.
  WPF and C#: Leverages the power of Windows Presentation Foundation for rich, hardware-accelerated UI and the robustness of C#. A familiar stack for many Windows developers.
  Hardware Monitoring with LibreHardwareMonitor: Integrates with the reliable LibreHardwareMonitor library, providing accurate and detailed system information.
  Extensibility: The framework is designed for developers to create custom widgets. The documentation clearly outlines how to inherit from BaseWidget and implement the necessary methods.
  Clean Desktop Integration: Widgets are designed to be lightweight and semi-transparent, blending seamlessly with the desktop. Features like drag-and-drop positioning and position persistence enhance the user experience.
Check out the UnitDesk GitHub repository (Unitdesk) to explore the code, contribute, or build your own custom widgets. Take control of your desktop monitoring!]]></summary>

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. 
Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AG…]]></summary>

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.

The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.

If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading.
NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients.

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is “part of our DNA,” the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

“You can use crypto incentives and disincentives to onboard users to onboard the ecosystem players,” Nailwal said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. 
He added that projects with effective onchain incentive structures might even “build a better AI because you have this incentive engine that brings in developers,” Nailwal said on May 1. 
Cointelegraph’s LONGITUDE is an event series that brings together leaders and innovators from the blockchain and Web3 space for exclusive discussions.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino reiterated that Tether had no plans to apply for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDt — the largest by market capitalization — to be compliant under MiCA in European countries, potentially forcing exchanges to delist the stablecoin. He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

“General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.”

Bitcoin pressures shorts after 3% daily gains
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to a sustained bullish trajectory.
“Stocks trade at a key area here,” he wrote in ongoing X analysis.
“I think the general rule is that if stocks do trade back above the .618 Fibonacci retracement after a big drop, the botto…]]></summary>

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security. 
This hack differs from earlier eras because it happened to a major global exchange that takes securit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

“There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem development organization Wonderland wrote in a May 1 X post. Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules.
“The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated.
