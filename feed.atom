        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In FastAPI, how route handlers (endpoints) behave in terms of parallelism and concurrency depends on whether they are defined using async def or def, and whether the work inside them is I/O-bound or CPU-bound.

Here are the four combinations of route handlers and how they affect parallel or concurrent handling of requests:
async def with async I/O-bound work (e.g., await asyncio.sleep, database calls)





@router.get("/async-io")
async def async_io_route():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return {"status": "async io"}

Handled concurrently
Non-blocking — multiple such requests can be handled at the same time.
Best performance for I/O tasks like DB queries, network calls, file access.

Why Events Are Needed
📱Imagine a food delivery app.
You click the “Order Now” button… and nothing happens🤷‍♂️.
No sound. No feedback. No confirmation. Just dead silence.
That’s what happens when a page doesn’t listen for user events. Without events:
You can’t respond to button clicks
Can’t handle form submissions
Can’t open/close modals
Can’t run animations or logic
Events are how JavaScript knows something has happened — and gives you a chance to respond.
Let’s jump into our main metaphor:
Scenario 1 – A waiter per table:
Now every time a customer waves, a different waiter responds.

Too much overhead

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s data-driven world, organizations generate massive amounts of data every second. To extract valuable insights from this data, it needs to be collected, transformed, and loaded efficiently — this is where ETL pipelines come into play.
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load — three fundamental steps in processing data:
Collect data from various sources such as databases, APIs, files, or streaming platforms.
Clean, filter, aggregate, and convert the data into a format suitable for analysis or storage.
Insert the transformed data into a destination system like a data warehouse, data lake, or database.
Data Integration: Consolidates data from diverse sources, providing a unified view.
Data Quality: Transformation steps clean and validate data to ensure accuracy.
Automation & Scalability: Automates repetitive tasks and scales as data volume grows.
Timely Insights: Enables near real-time or batch data updates for decision-making.
Source Data Systems
Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra)
APIs and third-party services
Flat files (CSV, JSON, XML)
Streaming data (Kafka, Kinesis)
Extraction Layer


Connectors and adapters to read data


Full or incremental extraction strategies


Transformation Layer


Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values)


Data enrichment (joining datasets, adding derived columns)


Data normalization and standardization


Business logic implementation




Loading Layer
Batch or streaming loading techniques
Target systems such as:
Data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery)
Data lakes (S3, HDFS)
Analytical databases
Common ETL Pipeline Architectures
: Runs ETL jobs at scheduled intervals (hourly, daily). Suitable for large volumes with latency tolerance.
Processes data in near real-time as it arrives. Useful for time-sensitive applications like fraud detection.
Combines batch and streaming based on data and business needs]]></summary>

Let’s break down why:
🕹️ Real-Time Games Are Driving Innovation
🔐 Web3 and Crypto Integration
Removing KYC for selected geos
Offering provably fair games using blockchain
Integrating wallet-as-login solutions (like MetaMask)
All of this requires devs to work across Solidity, RPC, and EVM-compatible chains.
🎯 Personalization With AI
Predict player LTV
Trigger bonuses based on behavior
Detect addiction patterns in real time
It’s a mix of data science, ethics, and UX — all under one roof.
🚀 Why This Matters for Developers
Solve real-time performance challenges
Build complex APIs with financial risk handling
Explore gaming, blockchain, and machine learning in one product
It’s where gaming meets fintech.
🧠 Final Thought
If you’re a developer tired of building "yet another SaaS dashboard", this space will challenge you technically and creatively.

The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin believes there are risks to this setup.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) said in a May 18 statement that it seized nearly 25 Bitcoin (BTC), alongside the mansion and car, which are together worth a total of 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million).
The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18.
Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a "money transmitting business" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023.
Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

One target demands $116,000 next week, moving BTC/USD firmly out of its narrow range.

A quick dip before continuing higher is among the options for BTC price action into the new week.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s next explosive move could send the asset to $250,000 by the end of 2025, according to Scott Melker, a crypto analyst and host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast.
Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

According to New Zealand Police, the man is one of 13 individuals charged after authorities executed search warrants across Auckland, Wellington, and California over the past three days.
