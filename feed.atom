If you work with data, automate research, or build anything that involves gathering online information, web scraping is likely part of your workflow. The challenge is that scraping today‚Äôs websites is not as easy as it once was. The good news is that tools like Perplexity AI and Crawlbase can make your scraping stack more efficient, intelligent, and scalable.
In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through how I use Perplexity AI for web scraping in Python and why combining it with Crawlbase‚Äôs scraping API has helped me build more powerful data pipelines.

This article will explore possible reasons for this behavior, provide insights into why it happens, and offer a detailed solution.
Understanding Your Code Structure
From your provided code snippets, we notice that you are employing a combination of Stack and Tab navigators using the Expo Router. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of your current file structure:

The emergence of web technologies has ushered in a new era of interactivity and real-time applications. However, with such capabilities comes the critical responsibility of user privacy and consent. The Permissions API was standardized as part of the broader movement to provide enhanced privacy practices on the web, enabling developers to manage user permissions more systematically.
The Permissions API was introduced to address the concerns posed by previous blind consent models, which often left users unaware of the degree of access they were granting.

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment.¬†

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears.¬†

88% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000‚Äì$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.¬†

Gold‚Äôs climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious ‚Äî illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast ‚Äî but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds ‚Äî sometimes thousands ‚Äî of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup¬†survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights ‚Äúconstraints and gaps in funding for education,‚Äù the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
‚ÄúWe hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.‚Äù
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its ‚ÄúIgnite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance‚Äù to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you‚Äôre not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let‚Äôs unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump‚Äôs memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

A breakout above $2.18 could invalidate the bearish pattern.

The XRP (XRP) price flashes warning signs as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its daily chart, coinciding with declining network activity.¬†

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It‚Äôs like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time.¬†
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e‚Ä¶]]></summary>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress.¬†
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.¬†
Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption.
