🚀 Enter: The Discussion Section
Saw how using a HashSet could eliminate the need for sorting entirely.
🤯 Mind-Blown Moment
💡 Key Takeaways
🔍 Don’t skip the Discussions tab — it’ll challenge your assumptions.
🧠 Understanding HashSet behavior unlocks powerful optimizations.
✍️ Writing logic by hand helps internalize edge cases and control flow.
🔄 Nested loops ≠ O(n²) — it depends how the data is traversed.

Imagine you run a web app on ALB or CloudFront. Suddenly, a botnet floods your /login endpoint with thousands of fake login requests per second.
Without this new feature:
You would’ve had to analyze logs, manually create WAF rules, and deploy mitigations — usually too late.
With this new update:
✅ WAF automatically:
Detects the traffic anomaly
Applies CAPTCHA challenges or blocks malicious requests
Keeps your service stable and available
Baseline Learning: WAF observes your traffic and learns normal behavior patterns.
Detection: If something spikes — like login abuse, slow POSTs, or odd User-Agents — it gets flagged.
Mitigation: WAF applies auto-generated rules to block or challenge the traffic instantly.
All of this happens without any manual configuration — although you can still customize responses.
This protection works with:
🌐 Amazon CloudFront
⚖️ Application Load Balancer (ALB)
🚪 API Gateway, App Runner, AWS Cognito, and more
✅ Zero config to get started (just enable the managed rule group)
🧠 ML-based detection means smarter responses
⏱️ Near-instant protection = less downtime
💼 Ideal for SREs and Cloud Security Engineers who need peace of mind
AWS WAF now detects and blocks Layer 7 DDoS attacks automatically using machine learning — with zero disruption, no manual effort, and instant response. 🎯
💬 Are you already using AWS WAF in production? What types of attacks have you faced at L7?]]></summary>

I used to spend my days fitting statistical models to price and hedge financial derivatives, way before Machine Learning was cool.
It was all about MATLAB (not my cup of tea, but my best friend at the time. Is that too sad? xD).
Apart from maths and MATLAB, a big part of my job was talking to traders, the guys at the bank that were using these models to make trading decisions that fit their (and the bank's) risk appetite.
Then something happened
Bloomberg terminals, fax machines, phone booths.
Risk management, portfolio construction, and of course trading.
One of the things that caught my attention, was the amount of screens showing Bloomberg news 24/7.
Traders would constantly have one eye on their Bloomberg terminal, and the other on Bloomberg news.

The magic lies in a powerful component called an authorization server, which uses specialized web addresses known as endpoints. Each endpoint has a specific role in ensuring secure authentication and authorization for applications. In this blog post, we’ll take a guided tour of these endpoints, exploring their functions and how they work together to keep your applications secure.





  
  
  What Are Endpoints?


Endpoints are URLs on an authorization server that applications interact with to perform authentication and authorization tasks. They are the backbone of protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), enabling secure communication between applications, users, and servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[好的！下面我给你写一个关于线程池的详细教程，帮助你理解线程池的概念、作用，以及如何在Java中使用线程池。
线程池（Thread Pool）是一个管理和复用多个线程的机制。它通过预先创建一定数量的线程，重复利用这些线程来执行任务，而不是每次都创建和销毁线程。
性能提升：减少了频繁创建和销毁线程的开销。
资源控制：限制同时运行的线程数量，避免资源耗尽。
任务管理：方便管理和调度大量异步任务。
Java标准库中，线程池由java.util.concurrent包中的Executor框架支持，常用类：
Executor：执行任务的接口。
ExecutorService：Executor的子接口，支持线程池管理。
ThreadPoolExecutor：线程池的核心实现类。
Java 5引入了Executors工具类，简化线程池创建。
Java提供了几种常用的线程池类型，可以通过Executors工厂方法创建：



线程池类型
说明
代码示例




FixedThreadPool
固定大小的线程池，线程数量固定
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)


CachedThreadPool
缓存线程池，线程数量不固定，适合执行大量短生命周期任务
Executors.newCachedThreadPool()


SingleThreadExecutor
单线程池，只有一个线程串行执行任务
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()


ScheduledThreadPool
支持定时和周期性任务执行
Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3)



这里用FixedThreadPool演示：

Mobile apps run on devices that have limited memory and storage — and let’s be honest, internet connections aren’t always reliable. Caching helps your app:
Load faster by avoiding repeated API calls


Work offline or in poor network conditions


Feel smoother by loading images and data locally




  
  
  🧰 Types of Caching in React Native


Not all caching is created equal. Let’s look at the most useful types:
This is the quickest way to cache data, storing it temporarily in the app’s memory.
Great for UI state or short-lived data


Libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React’s Context API can handle this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🆕 What's New?



Amazon ECS just made life easier for container users!
You can now update the capacity provider configuration of an existing ECS service without needing to recreate the service. This means you can seamlessly switch between EC2 and Fargate, or even balance across both — all without service disruption.
Before this update:
You had to recreate your ECS service to switch capacity providers.
That meant: reconfiguring load balancers, updating pipelines, and risking downtime.
Now:
Simply use the UpdateService API or AWS Console to switch providers.
Zero service recreation. Zero downtime.
Say your ECS service web-api-service is currently running on EC2.
You now want to shift to Fargate to reduce infra management.
You can run this:
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster my-cluster \
  --service web-api-service \
  --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1


➡️ Done! Your service will begin replacing EC2 tasks with Fargate tasks smoothly.
You can also mix both:
--capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=FARGATE,weight=1 capacityProvider=EC2,weight=1


This splits traffic 50/50 between EC2 and Fargate.
🟦 EC2 Auto Scaling groups
🟩 AWS Fargate
🔁 Mixed strategies
🧰 AWS Console or CLI
Old Way: Recreate service to switch compute backend (risky & manual)
New Way: Just update the capacity provider — smooth, fast, and safe ✅
Are you planning to migrate your ECS services to Fargate?
Or do you use both compute types for cost control?

I'm currently about 25% done with the story, and actively developing the game in C++ using SDL3. It’s a solo project, and I’m learning a lot as I go — both on the code side and the storytelling side.
The game, now called Kindleveil, is a 2D top-down emotional fantasy adventure. It’s about light, memory, sorrow, and mystery — all wrapped in a fog-covered world full of whispered truths and fading echoes. (Formerly called Lanternbound, in case you’ve seen my earlier posts elsewhere.)
🔧 Tech & Tools:
Language: C++
Library: SDL3
Build System: CMake
Engine: Fully custom, built from scratch
📝 What I’d Love:
Advice on writing devlogs — what makes people stop and read?
Feedback on how to stay consistent and not lose motivation over time
Thanks for checking this out! I’ll post progress as I build more of the world, the combat system, and especially the light-and-memory mechanics that shape everything. Let me know what kind of devlog content you enjoy reading — I’d love to improve!]]></summary>
