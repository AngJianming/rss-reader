        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[API keys used to be the go-to solution for securing mobile apps. But in 2025, that’s no longer good enough.
Reverse engineering, emulators, and bot traffic are making mobile backends more vulnerable than ever. Hardcoded API keys can’t tell you who’s making a request—or whether the app has been tampered with. That’s where native mobile security steps in.
Every time you ship an API key inside your app, you risk it being extracted, shared, or automated. Bots can simulate app behavior, spam your backend, and exploit free-tier resources.
You can rotate keys. You can obfuscate code. But you can’t secure what you can’t verify. And API keys alone give you zero context.
Android and iOS now support cryptographic attestation:
Play Integrity API (Android) checks device and app integrity.
App Attestation (iOS) uses a Secure Enclave key tied to your app.
These tools help you prove each request comes from the genuine app on a real device—closing the door on emulators, clones, and jailbroken systems.
Instead of relying on hardcoded secrets, more teams are issuing short-lived tokens (e.g., JWTs) only after attestation passes. This gives you:
Trust at runtime—not just at build time
The ability to flag low-integrity devices
Protection against token reuse and API scraping
As more apps adopt freemium models or expose APIs to third parties, the surface area for abuse grows. Native security features aren’t “nice to have” anymore—they’re critical infrastructure.
In 2025, secure API access in mobile apps means embracing the verification tools built into the OS. It’s the only scalable way to implement your mobile-to-api security strategy with confidence.
P.S. If you’re looking for a backend that handles attestation and token issuance out of the box, check out Calljmp—it’s built for mobile-first apps.]]></summary>

Multithreading in Java is the solution to give you better performance and speed while developing applications. In today’s world, speed and performance matters a lot, especially in software applications. From a web page loading through a mobile app running, users want everything instantly; they do not want any delay in their work. 
This is the reason Java is used with multithreading as it makes a program do all its functions simultaneously. This makes the application faster, more efficient, and more responsive.

What is multithreading? 


Running multiple threads simultaneously within a single program is called multithreading. A thread is like a small part of a program that can run a task separately.

Waiting for projects to compile, waiting for tests to run, especially when dealing with course designs involving network requests and high concurrency, the sluggish response speed simply made me question life. My roommates often complained too, wondering why these "toy" projects we wrote were so laggy. Until, by a stroke of luck, I encountered a framework that could be called "black technology." It completely overturned my understanding of web backend development and, for the first time, made my code feel like it was "taking off."
