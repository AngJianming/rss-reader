Background
I am working on an iOS app that uses Firebase Hosting for my json files and images, I want to load the data and cache them in SwiftData. In the beginning I thought Firebase Hosting works great for me, simple firebase deploy is all that needed to keep the files updated, no more git commits for Github pages where I used to store the files.
But, there can be problem with Firebase Hosting CDN caching the files, so it is best the set firebase no-cache.
Then in my iPhone 16 Pro iOS 18.4 simulator, I noticed that the json data could not be parsed. I tried with several simulators of iOS 18.4, all have the same problem. But there is no problem of fetching and parsing data when I use a physical iPhone with iOS 18.4. 
Research
Later I find out that this is a known issue with the latest macOS and iOS simulators, especially with Xcode 15.3+ and macOS Sonoma.
My simulator logs show:
Solution
So now I stick with the iPhone 12 Pro simulator on iOS 18.0 while Apple and Firebase resolve the instability on newer platforms.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,  
I am mahesh career changer from chef to IT ! 
I'm new to programming and currently working in test automation.  At my job, I'm using Playwright for UI testing, and I want to learn TypeScript/JavaScript properly to understand the framework better and improve my automation skills.  
Right now, I feel like I know enough to get scripts running, but I want to go deeper—writing clean test code, handling async operations effectively, and understanding best practices for working with Playwright.  
One of the biggest challenges I face is debugging. Sometimes tests fail due to timing issues, flaky selectors, or unexpected behaviors, and I want to improve my debugging skills. I also want to strengthen my fundamental programming concepts in TypeScript, such as:
Variables & Data Types (understanding type safety)
Functions & Async/Await (handling asynchronous operations efficiently)
Object-oriented programming (using classes and interfaces in test automation)
Best debugging techniques (breakpoints, logging, step-by-step execution in VS Code)
So, I’d love to hear from you:  
What are the best learning resources for TypeScript and JavaScript, especially for test automation?

Any Playwright-specific tutorials that helped you master the framework?

Best debugging techniques and tools for working with Playwright scripts?

How did you bridge the gap between using Playwright at work and actually understanding the framework in-depth?



Thanks in advance for your insights! Looking forward to learning from this community. 🚀]]></summary>

Converting LowerCase
