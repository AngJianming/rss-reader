        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Scalability
সমাধান: Redis Pub/Sub এবং socket.io adapter ব্যবহার করে load balancing করা যায়, যাতে multiple server instance একে অপরের সঙ্গে message sync করতে পারে।
2. Sticky Sessions Requirement
সমস্যা: যদি sticky session ঠিকমতো কনফিগার না করা হয়, তাহলে connection drop বা message loss হতে পারে।
সমাধান: Load balancer (যেমন Nginx বা HAProxy)-এ sticky session কনফিগার করতে হয় অথবা session-affinity enabled proxy ব্যবহার করা উচিত।
3. Connection Drop ও Reconnection Handling
সমাধান: ক্লায়েন্টে reconnect লজিক থাকা উচিত। Socket.io এই ফিচার built-in ভাবে দেয়।
4. Resource Usage ও Server Limitation
সমাধান:
Connection limit সেট করা
Idle connection timeout কনফিগার করা
সার্ভার instance স্কেল করা
5. Load Balancer Configuration
সমস্যা: যদি Load balancer upgrade এবং connection হেডারগুলো সঠিকভাবে forward না করে, তাহলে WebSocket কাজ করবে না।
সমাধান: Load balancer-এ WebSocket এর জন্য Upgrade হেডার, HTTP/1.1, এবং sticky session properly enable করতে হয়।
6. Firewall / Proxy Issues
সমাধান:
SSL ব্যবহার করে (wss://) secure connection চালানো
Proxy configuration অনুযায়ী WebSocket Upgrade হেডার সেট করা
Port allow করা (যেমন 3000, 8080, ইত্যাদি)
Security Concerns
WebSocket CORS, CSRF protection-এর মতো traditional web security layer automatically follow করে না। এই কারণে unauthorized access, XSS বা DDoS এর শিকার হতে পারে।
সমাধান:
Authentication middleware যোগ করা (যেমন JWT)
SSL/TLS encryption ব্যবহার করা
Rate limiting setup করা
8. Resource Cleanup
সমস্যা: Proper disconnect event handle না করলে unused socket connection থেকে RAM leak হয়।
সমাধান:
9. Protocol Standardization
সমাধান: JSON-based structured messaging বা custom protocol define করা।
10. Debugging এবং Monitoring কঠিন
সমাধান:
Custom logging middleware যুক্ত করা
Real-time monitoring tools যেমন Sentry, LogRocket ব্যবহার করা।
উপসংহার:
WebSocket চমৎকার একটি প্রযুক্তি যা রিয়েল-টাইম অ্যাপ্লিকেশন তৈরির জন্য খুবই উপযোগী। তবে এগুলোর ব্যবহারে উপরের চ্যালেঞ্জগুলো মাথায় রেখে সঠিকভাবে configuration ও architecture design করলে পারফরম্যান্স ও reliability দুটোই নিশ্চিত করা সম্ভব।]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott blamed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act’s failure on partisan politics during a Senate speech on May 8.
Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

After some research, I discovered that Vite + React was a better fit, and I found a great boilerplate that used PNPM as its package manager. That got me thinking: Why PNPM? Why not Yarn or NPM, which I’ve used before?  
So, I dug deeper into the differences between these package managers. Here’s what I learned—and which one you should choose.  
NPM (Node Package Manager)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana has yet to show convincing signs that it could surpass Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for institutions, as its revenue, heavily reliant on memecoins, is considered unstable, according to crypto bank group Sygnum.
In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The firm said on X on May 9 that it was making the cryptocurrency available to more than 100 million customers, adding that “the movement is just beginning,” before signing off as “Steaktoshi.” 
The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission has blasted her agency over its settlement letter that could finally end the Ripple legal saga. 
The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Coinbase’s total revenue fell 10% quarter-over-quarter to $2 billion in Q1, missing industry estimates by 4.1% as trading activity slowed across the market.
Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT), Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP surged on May 8, boosted by risk-on sentiment following US President Donald Trump’s teased trade deal with the UK.

Whale accumulation continues, with the number of addresses holding 10,000+ XRP rising steadily on price dips.

XRP broke above a key falling wedge resistance, increasing the chances of a rally toward $2.80–$3.66.

XRP’s (XRP) price gained 7.50% on May 8 to reach an intraday high of $2.27, mirroring similar upside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market.
Traders pushed the price higher amid Trump’s tariff threats, increased whale accumulation, and favorable chart technicals.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.
To address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.
The GENIUS Act was seen as a bipartisan effort to increase regulatory clarity for digital assets…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump was reportedly manipulated by a lobbyist tied to Ripple Labs into announcing the XRP (XRP) token would be part of his plans for a national cryptocurrency reserve.
According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.
