It seamlessly integrates with Jira and GitLab, offering insights into key metrics like active days, code review times, and task lifecycles. Oraculum helps engineering managers make data-driven decisions to optimize team performance and streamline workflows.
After implementing Oraculum, we identified top performers, low performers, and even made some tough decisions, including letting go of a few developers based on data insights.
We‚Äôd love feedback from engineers and team leads on how this could benefit your teams. If you're interested in learning more or testing it out, feel free to reach out!

FIFA will launch its ‚ÄúFIFA Blockchain,‚Äù with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and aims to provide ‚Äúbetter performance, future features, and improved scalability.‚Äù
As part of the move, FIFA Collect ‚Äî its official NFT collection ‚Äî will migrate from the Algorand blockchain to the new FIFA Blockchain. The migration is scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, FIFA said.

‚ÄúAt this stage, no immediate action is required. When the migration process begins, we will provide clear, step-by-step instructions on what (if anything) you need to do,‚Äù the announcement stated.
The collection‚Äôs migration will take place ‚Äúnot earlier than‚Äù May 20, FIFA said, adding that it will confirm the exact date and provide clear instructions for NFT holders.
Following the migration, external Algorand-based wallets such as Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will be able to connect to FIFA Collect via MetaMask or other EVM wallets that support WalletConnect.
Other listed collectibles will be automatically listed on the new platform, unless users delist them before the migration date.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

This post explores the innovative funding mechanism of yield farming within the blockchain ecosystem. It discusses how blockchain projects leverage yield farming to gain funding outside traditional channels, the mechanics behind liquidity pools and smart contracts, and the broader implications for decentralized finance (DeFi).

Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price over time, which indicates the uncertainty about the size of changes in an asset‚Äôs value.
Bitcoin (BTC) weekly volatility hit a 563-day low on April 30, said Vetle Lunde, the head of research at K33 Research.

As prices rise, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 28% from its five-month low below $75,000 reached on April 9. However, its failure to break above the $95,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the latest recovery may trap bulls.

Approving staking for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may have a minimal impact on inflows unless Ether sees a sustained rally, says Eric Balchunas

ETH dropped significantly in price after the launch of the ETFs last year, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw new all-time highs just two months after launching.

Balchunas said that for inflows to increase again, ETH would need a multimonth run and a strong narrative.

Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token‚Äôs price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening.¬†
According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the‚Ä¶]]></summary>

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.
