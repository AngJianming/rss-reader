        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There was a time when the em dash was a powerful tool in the writer’s arsenal—used to interrupt, to emphasize, to inject tone or rhythm into a sentence. I’ve used it for years, even had to Google it more times than I care to admit just to copy and paste the damn thing.
And then AI came along.
Now, you can barely read an article without seeing em dashes everywhere. It’s become something of a tell. If you see a piece overloaded with them, chances are someone’s whispering, “This was written by a GPT.”
Now, don't get me wrong. I use AI. I like AI. This very post even had some AI input. But let’s be clear: my voice is my own. I’m not giving up my favorite punctuation mark because the bots happen to like it a little too much.
I’m taking back the em dash.
Not because it’s trendy or controversial. Because it’s useful. Because sometimes a comma is too weak, and a period is too final. Because sometimes, an em dash says exactly what I want to say with just the right pause.
So if you see one in my writing, don’t assume anything—except that I meant to use it.]]></summary>

✍️ Originally published on The New Stack

📍 Also on ControlMonkey.io
Every bold initiative in 2025 — AI, global scale, digital transformation — depends on one thing: infrastructure.
But here’s the problem: too many still treat infra like plumbing. Something in the background. Something to maintain, not wield.
That mindset? It's becoming a liability.
Just like software delivery transformed 20 years ago, infrastructure is now being reshaped by:
Infrastructure-as-Code
Automation layers
Policy-as-code and governance controls
The goal? Make infrastructure delivery as fast and reliable as software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Terraform is one of the most popular tools for managing cloud infrastructure as code (IaC), and AWS is the most widely used cloud platform. The Terraform AWS Provider is what connects these two powerhouses.
In this short guide, we’ll cover:
What the Terraform AWS Provider does

How to set it up

Basic examples of infrastructure provisioning

Key best practices to avoid pitfalls



If you're looking for a deeper walkthrough, check out our complete Terraform AWS Provider Guide.
A Terraform provider is a plugin that lets Terraform communicate with external APIs — like those offered by AWS, Azure, GCP, and many more.
Providers come in three types:
Official — Maintained by HashiCorp (e.g., AWS, Azure)


Partner — Built by tech vendors who integrate via HashiCorp’s framework


Community — Open source contributions for niche or emerging platforms
The AWS provider falls in the official category and is arguably the most widely used.
Here’s a basic 4-step process to start using Terraform with AWS:
Install Terraform CLI from terraform.io

Install and configure the AWS CLI:




aws configure

Create a file named main.tf and paste the following block:
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "demo_vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  tags = {
    Name = "demo_vpc"
  }
}

Run the following commands:
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

✅ This will provision your VPC in AWS via the Terraform AWS Provider.
Having trouble with these steps? Here’s a detailed guide on how to troubleshoot and debug Terraform on AWS.
🔐 Bonus: Security Best Practices

✅ Don’t hardcode credentials — use environment variables or shared profiles

✅ Encrypt your Terraform state when stored in S3

✅ Use sensitive variables to prevent secrets from being exposed in outputs

Example:

variable "aws_access_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

It felt like the default path — everyone around me was on it, and society cheered it on. But when I stepped into the working world as a software engineer, I felt unexpectedly lost. Without the structure of school or passions outside of work, I poured everything into my job. The long hours debugging code, learning new frameworks, and chasing deadlines became my identity.

Permission Delegation is a proposed amendment to the XRPL that enables accounts to selectively delegate transaction permissions to other accounts. This mechanism enhances account usability by allowing account holders to distribute specific responsibilities—such as issuing tokens or authorizing trustlines—without relinquishing full control over their accounts.
By supporting fine-grained authorization, Permission Delegation unlocks new possibilities for multi-party workflows, external integrations, and advanced account management strategies, while maintaining a strong security posture.
To evaluate the performance implications of this feature, the RippleX performance team carried out targeted benchmarking to assess the impact of delegated transactions on ledger throughput, vali…]]></summary>
