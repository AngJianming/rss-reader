-
Let me tell you a little story about unintentional leadership in tech.
Everyone quit.
So now… I’m the CTO.
Not because I earned it. Not because I wanted it.
Let me paint a picture for you:
The CEO is still slinging “quick ideas” like pancakes at a bad diner.


The investors want “roadmap clarity,” even though we’re actively sinking.


The interns? Logging into Figma every morning like it means something.



The app is duct-taped together with half-dead microservices and a Redis instance that’s been sending me weird alerts since 2021. No one’s fixed billing in months. Someone set the deploy password to “12345” and then left the company.
I deploy on Fridays. Because nothing matters.
I didn’t climb to the top.
I’ve inherited a haunted codebase.
I answer customer support tickets.
But I’m here. I’m still showing up. And I guess that makes me “leadership” now.
Call it burnout. Call it commitment. Call it unpaid therapy.
Whatever this is, it’s not “the dream.”
I’m not a visionary. I’m not agile. I’m not optimizing anything.
I’m just the last developer standing—and apparently, that means I’m in charge.
Startups fail.
And sometimes, that person becomes the CTO.
Welcome to the worst promotion of your life.]]></summary>

To solve this, I created a flexible system where image assets are:
Organized by screen density (drawable-mdpi, hdpi, etc.),
Zipped into a single file,
Hosted on Firebase Hosting,
Downloaded and unzipped at runtime,
Loaded dynamically using file URIs.

In Kotlin, using sealed interfaces provides a structured way to represent restricted class hierarchies. However, ensuring that all implementations contain certain required elements can be tricky, especially when adhering to architectural constraints. This article explores a solution for enforcing required parameters in params maps across implementations of the AnalyticsCustomEvent interface.
Understanding the Current Implementation
In the provided Kotlin code, we have a sealed interface AnalyticsEvent that includes a nested interface AnalyticsCustomEvent. Each class that implements this interface can define the params map, which is crucial for passing data to an analytics service. Here’s a summary of the original code snippet:

This section verifies the most recent date to determine whether it is linked to the active directory or not.

If you enter an incorrect password in the managed system for the Active Directory section and then reset it in the connector, the dashboard for the managed system will display red data in the "Running Connector Status" section.

If you encounter an error in the IAM part, it will be highlighted in red. If you see a message stating "no active connectors found," it likely indicates an issue with the connection to the Active Directory, such as the Active Directory machine being turned off.
With these tips, you will be able to identify the issue and understand why it is not connecting.

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer.

Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …]]></summary>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

On May 9, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.
Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

Web3 and privacy-focused web browser Brave Browser has integrated the Cardano blockchain into its native and standalone wallets.
According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:
“Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analys…]]></summary>

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The government of Dubai has signed an agreement with crypto exchange Crypto.com to launch crypto payments for government services. 
The agreement, formalized during the Dubai fintech Summit on May 12, is part of Dubai’s cashless strategy, which hopes to foster the city’s transition to “a fully digital, cashless society,” by introducing “a new digital payment channel across its official platforms,” the Dubai Department of Finance (DOF) said on May 12.
Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval, will integrate the Mountain Protocol team, tech stack and licensing framework into Anchorage’s existing offerings, Anchorage said in a May 12 statement.
While terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, it reflects an accelerating number of acquisitions between crypto and TradFi firms in recent months.
