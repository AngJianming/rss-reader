        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was scrolling through Instagram Reels recently when an ad, presented as a "tutorial," caught my eye. It was for a Photoshop plugin called "DITHERTONE Pro," showcasing a rather striking visual effect ‚Äì lines that seemed to follow an image's contours, giving it a distinct, almost cyberpunk aesthetic. It genuinely looked impressive. Then, the price appeared: $75.
That figure made me pause. Not because I'm against paying for well-crafted software, but because the effect itself felt incredibly familiar. It was a strong sense of d√©j√† vu, like I'd seen this exact visual style generated somewhere else, in a context far removed from polished, commercial plugins.
My mind immediately jumped back a few years. I used to be quite involved in the datamoshing and glitch art scene ‚Äì not so much these day‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Whether you're new to crypto or an experienced DeFi user, this guide will help you understand how Ethereum staking works, how much you can earn, and what risks are involved.
Staking is the process of locking your ETH to help secure the Ethereum network. In Ethereum‚Äôs Proof of Stake (PoS) system, validators are selected to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In return, they earn ETH rewards.
Think of staking like earning interest on your crypto while supporting the network.
There are four main ways to stake Ethereum:

This is a typical BFS graph problem.
Approach :
When it's a BFS, we make use of Queue data structure.
'visited array' to keep track of which nodes are visited
Traverse to check whether all the nodes are visited or not. If not, return false. Else, return true.
Algorithm :
Start with room 0 which is add 0 to the queue and  mark visited[0] = 1
Now until the queue is empty


take the node from the queue
Get the adjacent nodes of the "node" and add it 
to the queue and mark it as visited.
Traverse the visited array to check whether all the nodes are visited or not.
Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {

        int n = rooms.size();

        int visited[] = new int[n];

        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

        visited[0] = 1;

        queue.add(0);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()){
            int node = queue.remove();

            for(int adj : rooms.get(node)){
                if(visited[adj]==0){
                    visited[adj] = 1;
                    queue.add(adj);
                }
            }
        }

        for(int visit : visited){
            if(visit==0)
            return false;
        }

        return true;

Understanding the Issue
The error message '%TimerTrigger%' does not resolve to a value is generated when the Azure Functions runtime cannot find a matching entry in your local.settings.json file.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency miner Diversified Energy quietly vacated a natural gas-powered crypto mining site in Elk County, Pennsylvania, reportedly leaving behind unplugged wells and regulatory violations.
The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds.¬†

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
‚ÄúThis is more than a payment solution ‚Äî it‚Äôs a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,‚Äù said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan‚Äôs tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
‚ÄúMost of the projects think, ‚ÄòOkay, we did pentests. That‚Äôs enough. Maybe bug bounty. That‚Äôs enough.‚Äô It‚Äôs not enough.‚Äù
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. 
With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
‚ÄúTesting the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,‚Äù the proposal states.¬†

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only ‚Äúviable exit‚Äù from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
