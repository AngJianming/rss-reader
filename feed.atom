The hyperlane framework natively supports the WebSocket protocol. Developers can handle WebSocket requests through a unified interface without dealing with protocol upgrades manually. This article demonstrates how to implement both point-to-point and broadcast messaging on the server side using hyperlane, along with a simple WebSocket client example.
The hyperlane framework supports the WebSocket protocol with automatic server-side protocol upgrading. It also offers features such as request middleware, routing, and response middleware.
Note: WebSocket responses must be sent using the send_response_body method. Using send_response will cause client-side parsing to fail, as it does not format the response according to the WebSocket protocol.

After a full day of frustration, I discovered that the root cause was not inside the app folder or the React components themselves, but in the configuration files for internationalization (i18n).
What happened?
Suddenly, navigation through  components was not intercepted by Next.js's router. Instead of client-side transitions, a full page reload occurred when navigating to /product/id.
No errors appeared in the console, and the app seemed to render pages normally.
Copying the whole app folder into a fresh Next.js project didn’t solve the problem.

I developed Exemplar Prompt Hub as an internal MVP/POC to streamline prompt management for my AI applications in production. It centralizes prompt storage, versioning, tagging, and retrieval via a simple REST API—perfect for chatbots, RAG systems, or prompt engineering workflows.
RESTful API for prompt CRUD operations
Version control for prompt evolution
Tag-based organization and metadata support
Powerful search and filtering capabilities
Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
PostgreSQL
FastAPI
Clone the repo and follow the README for setup.
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/prompts/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "greeting-template",
    "text": "Hello {{ name }}! Welcome to {{ platform }}. Your role is {{ role }}.",
    "description": "A greeting template with dynamic variables",
    "meta": {
      "template_variables": ["name", "platform", "role"],
      "author": "test-user"
    },
    "tags": ["template", "greeting"]
  }'

Fetch the prompt by name or ID, then render it dynamically by injecting variables:
import requests
import openai
from jinja2 import Template

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

#Fetch Prompt

# Fetch the prompt template by id
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/prompts/1")
prompt_data = response.json()

#or 

# Fetch the prompt by name
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/prompts/?skip=0&limit=1&search=greeting-template")
prompt_data = response.json()[0]

template = Template(prompt_data["text"])
rendered_prompt = template.render(
    name="John",
    platform="Exemplar Prompt Hub",
    role="Developer"
)

print(rendered_prompt)
# Output: Hello John! Welcome to Exemplar Prompt Hub. Your role is 
# Developer.

Chatbots with dynamic conversational prompts
Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems
Collaborative prompt engineering
Version-controlled prompt experimentation

Most cloud or on-prem migrations eventually land at this crossroads: Oracle to Postgres or vice versa. And when they do, you need more than just intuition — you need parameters that match up like long-lost cousins.
I have put together a handy side-by-side checklist comparing 200+ parameters across CPU, Memory, I/O, Connection Management, Autovacuuming (hello, Postgres!), PGA/SGA (hello, Oracle!), WAL vs Redo logs, and a lot more.
Whether you’re:
Migrating workloads
uning database performance
Planning cloud strategies
Or just geeking out on system parameters…
This checklist helps you decode what maps to what — because guessing shared_buffers isn’t the same as db_cache_size!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.
On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.
Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collatera…]]></summary>

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.
Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.
This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.

Short-term Bitcoin holders realized $11.6 billion in profit over the past 30 days, suggesting a potential pause or local top in the market.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market "breather."
Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,0…]]></summary>

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…]]></summary>

Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. 
Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.…]]></summary>

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $4,000.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish
Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s (ETH) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6.

According to a May 22 announcement, the DOJ unsealed charges against the 48-year-old Moscovite with a federal indictment. Gallyamov is allegedly the malware developer behind the Qakbot botnet.

Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…]]></summary>

Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.

The GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?
