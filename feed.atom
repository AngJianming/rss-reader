        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Translating PO files (Portable Object file format) is standard in the software Localization process—but if you’ve ever worked with them, you know it’s not always straightforward. 
As industry veterans, we understand how frustrating PO file translation can be: misplaced placeholders, inconsistent terminology, and clunky tools can slow down projects and create costly rework. 
As you might already know, this text-based object file format (.po) is referenced by Java programs, GNU gettext, or other software programs. PO files contain strings of language translations for user interface text. 
For an easier and faster way to translate a PO file into another language, we recommend using enterprise translation software optimized for PO files. In particular, one that will auto-translate PO file text…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In Swift, ensuring that each element in a collection has a unique identifier is crucial, especially when working with SwiftUI's ForEach loop. You might have faced a scenario where you initialize an array using a single instance of a struct multiple times, leading to duplicate identifiers. Here’s how you can tackle this problem effectively without resorting to brute force methods.
Understanding the Problem
You have a struct, CustomStruct, with a UUID as its unique identifier, and you create an array using Array(repeating:count:). This function replicates the same instance, causing all elements to share the same id. Having multiple elements with identical IDs leads to runtime errors in SwiftUI when iterating with ForEach.
Instead of manually declaring each instance, there are mo…]]></summary>

Quantum computing represents a transformative shift in the world of computation, harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that traditional computers cannot. While classical computers use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This section will explore key concepts of quantum computing, practical applications, and recent developments in the field, providing intermediate learners with a thorough understanding of this cutting-edge technology.

Secrets don’t belong in your codebase. Not in a commit, not in a PR, and definitely not in production.
And yet, it happens—a quick console.log() with an API key, a test token dropped into a config file, a placeholder password that never gets removed. Days later? Still there. Weeks? Maybe it even gets pushed to production.
I've heard more than one story of dev teams scanning older, inherited codebases—only to find hardcoded API keys sitting in plain text. These weren’t new mistakes, they’d been buried for years. It’s a reminder that even quiet, untouched code can hide serious risks.

As someone with nearly twenty years of experience, I've helped teams understand how their systems perform under pressure. I can tell you this: most load tests don’t fail because there aren’t enough users.
And one of the biggest blind spots? Compatibility.

You can run a well-designed test, simulate 10,000 users, and hit all your APIs. But you might still miss that your front-end has issues on Safari. Or, your mobile users can’t finish the checkout process. This isn’t just about performance. It’s also a compatibility problem. When you add more users, this issue becomes a performance problem.
In the early days of testing, compatibility was about making sure your layout didn’t break in Netscape. As applications changed to single-page apps, mobile-first designs, and multi-device…]]></summary>

Understanding Arc Segments in Polylines
Arc segments in a polyline can be tricky because they often include a bulge, which affects how the arc behaves in your drawings. When you convert a polyline arc segment to a standalone arc, it’s crucial to ensure that the properties (like start and end angles) are correctly calculated.
Common Problems with Arc Conversion

Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.
Qiao Wang, a core contributor to Alliance DAO, said in a May 15 X post that he may have been a victim of one of these attacks. He said a scammer notified him his Coinbase account had been compromised, asked him to verify his personal information, to which the criminals likely had access through the compromised agents, and requested he withdraw all his funds to a “Coinbase self-custodial wallet.”
“I called them out at the end of the call telling them they need to step up their game [...],” said Wang on X. “They told me that had made $7m that day.”
Cointelegraph reached out to Martin and Coinbase for comments, but had not received responses at the time of publication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks. To understand the potential impact on Bitcoin, let’s examine four key periods of significant spot ETF activity and their correlation with BTC pri…]]></summary>

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…]]></summary>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…]]></summary>

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.

On May 15, blockchain data showed that Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), into the Tron network. 
As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s. 
In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion.

“I’m seeing a lot of brands rethinking where revenue and fan engagement come from,” Kahn said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “A lot of franchises, like the ones we work with — NBA, NFL, Disney — have already had years of success with digital collection, and we’re seeing a lot of brands express interest in digital collectibles as a way to engage with fan bases at a time when physical costs are riskier and unknown.”

On this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls “Bitcoin Season 2.”

Bitcoin beyond money
“Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,” said Duke. 
“What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”
New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value.

Bitcoin’s price is retracing, but strong ETF inflows, high network activity and whale accumulation suggest BTC is on track to $140,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.9 billion in net inflows in two weeks, mirroring past rallies.

Declining exchange balances and a rising transaction volume Z-score suggest increasing overall demand.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was down 1.4% over the last 24 hours. It traded 6% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached on Jan. 20. Nevertheless, several fundamental, onchain and technical metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upside is not over.

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.
Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of reta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, was hit by a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals recruited overseas support agents to leak user data, the company said.
According to a May 15 blog post, Coinbase said a group of external actors bribed and coordinated with several customer support contractors to access internal systems and steal limited user account data.
“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” Coinbase said, adding that no passwords, private keys, funds or Coinbase Prime accounts were affected.
Less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users’ data was affected by the attack, the company said.

XRP forms a double top and rising wedge, signaling short-term downside risk toward $1.94.

NUPL indicates traders are in denial, resembling past pre-crash phases.

Long-term charts still point to bullish targets between $3.69 and $17.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in a month after forming a local low at $1.80. Improving risk appetite and prospects of an “altseason” have boosted its price.

The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants, Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.
