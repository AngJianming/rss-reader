But there's a whole world hidden behind those green and red candles... from manual chart-watchers - to machines placing thousands of orders faster than any human can set their stop-losses! This trading style is known as high-frequency trading (HFT) - and that is exactly what I'm about to explore today. 
Let's just quickly look at how different trading styles how different trading styles break down by pace and tools:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently wrote about AI and productivity, and how data from the 2024 Accelerate State of DevOps Report shows that widespread AI adoption in the software industry is contributing to a real and meaningful decline in software delivery performance. Approximately 76% of developers use AI tools in daily tasks such as coding, debugging, and documentation.
This week I posted a silly and whimsical post on Bluesky, which seemed to resonate with a lot of you out there, and it reminded me of a section in the DORA report about valuable work.

AI has always promised to “help people spend more time doing valuable work” by “automating the manual, repetitive, toilsome tasks” so that software developers can be “free to use their time on ‘something better.’” Despite this, the report states that “individual…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were working on the Intro to Open Source course, one of the biggest painpoints we noted with new contributors was the frustration they felt when their PRs weren’t merged in in what they felt was a reasonable amount of time. They had done their research, found an issue, gotten assigned, and then…nothing. No feedback. No merge. Just silence.
It’s a familiar story. I’ve had contributors tell me, “My PR has been sitting there for two weeks and I haven’t heard a thing.” And I get it. There are so many reasons this happens, including burnout, abandoned projects, the lottery factor, and it’s rarely about bad intentions. That’s why I always tell contributors to join the community before contributing. It helps you understand the project’s rhythms, how to communicate with maintainers, and wh…]]></summary>

Despite coding in JavaScript and React for years, I sometimes feel like I know everything and nothing all at once. This peculiar feeling intensifies whenever there’s a new JavaScript framework release or a major update in my tech stack. I remember the confusion (and excitement) when React introduced hooks after I’d just gotten comfortable with class components, or when Next.js switched to the App Router from Pages directory.
What I’ve realized is that the tech world is always evolving, and you never truly know "everything." But that’s also what makes it engaging. To overcome imposter syndrome, I make it a point to build projects with any tech stack I have doubts about. Additionally, I create tut…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pandemic Studios quietly kicked off Battlefront 3 development right after Battlefront II’s DLC dropped, dreaming up epic space-to-ground battles that blended dogfights and infantry combat on massive maps. Unfortunately, LucasArts insisted on a one-year turnaround just as the team was learning the ropes of Xbox 360/PS3 hardware, so negotiations stalled and the project barely left the launchpad.
LucasArts then handed the sequel to Free Radical Design (which got it to about 95% before it too was canned), Pandemic folded in 2009, and a true Battlefront 3 never saw the light of day. EA’s 2017 Battlefront II lives on, but the original trilogy remains unfinished.]]></summary>

That tougher design journey paid off, giving BG3 the visual weight that helped fuel its huge success.
Now, with two new Larian projects in the early storytelling phase (and whispers of a Divinity sequel), here’s hoping one of them finally embraces that fun, exaggerated cartoon style we almost got – I’m here for both!]]></summary>

Battlefront 2’s launch was rocky thanks to microtransactions so brutal that unlocking a single hero could take around 40 hours of grind.
