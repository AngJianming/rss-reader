        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since mid-March, I’ve been building something called Sigil. It’s not just a framework or another AI wrapper—it’s an attempt to give structure to trust. To let code make decisions and be held accountable for them. Not in the buzzwordy “ethical AI” sense. I mean literal, cryptographically enforced accountability.
Verifiable memory.

Mutations that leave a trace.

Systems that can explain why they did what they did—because that’s the point.
And I’ve been doing it solo.
Most days, I’m on it constantly. Reading. Writing. Designing. Debugging. Thinking five moves ahead and five years back. But as of May 19th, I haven’t touched a single line of new code.
Not because I burned out.

Not because I hit a wall.

Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said.

In this post, I’ll walk you through a simple, local-only solution to automatically run Laravel migrations right after you run git pull. No CI/CD, no shell scripts — just a smart git alias.
In our team, we often push updates that include database migrations. For example:
I work on a feature and create a new migration.
After testing, I push it to GitHub.
My teammate pulls the latest code for code review.

At first glance, they seem pretty similar—both let you work with a set of items in a read-only way. So when should you use each? In this post, I’ll break down the differences, show real-world use cases, and give you code samples so you know exactly when to reach for one or the other.
IEnumerable<T>
The simplest way to represent a sequence of items that you can iterate over (with foreach). It doesn’t let you access by index or get the count directly.
IReadOnlyList<T>
Represents a read-only list of items. You can access items by index and get the number of items, but you can’t change the collection.

Rust is often praised for its memory safety guarantees and low-level performance, but one of the concepts that initially leaves many developers scratching their heads is lifetimes. If you're here, you're likely grappling with lifetimes and perhaps wondering why Rust makes you explicitly annotate them in certain contexts.
In this post, I'll help demystify lifetimes by breaking them down into simple, digestible concepts. We'll use a real-world analogy to make it stick, build up from an easy code example, and explore how lifetimes help Rust ensure memory safety. By the end of this article, you'll not only understand what lifetimes are, but why they exist and how to work with them confidently.

I created a fake startup — Whispr — that offers “Silence-as-a-Service.”
Neural Quietude Index™ and Void Engagement Coefficient.
Zenith Voidwalker.
Let’s be honest: most of us in tech don’t talk to each other, we communicate via tooling.
So I asked:
What happens if we remove all communication and pretend that’s an upgrade?
“The OS of Nonverbal Presence.”
Whispr is a fully silent productivity platform.
The branding is pure Silicon Valley:
Jargonized fake metrics ✅
Monospace font and sacred geometry ✅
A tagline that feels like it could be AI-generated or Buddhist ✅
🔗 You can experience the void here
People started asking for the SDK.
One VC asked if it was invite-only.
A designer offered to “collab on the brand strategy of the void.”
The fun part?
believable it became.
Modern dev culture has over-optimized for:
Articulating ideas
Framing narratives
Over-documenting “value”
We don’t build products.
performance rituals of doing work.
Whispr isn’t satire — it’s just... slightly ahead.
Whispr exposes how much of work is social positioning:
Saying “let’s circle back” instead of “I don’t know”
Writing strategy docs that no one reads
Designing decks to impress other decks
Silence removed all that.
Good satire should feel plausible to those it mocks.
Tech loves mysticism when it’s dressed in metrics.
If you make your BS beautiful enough, someone will fund it.
Whispr was never about silence.
techno-rituals we mistake for clarity.
In pretending to launch a joke, I accidentally diagnosed a condition.
“Whispr changed nothing. That was the point.”

The map is based on the Leaflet module, which is entirely open-source and free. It can pull imagery from any source, so I chose OpenStreetMap, since it is also free.
In order to give visitors a true-to-scale overview of the farm's layout, I overlayed markers, zones, and paths on the map based on real coordinates.

Most icons are stored on the server as SVGs, and then processed through a custom "icon factory" when they are needed. This makes it easy to add new icons, and reuse existing ones.
The map has been made interactive by allowing certain elements to be clicked on, which will reveal a 'popup' with more content.


Utilizing the JS navigator.geolocation API, I implemented a simple geolocation feature that refreshes every 8 seconds. Users can click the GPS button to center the map on their location.

In order to reduce crowding and maintain the aesthetic appeal of the map, some icons and tooltips will disappear when zoomed out to certain levels.
Additionally, zooming has been limited to level 16, and capped at level 19, since that is the maximum level OpenStreetMap will provide tiles for.

This feature fully incorporates the map with the rest of the website. I've made a lightweight system that allows linking to specific coordinates via the URL query.
This will enable visitors to be pointed directly to the location they're looking for without pouring over the map.]]></summary>

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

While methodologies like BEM and preprocessors like Sass previously dominated, today more and more teams are transitioning to the utility-first approach embodied in Tailwind CSS. This framework has fundamentally changed the perception of how CSS architecture should look in modern applications.
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes for building custom user interfaces. Unlike component frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma, Tailwind doesn't offer ready-made components but provides tools for creating them.
The core philosophy of Tailwind is that instead of writing custom CSS, you combine small, reusable utility classes directly in your HTML markup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signaled support for a bill recently passed by the state House of Representatives that would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.
In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.
Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.
This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.

In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. 
Under the emoluments clause, a US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress. Bloomberg reported that a majority of the attendees at the memecoin dinner were likely forei…]]></summary>

Short-term Bitcoin holders realized $11.6 billion in profit over the past 30 days, suggesting a potential pause or local top in the market.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market "breather."
Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,0…]]></summary>

Bitcoin slipped below $109,588, but technical charts suggest traders are buying each dip.

Excessive leverage in Bitcoin futures increases the risk of a quick correction.

Select altcoins have turned down from their respective overhead resistance levels, signaling that the bears remain sellers on rallies.

Sellers have pulled Bitcoin (BTC) back below the breakout level of $109,588, but lower levels are likely to attract buyers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web3 developer platform Alchemy has acquired HeyMint, a California-based non-fungible token (NFT) launchpad, in a move designed to enhance the company’s smart wallet infrastructure. 
The undisclosed funding deal will see HeyMint’s infrastructure embedded within Alchemy as it seeks to simplify user onboarding for Web3 applications, the company disclosed on May 23. HeyMint’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Flor Ronsmans De Vry, joins Alchemy as part of the deal. 
While not a household name in crypto, HeyMint attracted more than 1 million users over its first two years of operations. It was the launchpad behind $38 million in NFT sales and supported the Web3 efforts of major brands, including The Sandbox, Universal Music Group and Ubisoft. 
In 2023, HeyMint facilitated NFT sales for …]]></summary>

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…]]></summary>

Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $4,000.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish
Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s (ETH) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6.

On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.
Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…]]></summary>

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?

In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. 
“This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. 
Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.

In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals. It follows Genius Group being temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order had banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more BTC.
Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.
