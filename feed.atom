        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Triage Meaning in Software
The main goal is to ensure that the most critical defects are addressed promptly while deferring or even rejecting low-impact issues that don’t threaten the product’s stability or customer satisfaction.
Why Do You Need a Defect Triage?
Efficient Use of Resources: Focus development and testing efforts on defects that truly matter.
Better Decision Making: Enables data-driven discussions about whether to fix, defer, or reject a defect.
Improved Communication: Aligns all stakeholders on defect status and resolution plans.
Quality Control: Helps maintain a healthy and manageable defect backlog.
How Often Should You Have Defect Triage?
Daily during active development or release cycles.
The Defect Triage Meeting
Review new and existing defects.
Defect Triage Process
Gather Defects: Collect all open or newly reported defects since the last triage.
Review & Clarify: Ensure all bugs have complete, understandable, and reproducible steps.
Assess Severity & Priority: Classify based on business impact and urgency.
Assign Ownership: Designate responsible developers or teams.
Set Resolution Plan: Define when and how the bug should be addressed (fix immediately, delay, or reject).
Challenges with Defect Triaging
Subjectivity: Different stakeholders may have conflicting views on a bug’s severity.
Volume Overload: Too many bugs can overwhelm the team and delay decisions.
Incomplete Information: Poorly reported bugs slow down the triage process.
Lack of Accountability: Unclear ownership can result in unresolved or orphaned defects.
Time Constraints: In fast-paced sprints, teams may skip triage, leading to chaos later.
Thumb Rules in Bug Triage
Fix high-severity and high-priority bugs first.
Conclusion
By incorporating intelligent platforms like GenQE.ai, teams can elevate their defect triage process with automation, pattern recognition, and smart prioritization, making software testing more efficient and outcomes more predictable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coroutine - Kotlin



A coroutine is a programming construct that allows a function to suspend its execution and resume it later, enabling cooperative multitasking and asynchronous programming
Coroutines don't preemptively switch between tasks; they voluntarily yield control (suspend) to allow other tasks to run. 
This cooperative nature enables coroutines to perform tasks without blocking the main thread or other operations, making them suitable for UI-related tasks and I/O operations. 
Coroutines maintain their state between suspensions, allowing them to resume where they left off.
Coroutines use special keywords or mechanisms (like await in Python or yield in Unity) to suspend their execution and resume later when needed.
Coroutines provide a cleaner and more readable way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callbacks or promises. 
Coroutines can help organize complex asynchronous logic, making it easier to understand and maintain. 
Coroutines are lightweight and don't require the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads. 
In some cases, coroutines can provide the illusion of concurrency without the need for actual threads, improving efficiency.
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    println("Main starts: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

    // Launching a coroutine
    val job = launch {
        delay(1000) // Non-blocking delay (suspends coroutine)
        println("Coroutine says hello from: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
    }

    println("Main continues...")
    job.join() // Wait for the coroutine to finish

    println("Main ends: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")

Acting like an "invisibility cloak" and a "master key" in the online world, they unlock numerous possibilities. Let’s delve into this seemingly mysterious yet highly practical technology and explore how it quietly transforms our internet experience.
Simply put, an IP proxy is like a diligent mail carrier. When you want to send a letter to a friend, you don’t deliver it directly—instead, you go through a post office. An IP proxy is that "post office," receiving your online requests, forwarding them under its own identity, and then returning the results to you. This process masks your real IP address, keeping your true online identity hidden.
Guardian of Privacy Protection
IPPeak stands out as an excellent choice.
IP proxies have grown from mere technical tools into vital bridges for the free flow of information. Whether for individual users or organizations, leveraging this tool wisely can significantly enhance online experiences and business advantages. The key lies in finding the right balance—maximizing its benefits while adhering to responsible usage principles.

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…]]></summary>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…]]></summary>
