hello people today was my last ete for 1st year of btech. after the result i would be a 2nd year student. after the exam that i helped moma with her work. then came big sister's result and i got into a fight with sissy (totally her fault) i have decided to learn c++ during this summer vacation. lpu has also started a compulsory community development project for passing 1st year students. i couldn't find any close ngo near me but then i saw an announcement that lpu has colaborated with wns care foundation for this cdp. so atleast i know that i would be working with them. i can just pay another ngo 2k and get the certificate but what about geo-photos capturing my contribution?
so i going to save money and work harder for this because as far as i know  that cdp is worth two credits. i am also planning to cover java because last time learning c programing was worth it.
yesterday evening i posted a certificate on linkedin about my 72 hour course on c programming and a son of moma's friend, my senior, who has given me tutions in 7th, im writing the messages here so i dont forget it.
I see tum coding pe focus kree ho kafi, so kuch suggestion hai
Competitive coding ki practice kro help milegi bahut
Geeks for Geeks, codechef, leetcode ache platforms hai
Gfg pe to tumko content bi mil jaega pdne ke kiye
sth sth daily aptitude ke kuch questions kra kro taki practice me rhoge
abi se shuru krdo placement tk bdya setup ho jaega
Good and hackerrank and hackerearth pe companies ke coding test bi hote hain, to tum off campus bi apply kr skte whn se
Amazon ka ek women wala program hota hai usko check Krna off campus ka
I hope ye suggestions help krenge tumko, have a good day ahead...
thats all for today
signing off.]]></summary>

I’ve tried Microsoft OneNote multiple times in the past — and each time, I gave up. It felt overwhelming, messy, and just… too much.
But recently, I tried something different: instead of expecting to master it in one go, I gave myself permission to start slow — step by step. That one mindset shift changed everything.
In this post, I’ll show you a simple system I now use to take notes in OneNote without ever feeling lost. If you're a student, developer, or just someone trying to organize your learning — this steady start is for you.
Understanding the OneNote Structure


To make the most of OneNote, you need to understand its basic hierarchy:

AVERAGE: Similar to the SUM function, the AVERAGE function calculates the mean of the values of a range of cells. For example: =AVERAGE (A1:A17).
IF: With the IF function, you can ask Excel to return values based on a logical test. The syntax looks like: IF(logical test, value_if_true, [value_if_false]). For example: =IF(A1>B1,”Over Budget”,”OK”).]]></summary>

As applications grow in complexity, distributed architectures become the norm, and user expectations for always-on services climb, the ability of a system to withstand unexpected failures is paramount. This is where Chaos Engineering, the practice of intentionally injecting faults into a system to uncover weaknesses, has proven invaluable. Traditionally, chaos experiments were often conducted in production environments, a reactive measure to validate resilience in a live setting.

Application development is hard. Every platform has its own quirks, dependencies, and UI paradigms.
