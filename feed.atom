Hey everyone!
I’m super excited to share a small yet proud achievement of mine — I’ve created and deployed my very own portfolio website using just HTML and CSS! 🎨💻
This marks the beginning of my journey into the world of web development, and I couldn’t be more thrilled. As someone who's passionate about learning and building new skills, this was a great hands-on experience for me.
What I Built 🛠️
A simple, clean portfolio page that introduces who I am.
Sections for About Me, Projects, and Contact Info.
Designed using only HTML and CSS, focusing on layout, colors, and responsiveness.
Where It's Live 🌍
I chose GitLab Pages for deployment — and guess what? It was easier than I expected! Just a few steps to push my code and boom — it’s live! ✨
Check it out here! (https://gitlab.com/full-stack-developer1812/front-end)
What I Learned 📚
How to structure a basic HTML document
Styling with CSS to make things visually appealing
Deploying a static website on GitLab
A boost of confidence in my learning path!
What’s Next? 🔜
This is just the beginning! I’m planning to explore JavaScript, get into responsive design, and build even more interactive websites. Eventually, I want to become a full-fledged web developer.
Thanks for reading! Feel free to share your thoughts or tips — I’m all ears! 🧠
Keep learning and keep building]]></summary>

If you’ve written a Go program to find the smallest number in a list but are puzzled by how it works, you’re not alone! Many newcomers to Go and programming, in general, encounter similar confusion. Let’s break down the code snippet you provided to understand how it functions, its logic, and why it outputs the smallest number correctly.
The Code Explained
Here's your Go code snippet:
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := []int{
        48, 96, 86, 68,
        57, 82, 63, 70,
        37, 34, 83, 27,
        19, 97, 9, 17,
    }

    for i, num := range x {

Today’s apps aren’t just running on one server—they’re distributed, containerized, and often spread across multiple clouds. That flexibility is great, but it also means more ways for things to go wrong.
As companies ramp up cloud-native and AI workloads, keeping security in sync with fast-moving development cycles gets tricky. That’s where DevSecOps comes in. It weaves security right into DevOps workflows—so teams can catch issues early, stay compliant, and move fast without cutting corners.

In this blog, we’ll explore why knowing your audience matters more than your design, and how that knowledge helps you build a website that actually works.
Yes, a clean and professional design makes a good first impression. But think about this: how many times have you visited a good-looking website and left because it didn’t have what you were looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Hey fellas 
I mean, it’s everywhere.
Well today, we’re going to understand that what is JSON actually , why it’s so popular, and where it's used.
Let’s get started!
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It’s a lightweight format used to store and exchange data.
A simple format that computers and humans can both read easily.
{
  "name": "Selfish Dev",
  "gender": "male",
  "isGameDev": true,
  "tools": ["Godot", "Aseprite"]
}

That right there is a JSON object.
It uses key-value pairs (like name: "Selfish Dev")
Keys are always in quotes
Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other JSON objects
And that's what JSON is.
APIs(REST, GraphQL responses)


Configuration files (e.g., package.json in Node.js)


Storing structured data (NoSQL databases like MongoDB)


Data exchange between frontend & backend




  
  
  How to Use JSON in JavaScript:




Parse JSON string → Object:




const jsonString = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // Output: "Selfish"

Parse Object → JSON string :




const user = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString); // Output: '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}'

JSON is a fundamental tool in modern web development due to its simplicity and versatility.

Till then stay curios and stay selfish]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently working on a small project in Python. During this process I have learned a lot and also discovered many problems, such as:
  (All the following questions are just my personal opinions, and everyone is welcome to give me suggestions.)
  First, for beginners, is the local configuration of various databases (MySQL is used as an example here) too complicated? And various unpredictable errors may occur in this process.
  Secondly, after the developer configures the database on the local computer, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax (for example, after the developer configures MySQL, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax). Of course, learning SQL syntax is very necessary for programming developers. However, for a developer who wants to quickly experience or quickly develop a web application, spending time learning SQL (if he has not learned SQL) will reduce his development efficiency and desire to learn.
  Also, when the developer has configured SQL on his computer and learned SQL syntax, but when he wants to use it, it is better to call MySQL through python. At this time, he needs to use a third-party library like pymysql to call MySQL through the third-party library, but this may result in a series of errors.
  Finally, if you overcome the difficulties mentioned above and some difficulties that have not been mentioned, you will find that for developing a small project, developers will only use a small part of MySQL's functions, or even only some extremely simple functions such as query, delete, modify and insert.]]></summary>

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.”

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI decentralized apps (DApps) have seen a spike in user activity and could soon challenge gaming and DeFi for the top spot in the DApp ecosystem, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows.
“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. 
“If this trend continues, AI could soon challenge the traditional dominance of DeFi and Gaming, signaling a new era in the DApp landscape.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly working on its own microchips across multiple product categories, including smart glasses and artificial intelligence — a hint at what’s next for the massive Silicon Valley-based tech giant. 
A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.
The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said. 
Apple’s smart glasses will initially be non-augmented reality…]]></summary>

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tech company Meta is reportedly exploring integrating stablecoin payments into its platforms after a three-year hiatus from cryptocurrencies, Fortune reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
"Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump was reportedly manipulated by a lobbyist tied to Ripple Labs into announcing the XRP (XRP) token would be part of his plans for a national cryptocurrency reserve.
According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. 
“People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the …]]></summary>

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.
