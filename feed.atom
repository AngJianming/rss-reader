But over time, I realized that coding alone isn't enough.
My goal with this account is to better present and share the projects I'm working on, such as Gland, TDQ, Qiks, and smaller packages like emitter.
Like many others, I hope LinkedIn can be a space to connect with other developers, discover people with similar interests, and maybe even explore new opportunities along the way.
If you’ve used LinkedIn professionally, I’d love to hear your experience—how do you use it? Has it helped you in your career? What made it valuable for you?

Las capas de cascada (cascade layers) en CSS han sido introducidas para resolver uno de los problemas más complejos y persistentes en la escritura de estilos: los conflictos de especificidad. En este artículo exploraremos cuál es exactamente ese problema y cómo la regla @layer nos ofrece una solución eficaz y moderna.
La regla @layer permite declarar estas capas de cascada, que funcionan de forma análoga a las capas en editores gráficos como Photoshop o GIMP: cada capa es un grupo independiente, pero en lugar de imágenes, gestionamos reglas CSS.
El objetivo principal es claro:
Organizar mejor el código.


Evitar los problemas clásicos de especificidad.


Reducir la necesidad de usar !important o sobreescribir selectores complejos.

Os tipos primitivos são predefinidos (já definidos) em Java. Tipos não primitivos são criados pelo programador e não são definidos.
Tipos não primitivos podem ser usados para chamar métodos para realizar determinadas operações, enquanto tipos primitivos não podem.
Um tipo primitivo sempre tem um valor, enquanto os tipos não primitivos podem ser null.

Upgrading your Mac from Sierra to High Sierra can occasionally lead to unexpected behavior, such as the notorious setlocale warning when using Terminal SSH to connect to CentOS systems. This unfortunate issue primarily stems from discrepancies in locale environment variables and normalization processes between different operating systems. Let's dive into the reasons behind this warning and how you can resolve it effectively.
What Causes the setlocale Warning?
The setlocale warning occurs due to improper locale settings in your environment. When you connect via SSH to a CentOS server (whether version 6 or 7), it checks the locale variables you've set. If these settings do not conform to expected formats, you may see warnings that can disrupt your terminal experience.

It’s not all sunshine, though: the setup looks a bit dorky, only works on select Intel CPUs for now, saps battery life in a hurry and the glasses’ field of view could be wider.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.

The ETP is listed on Euronext’s Paris and Amsterdam exchanges, 21Shares said in a May 6 announcement. 
Cronos (CRO) is a layer-1 blockchain network affiliated with Crypto.com, a centralized exchange.

The ETP aims to provide investors with a “straightforward way to integrate CRO into their portfolios through traditional banks and brokers, eliminating the need to directly handle digital wallets or exchanges,” 21Shares said.

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to US President Donald Trump’s “ownership of crypto” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Petr Kozyakov, CEO of crypto payments platform Mercuryo, told Cointelegraph that the future of finance may not be a winner-takes-all scenario but a blend of digital assets and fiat, each used where it makes the most sense. 
In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

Turner, who has spent over 20 years at the IRS and most recently served as a senior adviser within the Digital Assets Office, will now head the unit, according to a report from Bloomberg Tax citing a person familiar with the situation.
Her promotion marks a significant leadership transition at a time when US crypto tax enforcement is facing both internal and external pressures.
On May 5, Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, two private-sector experts brought in to lead the IRS’s crypto unit, exited after roughly a year in their roles.

In a Cointelegraph interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh warned that while tokenization is promising, projects must “clearly demonstrate” the benefits of tokenizing specific assets. 
“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 
If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will …]]></summary>
