‚ÄúWe have every expectation now that it‚Äôs going to pass,‚Äù Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger ‚Äútrillions of dollars‚Äù in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently acquired Netatmo smart radiator valves to manage my rooms' temperature remotely. I'm not skilled at manual tasks, but I could easily replace the old thermo-static valves. I then registered the smart ones in the Netatmo app. Finally, I integrated them in my Home Assistant via the dedicated Netatmo integration. Everything was very straightforward.
I noticed that each valve not only allows remote control but also offers a state with several attributes. I wanted to extract the room's temperature indicator from it. It was not as easy as I thought it was, so I want to describe how I managed to achieve it.
By default, the Netatmo valve displays a multi-valued state. To check, go to the Developer Tools > States menu. You can use a filter to find the device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manufacturing has always been a complex balancing act‚Äîmanaging cost, quality, efficiency, and supply chains. Today, predictive analytics is helping manufacturers achieve that balance more effectively by unlocking insights hidden in their data.
Whether it‚Äôs preventing machinery breakdowns or improving production schedules, predictive analytics is making manufacturing smarter and more efficient.
In short, it‚Äôs the use of data models to forecast events before they happen. It goes beyond traditional reporting and dashboards by leveraging AI/ML algorithms to suggest proactive actions.
Examples include:
Predicting machine failures before they occur
Forecasting customer demand
Identifying quality issues early in the line
Anticipating supply chain disruptions
Predictive Maintenance:
Algorithms detect patterns that typically precede defects‚Äîhelping teams intervene before waste occurs.
By predicting demand accurately, manufacturers can keep optimal inventory levels and reduce carrying costs.
Some manufacturers use analytics to monitor energy usage and forecast high-consumption periods, enabling cost-saving actions.
Data Collection: IoT sensors, machine logs, ERP data
Data Processing: ETL pipelines, cloud-based data lakes
Modeling: Python, R, TensorFlow, Azure ML
Deployment: Real-time dashboards, API endpoints, embedded analytics
You don‚Äôt need to boil the ocean‚Äîstart with a single problem area like downtime or product defects and iterate.
With tight margins and high customer expectations, manufacturers can't afford reactive strategies. Predictive analytics provides a strategic edge by reducing waste, improving efficiency, and driving innovation.

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity.¬†
But what‚Äôs the goal?¬†
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It‚Äôs not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform‚Äôs creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly ‚Äúdiverted and misappropriated millions of dollars‚Äô worth‚Äù of SafeMoon‚Äôs SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony‚Äôs trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin‚Äôs $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Democratic leaning organizations and members of Congress have announced plans to protest what they describe as the sale of access to the office of the US president, in reference to Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin dinner on May 22. The event‚Äôs attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.
Since Trump‚Äôs memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption. 
The memecoin dinner prompted some Democratic lawmakers to withdraw support for crypto-related legislation in Congress, includi‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21, a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto.
SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state‚Äôs comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle ‚Äî a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 ‚Äî a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl‚Ä¶]]></summary>
