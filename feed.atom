But here’s the truth: if you want better opportunities, better projects, and more control over your career—you need to sell yourself. And that starts with a personal brand.
You might think “branding” is just for influencers and startups. Not true. As a developer, your brand is your reputation made visible.
Here’s how to build it, own it, and let it open doors.

Before you can create a personal brand, you need clarity. Ask yourself:

While AI powers chatbots, image generators, and recommendation engines, it remains narrow—trained for specific tasks. AGI, by contrast, refers to a still-hypothetical system capable of understanding and performing any intellectual task a human can. Yet despite growing attention, AGI has no single agreed-upon definition. What exactly qualifies as “general” intelligence? And how close are we to achieving it? Below are some influential quotes that attempt to define what AGI really means.

Hoy quiero hablar de un tema muy importante, que no puede faltar en un desarrollo serio de software: las pruebas unitarias.
Las pruebas unitarias son código que escribimos para validar la lógica de nuestro programa. Estas pruebas se caracterizan por evaluar partes pequeñas del código, como una función o una clase.
Además, las pruebas unitarias son muy útiles para realizar refactorizaciones a futuro sin temor a que, durante este proceso, deje de funcionar lo que ya teníamos correctamente.
Y es que, en realidad, creo que todos hemos trabajado en algún proyecto donde el equipo tiene miedo de modificar ciertas partes del código, porque no sabemos si lo que vamos a cambiar afectará reglas de negocio ya implementadas, provocando comportamientos extraños y los te…]]></summary>

These evolutions can come in the following forms:
Changing the system prompt to try to improve performance or resolve issues
Adding new tools for AI systems to call in function-calling scenarios. This is particularly relevant when working with tooling like Semantic Kernel or Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Changing the data that is accessible to models for Retrieval Augmentation Generation. This often comes naturally over time as new data is added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears.

Bitcoin could turn parabolic if prices move above $115,000 to liquidate more than $7 billion in short positions.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit taking from BTC investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>

The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.
