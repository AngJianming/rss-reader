        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

APIs have become the lifeblood of modern digital ecosystems. Ensuring scalability, fairness, and resilience is no longer optional—it’s fundamental. Traditional rate limiting techniques offer a static shield against abuse and overload, but they can fall short when faced with dynamic, ever-shifting workloads. Inspired by the adaptive system design strategies from Alex Xu’s acclaimed System Design Interview series, this article explores a powerful, nuanced alternative: building adaptive rate limiters using AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). We delve into how AIMD works, why Redis is an ideal backend, and provide a full C# implementation to empower developers building the next generation of cloud-native APIs.

We are working with a Java program that identifies duplicate entries in a list and organizes their respective information.

If you've used LangChain, you already know the idea of "chaining logical steps" in LLM workflows. SynTeam Framework brings a structural alternative: a lightweight, JSON-based templating system that defines Units (roles), Tasks (execution order), and Operators (data routing) – all optimized for prompt-native environments like ChatGPT.
Unlike LangChain’s Python-centric abstraction, SynTeam templates run entirely within the LLM context, allowing you to:
Design execution flows without writing code
Assign responsibility explicitly to each processing block
Keep your logic transparent and reproducible inside the LLM session itself
This post is for developers, LLM engineers, and technical architects who want structure and predictability without external libraries.

I've always been curious about how most of the technologies I use on a day-to-day basis work. One of the things we as programmers have to interact with daily is HTTP servers. Most of the time, we don't think much about it since HTTP has been around for a long time, and there are thousands of HTTP servers and clients, so most people don't give much thought to how these technologies work!
As someone who worked on many web-based applications and built many restful APIs, I would like to think that I have a pretty good understanding of how the HTTP protocol works and how HTTP servers generally function, however, since I've always been using ready-made HTTP servers (Mostly Kesterl, IIS and Nginx) and HTTP clients (curl, postman, httpie) I felt that there's a lot that I can learn …]]></summary>

  Problem:


You are given an n x n square matrix. Write a function is_toeplitz(matrix) that checks whether the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix.
A Toeplitz matrix is one where every descending diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (↘️) contains the same elements.
Consider this matrix:
6 7 8
4 6 7
1 4 6

The diagonals are:
[1],
[4, 4],
[6, 6, 6],
[7, 7],
[8]
All elements in each diagonal are equal — so this is a Toeplitz matrix ✅.
To check if a matrix is Toeplitz:
Loop through each element in the matrix (excluding the last row and column).
For each element, compare it with the one diagonally down-right from it.
If any of those pairs don’t match, return False.
If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.
from typing import List

def is_toeplitz(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(matrix)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i + 1 < n and j + 1 < n:
                if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i + 1][j + 1]:
                    return False

    return True

matrix = [
    [6, 7, 8],
    [4, 6, 7],
    [1, 4, 6]

The problem isn't that your idea sucks.

MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, a term popularized by Eric Ries in The Lean Startup. It was meant to encourage founders to avoid wasting months or years building features nobody wanted.
But over time, people twisted the idea.
Now "MVP" gets tossed around as a free pass to cut every corner:
Sloppy UX
No feedback loop
Buggy core flows
All under the excuse of "we'll improve it later."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bybit exchange has recovered its liquidity to pre-hack levels just 30 days following the February 2025 attack that drained nearly $1.5 billion in funds.
According to a report from crypto research and analytics firm Kaiko, Bitcoin's (BTC) 1% market depth, a measure of liquidity, returned to pre-hack levels of around $13 million per day in March 2025.

Altcoin liquidity levels on the exchange have been slower to recover than Bitcoin but have rebounded to around 80% of the pre-hack levels. The authors of the Kaiko report added:
"This lag is largely due to the risk-off market environment, which has impacted altcoins more severely. While Bitcoin is still seen as a risky asset, it remains the crypto market’s safe h…]]></summary>

According to a May 7 Bloomberg report based on an analysis of the top TRUMP tokenholders, 19 of the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard used foreign exchanges that exclude US-based customers, suggesting either foreign nationals or Americans living abroad. In addition, more than half of the top 220 holders — the group eligible to apply for a dinner with the president — also used exchanges in other countries.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japan’s Metaplanet purchased an additional 555 Bitcoin as part of its aggressive accumulation strategy, bringing its total holdings to 5,555 BTC, valued at over $536 million at current prices.
On May 7, the Tokyo-listed firm disclosed that it spent $53.4 million acquiring 555 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $96,134. The company now holds 5,555 BTC, purchased for $481.5 million at an average price of $86,672 per Bitcoin, according to CEO Simon Gerovich.
The company also announced the issuance of another $25 million in zero-coupon ordinary bonds to fund its ongoing BTC buys. Since early 2024, the firm has raised over 35 billion yen ($244 million) through zero-coupon bonds and stock acquisition rights via its partner, Evo Fund.

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen 16 days of inflows for the spot BTC ETF, with a further 280 Bitcoin (BTC) or around $36 million piling into the fund on May 6, according to HODL15Capital.  
The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added. 
“IBIT alone has done this in a few weeks, more than a year after launch.”
