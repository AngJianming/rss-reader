CSS positioning is a powerful tool that allows developers to control the layout of web elements with precision. Among the various positioning methods, absolute positioning stands out for its flexibility in placing elements anywhere on a web page. In this article, we'll delve into absolute positioning, exploring its properties, behavior, and practical applications with detailed examples.
Understanding Absolute Positioning
Absolute positioning enables us to place elements precisely on the page, independent of the normal document flow. When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal flow of the document, meaning it no longer affects the layout of surrounding elements. This unique behavior allows the element to overlap with other elements and be positioned …]]></summary>

Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
Public IPs are worldwide unique and routable on the internet. Any device directly connected to the internet (such as your router) will have a public IP. When you open a website or email, your public IP is used to address your network on the internet.
These addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocks allocated by regional internet registries (RIRs), which are overseen by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
Class D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
✔ Private IPs are used in internal networks
Public: For sale
Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), also known as Large-Scale NAT (LSN), is a network address translation (NAT) technique used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to mitigate the ongoing exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.
CGNAT acts as an intermediary layer of NAT at the ISP level, allowing multiple customers to share a single public IPv4 address. Think of it like this:
Traditional NAT (your home router): Your home router takes all the private IP addresses of devices within your home network (e.g., 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3) and translates them to a single public IP address that your ISP assigns to your router.
CGNAT (ISP level): CGNAT goes a step further. It takes the "public" IP address that your home router receives (which, in a CGNAT setup, is a private IP address from the ISP's internal network) and translates it, along with the "private" IPs of hundreds or even thousands of other customers, to a single public IP address that is then used to access the internet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey problem solvers! 🎯
Today we’re tackling a fun and elegant problem from LeetCode — 3423: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array. This one checks your understanding of array boundaries and circular behavior. Let’s break it down. 🔍
You're given a circular array nums, and your task is to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, where:
The first and last elements are also considered adjacent (because it's circular).
You return the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers.
Input: nums = [1, 2, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
|1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 4| = 2, |4 - 1| = 3.
3.
The array is circular, so both regular adjacent pairs and the pair between the last and first element must be considered.
Initialize ans with |nums[0] - nums[n-1]|.
Iterate through the array and compute |nums[i] - nums[i+1]| for all valid i.
Return the maximum of all these values.
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxAdjacentDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
    int ans = abs(nums.front() - nums.back());

    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i)
      ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));

    return ans;
  }
};

var maxAdjacentDistance = function(nums) {
    let ans = Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[nums.length - 1]);

    for (let i = 0; i + 1 < nums.length; ++i) {
        ans = Math.max(ans, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));
    }

    return ans;
};

def maxAdjacentDistance(nums):
    ans = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])

    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))

    return ans

Input: nums = [1, 2, 4]
Output: 3

Input: nums = [-5, -10, -5]
Output: 5

Input: nums = [0, 100, -100]
Output: 200

Time Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array
Space Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space

This is a great warm-up problem to train your attention to edge conditions like circular connections. Simple logic and clean implementation go a long way here.
