Sharing my honest experience with mental overload and simple changes that helped me reset.
As a self-taught frontend developer, staying focused is one of the hardest parts of the journey.

It's not just the learning curve. It's the distractions, the pressure, and the never-ending voice that says, "You're not doing enough."
In this post, I want to be honest about how I’ve struggled with focus — and what small things started to help.
I used to think lack of focus meant lack of willpower.

So I tried forcing myself into 10-hour days, strict Pomodoro timers, “no phone” blocks.

None of it worked long-term.
The real issue? My mind was overloaded.
Too many open tabs

Too many unfinished tutorials

Too much comparison

Too little rest
Every morning, I write one single task that matters most.

Not 5 goals. Not a long list. Just one.
If I finish it, I win the day.
I started working from one place only — clean, distraction-free.

Phone stays in another room. Browser has only 1–2 tabs open max.

Even switching to a different desk helped.
When I felt burned out, I used to scroll social media.

Now I walk — even just 10 minutes. No headphones. No thinking. Just walk.
It resets my brain better than anything else.
I stopped waiting to "feel perfect" to code, to write, to publish.

Now I celebrate done work. A small feature. A commit. A published post.
Done > Perfect.
If you’re struggling to focus — you’re not alone.

This isn't about being lazy. It’s about being human, overwhelmed by too much input and too little clarity.
Try simplifying. Try slowing down. Try making it easier for your brain to say yes.
Have you struggled with focus as a developer?

Drop a comment — maybe we’re not that different.

In the previous article, I introduced a Python script that automatically transfers notes created in Obsidian to an existing Notion database for daily logs. This allowed for a balanced workflow where notes can be casually written in Obsidian and later organized in Notion, helping to separate the acts of capturing and structuring your thoughts.
In this follow-up, I'll extend that script to categorize each note based on its tags and automatically create a new page in the appropriate Notion database. Importantly, the original feature—appending the note to the existing daily log—remains intact.
Here’s how the notes will be handled based on tags:
No special functional tag (e.g., only WIP or DONE): The note is appended only to the daily log (as in the previous setup)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


When working with structs or enums in Rust, we often need a way to create a "standard" or "initial" instance without specifying all the fields every time. Manually setting each field can be repetitive, especially for complex types. How can we create a sensible default instance of a type conveniently?
Enter the std::default::Default trait. This trait provides a standardized way for types to offer a default value. If a type implements Default, we can easily get a default instance, simplifying initialization and making our code cleaner, particularly when dealing with configuration structs or optional fields.
Imagine a configuration struct for an application:
struct AppConfig {
    timeout_ms: u32,
    retries: u8,
    api_endpoint: String,
    enable_logging: bool,
}

In this article, I want to tell you the story of the fixing a massive performance problem I faced in one of the projects which had a laggy, frustrating UI with slow renders and excessive API calls. The app had a complex tree-table structure, where every interaction felt sluggish, with blocking times up to 850ms and an explosion of network requests.
It happens just by rethinking how data loaded and components rendered, we slashed blocking time to 70ms (92% faster) and cut API calls by 60%.
How? It wasn’t just about throwing more useMemo at the problem. Instead, we had to:
Break a heavy dependency between the tree, table, and URL state.
Stop recursive fetching that caused O(n) API calls.
Decouple renders so heavy updates wouldn’t freeze the UI.

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight.
“The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.”

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”

"We know that miners will produce 165,000 BTC this year. Already, publicly traded companies have bought more than that. ETFs are at $6 billion in inflows. We think governments are going to be buying. We see this sort of structural difference between demand and supply."

Speaking to Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Carbone argued it is in the best interests of the US to pass comprehensive stablecoin regulations to protect US dollar hegemony in global markets, which has bipartisan appeal and support. Carbone said:
"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote."

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. 
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.
In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…]]></summary>

In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.

Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement, according to a filing on May 15.
Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the rejection does not reverse the company’s victory in the case. The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.

Alderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”

Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.
Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…]]></summary>

XRP price is forming a bullish V-shaped recovery pattern targeting $3.40.

A 53% surge in open interest to $5.06 billion signals bullish sentiment.

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earned $250 million from its complete exit from crypto-friendly Nubank.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.
