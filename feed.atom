        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of .NET development, understanding the differences between IQueryable and IEnumerable is crucial for optimizing application performance and ensuring efficient data querying. In this article, we will explore the fundamental differences, their use cases, and best practices for leveraging each interface effectively.
🔍 What is IEnumerable?


IEnumerable is an interface that allows you to iterate over a collection of objects. It is defined in the System.Collections namespace and works best with in-memory data collections like lists or arrays.
Key Characteristics:
1- In-memory Processing: All operations with IEnumerable are performed in memory.
2- Deferred Execution: It supports deferred execution, meaning the query is only executed when you iterate over it (e.g., with foreach).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm excited to announce the release of Astra v1.1, the latest version of my open-source network scanning tool built for security researchers, sysadmins, and curious tinkerers. Astra combines speed, flexibility, and privacy — all without relying on third-party APIs.
If you’re tired of bloated, cloud-reliant scanners, Astra is for you.
Astra is a Python-based CLI tool that lets you:
Scan domains and CIDR ranges
Identify open TCP ports
Resolve DNS locally
Run scans without relying on external APIs (although ipinfo.io integration is optionally supported)
Whether you're probing a bug bounty target, analyzing your own infrastructure, or conducting research in an isolated lab, Astra gives you full control with no data leakage.
Version 1.1 builds on the foundation of Astra with new scanning modes,…]]></summary>

Introduction:
Malware, short for malicious software, encompasses various programs designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Understanding common malware types is crucial for effective cybersecurity.
Prerequisites:  A basic understanding of computer operating systems and network protocols is helpful, though not strictly necessary to understand the core functionality of these malware types.
Types of Malware:
Viruses: These self-replicating programs attach themselves to other files and spread when those files are executed.  They can range from relatively harmless annoyances to highly destructive.  Example: A virus might add itself to every .doc file on a system.


Worms: Unlike viruses, worms can replicate independently and spread acr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone tells you how to write perfect code. But no one tells you how easy it is to mess things up, especially when you're just starting out.
1. Writing Code Without Planning Anything:
I jumped straight into coding because I was too excited.
The Result: Now, I sketch out a quick plan, even 10 minutes of thinking saves hours of debugging.
2. Copy-Pasting Stack Overflow Without Understanding:
I copied a solution that worked—until it didn’t.
The Result: I still use Stack Overflow, but I make sure I understand every line I paste.
3. Ignoring Git Until the Last Minute:
I lost an entire day’s work because I forgot to commit.
The Result: I commit after every major change and push regularly. Git is now my safety net.
4. Not Reading the Documentation:
I wasted hours searching for answers that were literally in the first paragraph of the docs.
The Result: First I read the docs, then surf the internet for information. Even the order of this matters.
5. Overengineering Everything:
I tried to build “the perfect solution” with 10 extra features I didn’t need.
The Result: Build version 1 very simple. Improve later. Launch ugly, improve fast.
6. Not Asking for Help:
I stayed stuck on a bug for 3 days because I didn’t want to “look dumb” by asking help. It was a terrible mistake.
The Result: I now ask questions early—online, Discord, dev forums. No shame in learning.
7. Testing Code in Production:
I pushed code live without testing.
The Result: I test locally, then deploy to staging, then go live. Never gonna skip testing again.
Final Thoughts:

Push notifications are messages sent from an app or website to a user's device, even when the app or site isn’t actively open. They appear as pop-up alerts, banners, or notification icons on devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers.
The mechanism with which these "Push Notifications" work is usually the use of some sort of background processes, these processes maintain a persistent connection with the designated "Push Server" depending on their device (in the case of Native Push) or their navigator (in the case of Web Push).
There's two types of Push Notifications:

Moody's rating agency degrades US credit rating
Moody's, one of the major credit ratings agencies, downgraded the US government's creditworthiness from Aaa to Aa1 on May 16, citing increased deficits and a mounting national debt.
According to the announcement, the agency forecasts higher US government debt, fueled by increasing interest expense on the debt, and a lack of cost-cutting measures curtailing government spending. The report noted:

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least one partner at Sequoia Capital was reportedly impacted by the recent data breach among Coinbase users, suggesting that data from others at the venture capital firm may also have been compromised. 
According to a May 16 Bloomberg report, Sequoia Capital Managing Partner Roelof Botha’s personal information available through his Coinbase account was stolen after a group of cybercriminals bribed the exchange’s support agents for access to user data. Though Botha had not publicly disclosed his net worth, estimates suggested he had hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a May 15 blog post, saying that some of its users had been targeted with social engineering attacks after the criminals had access to their personal account information. The comp…]]></summary>

On May 16, the protocol unveiled SolvBTC.AVAX, a token that connects Bitcoin (BTC) to real-world assets like US Treasurys and private credit offered by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane. 
The new token was developed through a seven-way partnership involving Solv, Avalanche, Balancer, Elixir, Euler, Re7 Labs, and LFJ, the company said. 
Solv Protocol founder Ryan Chow said the token is a way to link Bitcoin to “real-world economic cycles” in uncorrelated assets such as US government bonds and private credit, as opposed to BTC’s typical boom-and-bust four-year cycle.

The altcoin market cap, excluding Ether (ETH), has added $126 billion in Q2, sparking enthusiasm from analysts who have been waiting for an altseason. Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted a breakout that could rival the explosive 2017 bull run.

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”
