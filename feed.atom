Alright, so we've already talked about the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—how it aims to be the "USB-C for AI," creating a standard way for AI models to get the data and tools (the "context") they need. It sounds great, isn’t it? One standard plug for everything. But here's a practical question: when your AI assistant needs to grab some context using MCP, where does the MCP server providing that context live?

When accessing your site via IP address instead of domain name, it returns a completely different certificate — often the default one.
Let’s break down why this happens, and why it’s not a bug but a behavior defined by the TLS standard.
Imagine this setup:
You configure a SafeLine site using your domain example.com.
SSL is enabled, and a proper certificate is applied.
You access https://example.com — everything looks perfect.
But then you try https://192.0.2.1 — and boom, you get a certificate mismatch or the default SafeLine certificate.

Here's the key insight:
TLS handshake happens before the server ever sees your HTTP request.

This isn't your typical quick survey. SlashData's Developer Nation survey has been tracking global development trends for years, and this edition dives deep into what matters to us as developers:
Programming languages and their real-world adoption
Frameworks & libraries that are gaining traction
Cloud platforms and infrastructure choices
DevOps & CI/CD practices that teams are implementing
AI tools and how they're changing our workflows
Beyond the solid prizes (we're talking $300 toward any AI tool, Logitech MX Master 3S, RODE NT-USB Mini, and various gift cards), there are genuine reasons to participate:
Community Insights: When the results drop, you'll get data-backed answers to questions like "What languages are growing?" and "How are teams using AI tools?"
Industry Impact: Your input helps shape the tools and platforms we all use. Companies pay attention to this data when making product decisions.
Good Cause: They've also added a donation component where your participation can contribute to charitable causes.
The survey runs until July 17, 2025, so there's still time to add your voice to the mix.
If you're interested in seeing where our industry is headed (and maybe winning something useful in the process), take the Developer Nation Survey here.]]></summary>

Every object in Python has a unique identity. The identity tells Python where the object lives in memory. It is fixed and does not change as long as the object exists.
You can check an object’s identity using the id() function. You can also compare the identity of two objects using the is operator. If two names point to the same object, they have the same identity.
Python lets you compare object identity using is and id().
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(a is b)       # True
print(id(a), id(b)) # Same number

Both names point to the same object in memory.
The value of an object is what it holds. The identity is where it lives. Two objects can have the same value but different identities. This happens often with mutable objects like lists.
