        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve built a React or Next.js app that talks to multiple REST APIs, you’ve probably got a file like actions.ts set up as a central spot for fetch calls to public services like the USGS Earthquake API or Nominatim’s reverse geocoder. It works, but the code often ends up repetitive, brittle, and difficult to maintain or scale when different endpoints need to talk to each other.
In this post, we’re going to take that same setup and clean it up with a GraphQL layer powered by Apollo Connectors. Instead of orchestrating data in actions.ts, we’ll define a GraphQL schema that does the work for us. Using a declarative configuration, we’ll unify earthquake and location data in a single query with no need for custom resolvers or custom backend logic. The goal: to make your frontend simpler and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate software delivery, ensuring fast, reliable releases. While specific steps vary by language or framework, the core principles remain the same. Below is a generalized CI/CD workflow applicable to Python (Django), JavaScript (Node.js), Go, Rust, or any other stack.  
1. Pipeline Overview


A CI/CD pipeline typically follows these stages:  
Trigger → 2. Code Checkout → 3. Dependency Installation → 4. Testing → 5. Build → 6. Deploy (Staging) → 7. Approval Gate → 8. Deploy (Production) → 9. Post-Deploy Actions



Let’s break each stage down.  
2. Detailed CI/CD Stages



  
  
  1. Trigger




When?


Code push to main/master.

Pull Request (PR) creation (for pre-merge checks).

Welcome to the managed database era—where backups, scaling, and security aren’t your problem anymore. Let’s pit MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS, and PlanetScale against each other so you can sleep through the night (and keep your sanity).  
Why Managed DBs? (Spoiler: Your Time > Your Code)


Self-hosting databases is like maintaining a nuclear reactor to power a toaster:  
Backup Anxiety: “Did pg_dump actually run last night?”


Scaling Nightmares: “Why is our DB CPU at 99% during Black Friday?”


Security Theater: “I hope no one finds that admin:admin login…”

The Windows Server AD crashed unexpectedly. Despite numerous attempts to bring it back online, it refused to boot. I had to revert to a previously taken VM snapshot—a seemingly simple fix that opened the door to a larger, more complex problem.
The moment the snapshot restoration completed and the AD server came back online, we began experiencing a strange issue: every workstation that was powered on after the AD server recovery couldn’t log in. Passwords were being rejected, and users were hit with “domain trust relationship failed” errors.
Yet, curiously, machines that were turned on before the AD was restored worked …]]></summary>

  Understanding Mutation Observers: A Historical and Technical Context


Mutation Observers were introduced to the Web API in 2014 as a more efficient and powerful means of observing changes in the DOM compared to earlier solutions such as DOMSubtreeModified and DOMNodeInserted. The transition to Mutation Observers was motivated by performance concerns and the need for a more predictive and less resource-intensive method for tracking DOM mutations. Earlier web applications that relied on these older methods suffered from significant performance bottlenecks, often handling thousands of events and leading to excessive recalculations of styles and reflows.
The roots of Mutation Observers can be traced to the deve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generic programming is a style or paradigm of programming languages. Generics allow programmers to write code in strongly-typed programming languages using some types that are specified later, and these types are provided as parameters during instantiation.
Generics enable you to write code that can be applied to multiple types without repeating the same logic for each type. This improves code reusability, flexibility, and type safety.
In Go, generics are implemented through type parameters. A type parameter is a special kind of parameter used as a placeholder that can be any type. They are used in the definitions of functions, methods, and types, and are replaced with specific types during concrete calls.

The V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and is used in several major platforms, including Google Chrome and Node.js. The primary responsibility of V8 is to compile and execute JavaScript code.

I sometimes think that what we use every day makes us who we are. So the better your tools, the more valuable you become as a specialist.
In this article, I have prepared a list of 10 interesting services and modules that will allow you to increase your productivity and make your life much easier.
Well, let's get started! 🏎️
HMPL.js - small template language for displaying UI from server to client


Let's start with this module. First of all, it helps to make your application server-oriented, and also significantly smaller in size.
It is based on customizable requests sent to the server via fetch and processed into ready-made HTML. The language is syntactically block-based and integrated with JSON5 and DOMPurify.
