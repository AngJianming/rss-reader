An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a ‚Äúliquidation magnet‚Äù that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Process for taking over and maintaining a project:
Log in to the application server by VPN or SSH in order to understand where the project files are stored and how the deployment process works. Typically, we'll start with the HTTP server and service-related files.


Log in to the database to ensure we can connect properly. Ideally, take this opportunity to dump and back up the database schema as an SQL file. Even if the project originally followed a Code First approach with migration files, it's very common for projects to shift toward a DB First setup over time, especially after being handed off between multiple developers. Not having a complete DB schema can often lead to major issues.


Check how the connection strings and environment variables are applied, then run the project locally for testing. If there are too many third-party services making it hard to run locally, writing mock services could take a lot of time. In that case, the best approach is to see if we can run the project locally while connecting to the actual staging/production database for testing. (But make sure to check for background services or scheduled jobs that could cause concurrency issues.)



I'll add more if anything else comes to mind. In many cases, taking over a project can be chaotic and unstructured‚Äîblindly following AI suggestions without critical thinking can easily lead to disaster.]]></summary>

HTML Structure
The HTML provides a semantic structure for the card. HTML structure separates visual elements clearly and provides flexibility for styling.

This article explores the different types of loops available in JavaScript, how to use them, and when each is most appropriate.
Consider a scenario where you need to print numbers from 1 to 100. Without loops, you would have to write 100 console.log() statements. With loops, this task becomes simple and efficient:
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {

This hook is unavoidable.
Whenever you need dynamic state that persists across re-renders, this is the one.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

Once your state becomes complex (e.g. multiple correlated fields), useReducer becomes your friend.
It also pairs really well with useContext, letting you update state with simple dispatch calls.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX estate, accusing the defunct crypto exchange of trying to deflect blame for its own failure.
Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance‚Äôs legal team called the suit ‚Äúlegally deficient,‚Äù stating that FTX‚Äôs collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
‚ÄúPlaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,‚Äù the filing said, pointing to Sam ‚ÄúSBF‚Äù Bankman-Fried‚Äôs conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX‚Äôs estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%‚Äì60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there‚Äôs still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a ‚Äúgolden cross‚Äù on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin‚Äôs 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea‚Äôs Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty.
Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.
Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.
Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.

Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.
On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins ‚Äî worth about $2.1 billion ‚Äî were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.

‚ÄúWe are going to allow you to buy it,‚Äù Dimon said at JPMorgan‚Äôs annual investor day on May 19. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to custody it. We‚Äôre going to put it in statements for clients.‚Äù
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,‚Äù he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024.¬†
Dimon‚Äôs Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it ‚Äúworthless‚Äù during the 2021 crypto bull market.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,‚Äù he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. ‚ÄúThe only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf I were the government, I‚Äôd close it down,‚Äù he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin ‚Äúdoes nothing. I call it the pet rock,‚Äù which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.¬†¬†
