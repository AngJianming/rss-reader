        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Take-Two and EA have quietly slipped AI warnings into their latest 10-K filings, flagging that using generative AI in game development could spark “social and ethical issues,” lead to legal headaches and even erode fan trust. They’re doing it because public companies must list any material risk—from hurricanes to worker strikes—so investors know what could go sideways.
Industry watchers like Niko Partners’ Daniel Ahmad point out that nearly every big studio (yes, even Nintendo) is experimenting with AI, mostly at the concept stage. Take-Two’s boss Strauss Zelnick says these tools will boost efficiency but never replace human creativity, while EA and Microsoft foresee short-term layoffs followed by long-term job growth. Both giants have recently cut hundreds of positions, though it’s unclear how much AI played a role.]]></summary>

Andrew “Boz” Bosworth reminds everyone that Meta juggles tons of prototypes—some never see daylight—so Loma/Puffin might shift or morph before launch. Still, snagging marquee content could give Meta serious bragging rights in its mixed-reality showdown with Apple.]]></summary>

Carell insists Mountainhead is even darker and crazier than Succession, comparing its tone to a modern-day Dr. Strangelove.

I decided to write it with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM), using Python—a language that isn't exactly my mother tongue. The ultimate aim was to release it to the public on PyPI.
This is the story of my journey and the lessons I learned along the way.
My first major hurdle was finding a valid client generator for the OpenAPI spec provided by the API. I went down a rabbit hole trying to find a tool that could generate a set of reusable API client classes that would play nicely with my chosen Python dependency management flavoor. It was a frustrating and time-consuming process.

The transform property does not apply to inline elements in a flow layout, as these elements are designed to seamlessly flow with surrounding content. To enable transformations, you can change the element's display property to inline-block or use layout modes like Grid or Flexbox.
The transition property is a vital aspect of CSS animations, allowing for smooth transitions between states of an element. This reduces abrupt changes and enhances user experience by making interactions feel more fluid.
