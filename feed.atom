Cursor is installed on your machine
Ollama is installed on your machine, and you have a model
ngrok is installed on your machine, and you have an ngrok account
Cursor


Go to https://www.cursor.com/ and download Cursor, then install it on your machine.
Ollama


Go to https://ollama.com/ and download Ollama, then install it on your machine.
Go to https://ngrok.com/ and download ngrok, then install it on your machine.
In this article, we'll use deepseek-r1 model
https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1
# 7B-model
ollama pull deepseek-r1:latest

# macOS & Linux
export OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"

# If you are using Windows
set OLLAMA_ORIGINS="*"

ngrok http 11434 --host-header="localhost:11434"

Put the model name you pulled (in this case, the model is deepseek-r1:latest) and click Add model

Put Ollama in API key
Put the URL you get from ngrok command + /v1
The URL looks like https://ngrok_something/v1 


Click Save




  
  
  Step7. Verify Ollama config


We are almost there.
Verify button, we need to unselect all non-local models. So in this case, deepseek-r1:latest is the only selected model.

This guide walks you through what port forwarding is, why it’s required for Minecraft servers, how to set it up in 2025, and what to do if it’s not an option due to internet service provider (ISP) restrictions. It also covers modern tunneling tools like Pinggy that serve as alternatives when port forwarding is not possible.
Port forwarding is a network configuration that allows external devices to access services on a private network. When you set up port forwarding, you tell your router to direct incoming traffic on a specific port (used by Minecraft) to…]]></summary>

I decided our PDF Generation code needs refactoring (a single Laravel service class)


Half way through the refactoring I realized we are using a deprecated library so I decided to upgrade the whole system to start using s more modern pdf Generation system


Half an hour of coding later I realized it's probably better, before I do all the work, pdf Generation should probably be handled by a microservice


You can't do all that without the existing pdf templates. They need to move to the Microservice too. 


I might as well refactor these to make things easier 


PDF templates with blade files is so tedious to work with. I can't test what I am doing. We need a preview function but you can't have that in an API. Let's move this to the CMS 


I might as develop a PDF management tool in CMS with preview function 


I need seeders, factories, migrations 


Templates need to be translated into 4 languages but user might not know what language keys exist


I need a template editor with variables and language keys auto fill.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.
The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. 
Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.
From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:

Often, entities have subtypes—specific versions of themselves that possess additional attributes or behaviors. This is where the concept of specialization in database design comes into play. In this blog, we’ll break down DBMS specialization, explain how it works, and show why it’s an essential part of modeling complex data accurately.
Specialization in DBMS?
Improved Data Organization
Specialization helps organize data logically by grouping shared attributes at a higher level (the supertype) and unique attributes at the lower level (the subtypes).

When feedback lands, especially the kind that catches you off guard or stings a little, it has a way of stirring up questions: Am I failing? Am I not as good as I thought? Do they still trust me?
It's easy to get defensive. Or spiral. Or overcorrect so hard that we lose touch with our instincts. But here's what I've come to believe: receiving feedback well isn't about blindly accepting everything, nor is it about shielding yourself from discomfort. It's about staying centered while making room for growth.

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.

French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Paris-based crypto company Blockchain Group is adding more Bitcoin to its growing treasury through a 63.3 million euro ($72 million) bond sale.
The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

The second man is a Swiss crypto investor who allegedly assisted business partner Joel Woeltz, who is accused of kidnapping Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan and torturing him in a Soho apartment in an attempt to pressure him into revealing his crypto wallet phrase, ABC7 New York reported on May 26.
A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader —  who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.
The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a ‘bad idea’
Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the invest…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

Bitcoin price is capped at the $110,000 level due to sellers and a decrease in spot volumes. Leverage use is driving current rallies into this resistance level.

Traders are watching today’s volumes to see if emerging intraday trends are followed at the US open on May 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index).
