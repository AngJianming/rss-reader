In April 2025, Windsurf (formerly Codeium) rolled out significant pricing updates that made waves in the developer community. First, the company provided OpenAI's o4-mini and GPT-4.1 (equipped with 1 million token context window) freely available to all users for a 2-week time period. Immediately after this free trial period, on April 29, Windsurf followed up with a major revamp of their pricing and offering.
Free plan users now receive 25 prompt credits per month (up from 5). That is equivalent to 100 prompts with GPT-4.1, o4-mini, and other premium models. Devs will be charged once per prompt, regardless of the number of actions Cascade performs in response. This simplification will make it easier for users to anticipate costs and manage thei…]]></summary>

If you've dealt with APIs, you've probably used Postman a lot – making collections, setting up environments, and hitting that "Send" button. It was the top choice and made dealing with APIs much easier for everyone. Big thanks to Postman for that!
But lately, does Postman feel a bit… much? It seems like it’s gotten bigger and, strangely, slower. What used to be a quick tool for simple API calls now feels like a giant program.
What’s Up with Postman? Why People Are Searching for Alternatives to Postman

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While setting up my personal blog, I checked the robots.txt file — and was surprised to see that Google is quietly blocking Yandex, and only Yandex, from indexing some parts of its site. That’s not just a technical detail — it’s a sign of how search engines compete behind the scenes.
For those unfamiliar, robots.txt is a small file websites use to tell search engines what they can and can't access. Most of the time, it's simple and boring — but sometimes it reveals something much bigger.
Google’s robots.txt includes a very specific directive:
User-agent: Yandex
Disallow: /search
Disallow: /about/careers/applications/jobs/results

This means:
Yandex is blocked from crawling Google Search results


Yandex cannot index Google Careers job listings



But here’s the kicker: Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo are not blocked.
Perhaps Yandex previously scraped search results or structured job listings.


Maybe Google wants to block a direct competitor in CIS markets.


Or it could be a strategic move to restrict access to its most valuable data sources.




  
  
  Yandex: Caution, Consistency, Control


Yandex takes a different approach. Its robots.txt shows a broad and consistent defensive policy:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /search
Disallow: /news

Yandex blocks all crawlers, including its own, from indexing its search and news sections. No special targeting. No exceptions. Just uniform rules across the board — a clear contrast to Google’s selective blocking.
Here’s where it gets interesting:

Google only added the Yandex block in April 2025.
🔎 April 28, 2025 — no Yandex block

🔒 April 29, 2025 — Yandex block appears
It wasn’t always there. It was a deliberate update, recently and surgically introduced.
From a technical and ethical standpoint, Yandex’s approach feels more transparent. It applies the same rules to everyone. Google, on the other hand, targets just one rival.
What do you think — is this fair play or gatekeeping?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[您看到的「閃現放大的黑色圖示」問題，幾乎可以肯定是 Font Awesome 圖標載入 時的常見現象，有時被稱為 FOUI (Flash of Unstyled Icons) 或 FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text/Icons)。
發生原因：
 JavaScript 渲染： 您使用的 react-fontawesome 套件會在頁面載入後，透過 JavaScript 將您指定的圖標轉換成 SVG 圖形並插入到頁面中。
 CSS 與時序：


  在 JavaScript 成功將 SVG 插入之前，頁面上可能只是一個空的 <span> 或 <i> 佔位符。
  如果 Font Awesome 的核心 CSS 檔案載入得比較晚，或者瀏覽器先渲染了 HTML 和其他 CSS，這個佔位符可能會短暫地繼承了周圍元素或其他全局 CSS 的樣式（例如很大的 font-size 和預設的 color: black），導致您看到一個放大的黑色方塊或圖標輪廓。
  一旦 Font Awesome 的 JavaScript 和 CSS 都準備就緒，它會用正確的 SVG 圖標替換佔位符，並應用正確的樣式，黑色圖示就消失了。
如何解決：
最推薦的解決方法是遵循 Font Awesome 官方對 Next.js/React 應用的建議，在 _app.js 中手動配置和載入 CSS，避免它自動處理時可能出現的延遲或衝突。
請修改 pages/_app.js 如下：
import React from 'react'
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'
// 1. 導入 Font Awesome config 和 core styles

If you're trying to kill a process by name using Perl, you might run into issues when passing the process name as a variable. This article will guide you through solving a specific error related to an ineffective system command.
Understanding the Issue
The kill command in your Perl script requires a proper PID (Process ID) to terminate a process. The error message you received indicates that the command is not being executed correctly because the output from ps and grep is producing a format that does not match what kill expects.
The problem lies in how the command substitution is being handled in the Perl script. Specifically, the way you're capturing the output of the ps, grep, and awk commands needs adjustment. When you directly enter the process name, it works because the …]]></summary>

For businesses and developers that demand the highest level of control and raw computing power, Bare Metal Dedicated Servers emerge as the top-tier solution. But what exactly are they, and how do they differ from other hosting options? Let’s explore.
A Bare Metal Server is a physical server dedicated entirely to a single tenant. Unlike shared or virtual hosting, where resources are split among multiple users, a bare metal server provides full access to all hardware resources—CPU, RAM, storage, and network bandwidth—without virtualization layers.
In simple terms, it’s like renting an entire building instead of just an apartment. You have total control, and no one else shares your space.

The seizure, announced on May 9 by Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt’s main prosecutor’s office, involved multiple crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dash (DASH). The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA’s history.
The authorities also seized eXch’s German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added.

When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?
It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.
The Justice Department said Chhipa raised funds for the United Nations-designated terror organization through social media, receiving money online or traveling hundreds of miles to a…]]></summary>

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT), Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase’s agreement to buy Deribit highlights the increasing importance of financial derivatives for cryptocurrency exchanges, according to industry executives. 
On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
"Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.

The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. 
“People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the …]]></summary>

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

Brogan told Cointelegraph that the specific mechanism to exempt capital gains taxes outlined in HB 594 is unique and compared it to a similar income tax deduction in the federal tax code. The attorney explained:

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.
