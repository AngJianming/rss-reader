        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple’s newly acquired prime broker, Hidden Road, has launched cryptocurrency swaps for institutional investors in the United States.
The new service allows US institutional clients to trade cash-settled over-the-counter (OTC) swaps across multiple major crypto assets, as Hidden Road announced on May 28.
The new OTC swap product is offered by Hidden Road Partners, the company’s entity regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
The launch follows Ripple’s $1.25 billion Hidden Road acquisition deal announced in April, making the company behind XRP (XRP) one of the first crypto firms to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker.

“Young students were using blockchain before it was mainstream,” Imani explained. From Kenya to Nigeria, local needs, not hype, drove early adoption.

Bitcoin whales accumulate more BTC
Large Bitcoin investors have been adding to their holdings in anticipation of price increases in the future. Data from market intelligence firm CryptoQuant shows that the percentage of wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC has increased sharply since May 6, accompanying a 16% price increase over the same period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World Wide Web and hypertext markup language (HTML) inventor Tim Berners-Lee said that if he were building a domain name service (DNS) today, he would make it “more decentralized.”
Speaking at ETH Prague on stage alongside Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, Berners-Lee reflected on early internet architecture decisions.
“If I could go back […] I would make it more decentralized,“ he said.
DNS was invented in 1983 by Paul Mockapetris, replacing the previous hosts.txt file-based system with a scalable, distributed system for naming IP addresses. Still, while Berners-Lee was not personally responsible for DNS development, he could have opted for a URL structure not tied to the DNS we know today, or he could have pushed for a decentralized alternative.

Africa stands at a crossroads.
With a population projected to double to 2.5 billion by 2050 (UN DESA, 2022), a median age under 20, and smartphone penetration growing exponentially, the continent is poised to become one of the most vibrant digital markets in the world. Yet despite these favorable demographics, we risk missing out on the defining wave of this century: *Artificial Intelligence. *
The global AI industry is expected to contribute over $15.7 trillion to the world economy by 2030 (PwC, 2023). Yet much of Africa is still stuck in “observer mode,” consuming AI content and products instead of creating them.
*The Problem: AI Education in Africa Is Largely Theoretical, Not Practical. *
But there's a catch.
Most online AI education is passive, focused on watching lectures or earning certificates—often without access to the GPUs, datasets, or APIs required to actually build and deploy AI systems.
That’s like learning to drive by watching Formula 1 races—engaging, but insufficient.

When you're writing Rust code, one of the first design questions you'll face is how to handle strings in your function signatures. Should you accept String, or should you use &str? This seemingly small decision can have a big impact on the usability, performance, and clarity of your code.
If you're new to Rust, you might wonder why this decision even matters. After all, both String and &str are used to represent text, right? Well, not quite. In this blog post, we’ll explore why you should almost always prefer &str in function parameters and reserve String for when it’s truly necessary.

I just released an open-source project I’ve been building: AiogramX — a collection of modular, ready-to-use widgets for building rich Telegram bot UIs using Aiogram.
🧱 What It Is


AiogramX simplifies the process of building interactive Telegram bots by giving you clean, high-level components — no more managing raw callback_data or building inline keyboards by hand.
It currently includes:
📚 Paginator — page navigation
🗓️ Calendar — date selection
🧩 CheckboxGroup — multi-select options
🕓 TimeSelector — choose hour/minute
Each widget handles both rendering and interaction logic, so you can focus on user experience — not boilerplate.
🛠️ More Widgets Coming Soon


I plan to add more components like dropdowns, multi-step forms, tabs, and toggle switches.
🧪 Try It Live


Check out the demo bot on Telegram
/demo)
💡 Why I Built It


Working with Telegram bots usually means dealing with callback data, inline keyboards, and routing mess. AiogramX gives you declarative-like building blocks: drop in a widget, hook a callback, done.
Think of it as reusable UI components for Telegram bots — like a mini toolkit for clean user flows.
👐 Looking for Feedback & Support


Would love to hear:
Feature suggestions
Widget ideas
Real-world use cases
Bug reports or PRs
If you find it useful, please give the project a ⭐ on GitHub — it really helps!

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act aims to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.
The passing of the bill may solidify the US dollar’s leading position in the Web3 economy, according to a May 29 report by Foresight Ventures.
By requiring that stablecoins are backed 1:1 to the US dollar, the GENIUS Act reinforces the dollar’s role as the “world’s digital settlement currency,” the report stated. It also allows fintech companies to develop “compliant, secure and user-centric financial solutions,” said Zac Tsui, investment direc…]]></summary>

In a May 29 X post, Aave founder Stani Kulechov said the foundation borrowed $2 million in GHO tokens. “The EF is not only supplying ETH to Aave, but also borrowing from Aave,” Kulechov wrote, describing the development as “the full DeFi circle.”
GHO is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin native to the Aave Protocol. Unlike centralized stablecoins, GHO is governed by Aave’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees interest rates, collateral requirements and facilitator selection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Bank of Russia has permitted financial institutions to offer certain cryptocurrency-based financial instruments to accredited investors.
Russian banks are now free to provide qualified investors with a range of crypto products, including crypto derivatives, securities and other digital financial assets tied to crypto prices, the central bank announced on May 28.
A key stipulation, however, is that these products must not involve the “actual delivery of cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia emphasized.
The announcement came alongside the Bank of Russia reporting a 51% increase in crypto asset inflows by Russian residents in the first quarter of 2025, totaling 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain analysis company Arkham Intelligence claims to have uncovered previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. 
In a post referencing Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, Arkham claimed that it had identified an additional 70,816 BTC linked to the company. At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.
Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm.

Ether’s price outperforms the wider crypto market with 4% gains over the last 24 hours to hit a three-month high of $2,789 on May 29. 

ETH record open interest, rising funding rates and consistent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs fuel the rally.

A classic bullish continuation pattern suggests a potential 46% climb toward $4,000 as ETH reclaims key support.


Ether’s (ETH) price topped $2,780 on May 29 for the first time since Feb. 24. 
Ether was trading at $2,722 at the time of publication, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours and 50% over the last 30 days. Its daily trading volume has jumped 10% to $26.5 billion, suggesting increasing trader interest in the altcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
The May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.
Instead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. 
“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.
The letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.
Favorable regulatory environment
The SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.
Atkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.

The following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.
In a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.
“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. 
The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.
Court “blows a hole in trade talks”
Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”
Bitcoin’s (BTC) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarke…]]></summary>

The strength of Bitcoin’s (BTC) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. 
“This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” 
Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold.

Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30.
Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”
Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”

In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview, Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities.
“If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. 
He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator.

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.
