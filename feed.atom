        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of Coinbase users from Illinois have filed a class-action lawsuit against the crypto exchange, alleging that its identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).
Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

But I just got radio silence.

I even talked to an ex-coworker and he told me he had sent one hundred applications. I don't know if he meant literally 100 applications or not. But I wouldn't be surprised. He only got two or three positive responses.

Let’s break down the three Core Web Vitals that actually matter — FCP (First Contentful Paint), LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) — and how to actually improve them like a pro.
What it measures: Time from page load to when first visible content renders.
Why it matters: It tells users something is happening. A fast FCP makes your app feel snappy.
How to improve it:
✅ Use a minimal critical CSS strategy.
✅ Lazy-load fonts — use font-display: swap.
✅ Prioritize above-the-fold content.
✅ Eliminate render-blocking resources (like giant stylesheets and unused JS).

When building apps with Laravel or even rest-api, validation is a key part of keeping your data clean and reliable. But what happens when you need to apply validation only under certain conditions? That’s where the sometimes method comes in handy. Let’s break it down with a simple explanation and a real-word example.
sometimes in Laravel Validation?


In Laravel, the sometimes method allows you to conditionally apply validation rules. This is especially useful when you only want to validate a field if it’s actually present in the request or if some other condition is met.
For example:
$request->validate([
    'field' => 'sometimes|required|string',
]);

In this case, the field will only be validated if it exists in the request. If the field is not prese…]]></summary>

In this beginner-friendly guide, you'll learn how to implement token rotation in a React app using Axios interceptors, without interfering with your server logic. We'll also compare common token storage options so you can choose what's best for your project.
What is Token Rotation?


Token rotation is a technique where, instead of keeping a refresh token forever, you get a new refresh token each time you use it. This makes your app more secure because even if a refresh token is stolen, it can only be used once before it becomes invalid.

🔍 1. Technical Comparison
📘 2. Typical Application Scenarios
Industrial surge suppression (e.g., motor controllers)
Output voltage clamping in DC-DC converters
Battery charging constant-voltage control
🔹 Recommended Uses for 1N5550:
Power input protection in telecom base stations
Precision high-voltage signal regulation
Voltage regulation in UPS or PLC systems
🌡️ 3. Thermal Design & Mounting Tips
Use thermal grease or pads to ensure proper thermal conductivity.
For continuous operation near maximum power, design with at least 50% thermal margin (e.g., operate 10W parts at 6–7W typical).
🛡️ 4. Reliability and Alternatives
Alternatives:
Need higher breakdown voltage? ➜ Consider 1N5551 (400V)
Need higher power than 1N2820B? ➜ Use 1N2837B (12V, 15W)
Base your selection on Zener voltage (Vz), power dissipation (Ptot), and target circuit conditions:
For high current clamping ➜ Choose 1N2820B
For high-voltage precision regulation ➜ Choose 1N5550

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18.
Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Ether price rose 3% to $2,550 on May 18, triggering $22 million in short ETH liquidations.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”
For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (…]]></summary>

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.
