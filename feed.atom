In mobile app development, tracking user interactions is crucial for understanding user behavior and improving the app experience. Two fundamental events to track are screen views (when users navigate to different screens) and app close events (when users exit or minimize the app). This post will guide you through implementing these events in Flutter applications.
Screen Views: Help understand user navigation patterns and identify popular or problematic screens
App Close Events: Provide insights into user exit points and session durations
We'll cover five main components:
Setting up an analytics service
Creating a custom navigator observer for screen tracking
Implementing app lifecycle handling for app close events

Ruby on Rails (often called Rails) is one of the most powerful and developer-friendly web frameworks available today. Since its release in 2004, it has revolutionized web development by emphasizing convention over configuration (CoC) and the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. Whether you're building a simple blog or a full-fledged SaaS platform, Rails provides the tools to get the job done efficiently.

“Benchmarking should no longer reward the model that climbs highest. It should reveal the one that falls slowest. What matters is not peak performance — but how gracefully we fail.”
This paper confronts the madness of modern NLP benchmarking — a race funded by VC dollars, gamified by leaderboards, and seduced by scale. We reject the premise that bigger is better, and instead ask: What survives when the numbers are stripped away?
We compare two parameter-matched models — a 123 k-parameter Tiny BERT and a 123 k-parameter ElasticFourierTransformer (EFT) — under structured character-level corruption. While EFT proves more resilient at scale (~5 M parameters), both models degrade similarly when compressed. The gains from 40× more parameters? A few points of whipped-cream accuracy th…]]></summary>

I’m sharing what I learned here in case you’re facing the same question: “What’s the best way to load a large amount of data into DynamoDB?”
Spoiler: Step Functions with batched Lambda invocations is the winner — but the path to that conclusion was full of interesting surprises.
If your data is stored in S3 as a CSV or JSON file, and you're looking for a simple, no-code solution to load it directly into DynamoDB, AWS offers an out-of-the-box option.

Introduction:  Docker containers offer lightweight virtualization, but managing numerous containers across multiple hosts becomes complex.  Container orchestration platforms solve this, automating deployment, scaling, and management.  Kubernetes is the most popular, but others exist.
Prerequisites: Before orchestrating, you need a basic understanding of Docker, networking concepts (like ports and DNS), and familiarity with command-line interfaces.  A cloud provider (like AWS, Azure, or GCP) or a local Kubernetes cluster is also necessary.
Advantages: Orchestration offers several key benefits.  It automates the deployment process, ensuring consistency across environments.  It enables automatic scaling, adding or removing containers based on demand.  High av…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["Why can't I just cancel?"
That's not just bad UX. That's a dark pattern—a design technique intended to trick or manipulate users into doing something they wouldn't otherwise do.
And it's more common than you think.
What Are Dark Patterns?
A few of the most typical examples include:
Roach Motel: Easy to get in, hard to get out (e.g., subscriptions).
Forced Continuity: You're charged after a free trial with no warning.
Trick Questions: Misleading wording in checkboxes (e.g., "Uncheck to not opt-out").
Confirmshaming: Guilt-shaming users who decline an offer ("No thanks, I don't like saving money").
Why Should Designers and Developers Care?
Bad UX = Lost trust = Lost business.
Google, the EU, and consumer groups have begun to crack down on dark design patterns. But it starts with us—designers, developers, product managers.
How to Spot and Steer Clear of Dark Patterns
Be Transparent
Make subscriptions easy to cancel.
List all costs prominently up front.
Don't bury important information in the fine print.
Use Honest Language
Say "No, I don't want this" instead of "No, I hate free things.".
Avoid manipulative emotional appeals.
Present Clear Choices
Give users real choices and a clear understanding of the consequences.
Don't use deceptive pre-checked boxes.
Conduct Usability Testing with Real Users
Conduct usability testing with a diverse group of users.
Ask: "Do users feel respected and informed?"
Integrate Ethics into UX Design
Make ethical design a part of your design process.
Include a UX ethics checklist in sprints.
The Long-Term Value of Being Ethical
User frustration
Negative reviews
High churn
Legal action
In contrast, ethical UX generates:
Brand loyalty
Increased user retention
Positive word-of-mouth
Ask Yourself:
Does this interface make the user feel empowered—or tricked?
Is this design leading or misleading?
Your Turn
Leave a comment, share your story, or tag someone who needs to see this.
Let's make the web a better place—one ethical decision at a time.]]></summary>

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall …]]></summary>

Maldives signs $9 billion deal to become international crypto hub
The government of the Maldives signed a $9 billion deal with Dubai-based family office MBS Global Investments to develop a crypto hub in the island nation's capital of Malé and to attract foreign investment opportunities.
Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms.

According to reporting from Le Monde, the May 3 raid resulted in five arrests. Local outlet Le Parisien also said the kidnappers demanded between 5 million and 7 million euros, or up to $7.9 million, to release the captive man.
Although the details on the identity of the victims remain scant, likely for security reasons, the crypto entrepreneur and his father co-owned a crypto marketing firm based in Malta, French media reports.
This incident features similarities to the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland in France in January 2025. Balland was also held for a crypto ransom until he was freed …]]></summary>

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form.
The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico.
Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.
Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.

“OKX also has consumers protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or an oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post.

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.

Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.

This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time.
