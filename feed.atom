        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is beginning to reshape the estate planning field, streamlining routine processes and shifting how attorneys deliver value to clients. While the human element remains central to this deeply personal area of law, AI is enhancing how attorneys operate—both behind the scenes and at the client-facing level.
Key Ways AI Is Impacting Estate Planning Attorneys:
Client Intake and Communication Some firms are using AI chatbots or guided questionnaires to collect initial client information, identify goals, and flag common issues. This reduces administrative work and helps attorneys begin each case with clearer context.
Risk Detection and Compliance AI tools can now analyze estate documents for errors, inconsistencies, or missing provisions. This adds a layer of quality control and helps attorneys ensure documents align with a client’s objectives and current laws.
Educational Tools and Client Empowerment AI-driven platforms can also help clients understand complex concepts like probate, trust funding, or tax exposure—making the attorney’s job easier and consultations more productive.
AI isn’t replacing estate planning attorneys—it’s refining their role. By automating routine tasks, attorneys can focus on personalized strategies, complex family dynamics, and providing the human guidance that clients still deeply value.

When you're bootstrapping a project or simply want to validate an MVP without burning cash on infrastructure, most MVPs don't need a VPS. I just needed a URL I could share, fast. That’s exactly what I did to get DevScout online and test the MVP.
In this article, I’ll explain how I used my own computer as a server, combined with Cloudflare Tunnel, to make the app publicly accessible, allowing me to test everything end-to-end, gather feedback, and only later invest in a proper VPS.
Simple: I didn’t want to spend money before proving the idea had potential.
Even cheap VPS options can be overkill when you're still building and validating your minimum viable product. And for side projects or personal experiments, using your own machine with a tunnel c…]]></summary>

While we were all waiting for the next AI breakthrough, Tim Cook surprised everyone with iOS 26, featuring the new "Liquid Glass" design language. The design refresh is inspired by Apple's VR headset, the Vision Pro, bringing translucent menus, glossy icons and rounded controls across all Apple devices.
But here's the thing about us developers – when Apple shows us something shiny and new, we can't help but think: "I bet I could build that with CSS." 🤓
So naturally, instead of waiting for iOS 26, I decided to recreate Apple's Liquid Glass effect using nothing but HTML and CSS. No JavaScript, no complex frameworks – just good old-fashioned web magic.

I don't deny the importance of making online debate more respectful and grounded in reality. However, I have concerns about the methods currently being employed to achieve this goal.
For instance, the notion that public institutions cannot be doubted at the risk of leading to the collapse of the social order is more in line with totalitarian regimes than democratic ones (especially when people start getting arrested because of this).
Fact-checking and content moderation, in turn, rely too much on the (always subjective) assessment of what is true and what is false. Automati…]]></summary>

I came across a JavaScript library I really liked called Tone.js, and used it to create a simple audio sampler and drum machine in a single app, just a basic version, but still a fun experience.
Here’s the workflow: record an audio clip, trim it, and assign it to a pad. Tweak the audio in the FX rack, then place it on the timeline by clicking the corresponding row. You can also upload a clip or drag and drop audio files onto a pad.

So, yesterday, I released pride-rs to allow Rustaceans to easily add pride flags to their landing pages. But then I thought, "Hmm. This is nice, but it's not nearly gay enough." There was no theatrical entrance, no bright attractiveness, no Ferris the crab doing a dance move on a Progress Pride flag.
So obviously, I needed to take things to the next level.
I should push it to the absolute extreme. I needed to put flags somewhere big, bold, fabulous, and meaningful. Naturally, I used hero crate: a package for making hero sections in WASM: and decided it was time to inject it with unapologetic queer energy.
Thus, the pride component was born.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AWS continues to expand its offer of resource visibility with enhanced security. The newest addition to the arsenal is the integration between AWS Resource Explorer and AWS PrivateLink, now available in all commercial regions. This move marks an important step for organizations that need to locate resources broadly, but without giving up private traffic, especially in environments with tighter security restrictions.
Resource Explorer alone represents a breakthrough in the way administrators view their resources spread across different accounts and regions. Now, with support for PrivateLink, this capability can be achieved within the scope of VPC, without the need to expose calls to the public Internet.
This type of evolution addresses a sensitive point in multi-account architectures: how to ensure that distributed teams have visibility over the environment without compromising private connectivity standards? The new integration solves precisely this dilemma. It enables broad searches for resources using the Console, CLI, or SDKs, all encapsulated within the private VPC fabric.
In practice, this means that it is possible to consult resources on an organizational scale, with enhanced security and without relying on public routes. The experience is still accessible via the unified search bar, which maintains operational fluidity even in environments with tighter governance.
The big advantage here is not just in the discovery itself, but in the way this discovery is made. By keeping traffic within the PrivateLink domain, the risk of exposing sensitive metadata and API calls is drastically reduced. This control is essential for companies that need to meet more demanding compliance requirements, especially in sectors such as finance, healthcare, or government.
With this update, Resource Explorer takes another leap towards becoming not just an inventory tool, but a central point of contextual visibility, and now more compatible with corporate security policies.
I hope you enjoyed it! See you next time.]]></summary>
