        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Differences Between Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing


While Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) are often mentioned together, they represent two distinct processes within cybersecurity testing. Understanding the difference helps organizations plan better security strategies.
This is an automated or semi-automated process that scans IT infrastructure for known vulnerabilities. It provides a broad view of weaknesses but does not exploit them.
Pen testing involves manual, controlled attempts to exploit vulnerabilities found during assessments. It shows how deep an attacker could penetrate and the potential damage.
A vulnerability scan highlights areas needing attention, but only penetration testing confirms real-world exploitability.
StrongBox IT provides comprehensive web application VAPT services combining both approaches to deliver a full security picture.
Investing in both vulnerability assessment and penetration testing is vital for robust security. This combined approach uncovers hidden risks and prepares organizations to defend against cyberattacks.

A recent announcement has sent ripples through the developer community: OpenAI is confirming its transition to Rust for rewriting its popular AI coding assistant, the Codex CLI (now integrated into ChatGPT CLI). This tool, initially built with Node.js, is now fully embracing Rust.

This isn't merely a simple tech stack change; it's a strong industry trendsetter. From frontend build tools to top-tier AI infrastructure, why are giants like OpenAI "abandoning" the mature Node.js ecosystem for Rust? The answer lies in a profound reconsideratio…]]></summary>

These built-in collection types offer powerful ways to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently. Lists in Python are used for ordered and mutable sequences, while tuples provide an immutable alternative. Sets help manage unique data and perform operations like union and intersection, making them ideal for membership testing. Dictionaries are perfect for key-value pair storage, widely used in data science, machine learning, and web development. Mastering these core Python collections is essential for writing clean, optimized, and scalable code in 2025. Whether you’re a Python beginner or preparing for coding interviews, understanding these Python data types will give you a solid foundation. These collections are frequently used in real-world projects, from backend development to automation scripts.

You write your Dockerfile, build the image, and... it's 2GB. For a simple Node.js app. Your deployment pipeline is crying, your servers are groaning, and your wallet is getting lighter with every cloud storage bill.
Let's start with a real-world scenario. You're building a React application that needs to be compiled and served by an Nginx server. Here's what your Dockerfile might look like without multi-stage builds:
dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
RUN npm install -g serve
EXPOSE 3000

Alright, so we've already talked about the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—how it aims to be the "USB-C for AI," creating a standard way for AI models to get the data and tools (the "context") they need. It sounds great, isn’t it? One standard plug for everything. But here's a practical question: when your AI assistant needs to grab some context using MCP, where does the MCP server providing that context live? Is it running on your computer, or is it somewhere on the Internet?
There are two main types: Local MCP Servers and Remote MCP Servers (…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using SafeLine WAF or any reverse proxy with SSL enabled, you might encounter a confusing situation: 
When accessing your site via IP address instead of domain name, it returns a completely different certificate — often the default one.
Let’s break down why this happens, and why it’s not a bug but a behavior defined by the TLS standard.
Imagine this setup:
You configure a SafeLine site using your domain example.com.
SSL is enabled, and a proper certificate is applied.
You access https://example.com — everything looks perfect.
But then you try https://192.0.2.1 — and boom, you get a certificate mismatch or the default SafeLine certificate.
Before HTTP


Here's the key insight:
TLS handshake happens before the server ever sees your HTTP request.

That means the server doesn’t know …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just completed the latest Developer Nation Global Survey, and it got me thinking about how much our industry has evolved this year. If you're curious about where development is heading and don't mind the chance to win some solid gear, it's worth your time.
This isn't your typical quick survey. SlashData's Developer Nation survey has been tracking global development trends for years, and this edition dives deep into what matters to us as developers:
Programming languages and their real-world adoption
Frameworks & libraries that are gaining traction
Cloud platforms and infrastructure choices
DevOps & CI/CD practices that teams are implementing
AI tools and how they're changing our workflows
Beyond the solid prizes (we're talking $300 toward any AI tool, Logitech MX Master 3S, RODE NT-USB Mini, and various gift cards), there are genuine reasons to participate:
Community Insights: When the results drop, you'll get data-backed answers to questions like "What languages are growing?" and "How are teams using AI tools?"
Industry Impact: Your input helps shape the tools and platforms we all use. Companies pay attention to this data when making product decisions.
Good Cause: They've also added a donation component where your participation can contribute to charitable causes.
The survey runs until July 17, 2025, so there's still time to add your voice to the mix.
If you're interested in seeing where our industry is headed (and maybe winning something useful in the process), take the Developer Nation Survey here.]]></summary>

A ideia principal deste projeto é enviar um comando para criar um pedido. Quando o pedido for criado, serão enviadas duas mensagens: OrderPlaced e OrderPaid. Em caso de falha, nenhuma mensagem deve ser enviada.
