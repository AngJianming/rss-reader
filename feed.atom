        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to create a custom map using a large image in Leaflet, a lightweight JavaScript library for building interactive maps in web applications.
This technique is useful when working with non-geographical maps or images that you want to make interactive, zoomable, and possibly annotated.
Here are some use cases where custom maps from image are applicable:
Indoor Maps: This is a common use case—think of malls, airports, or exhibition halls where a visual indoor layout helps visitors navigate.
Video Game Maps: Many games come with expansive in-game worlds. Custom maps allow for interactive player guides. For example, The Forest Map provides an interactive map for players of The Forest game.
Zoomable Images: You’re not limited to maps. If you have a large im…]]></summary>

Flutter: "Come, beautiful widgets, smooth animations, and one codebase to rule them all!"


React Native: "Hey, remember JavaScript? Yeah, just slap some of that in here, and we’ll call it a day."



But when should you actually choose Flutter over React Native? And more importantly, will this decision haunt you like a bad ’90s haircut? Let’s break it down—with humor, pop culture references, and enough code snippets to make you look smart in meetings.

Unlike non-semantic elements like <div> or <span>, which provide no specific information about their content, semantic tags such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, and <section> convey the structure and context of the content they enclose.

Most memory leaks can be found fairly easily with a good heap dump analyzer, since the tool instantly highlights memory leak suspects. This is a great starting point, but to troubleshoot elusive issues, we need to go a little deeper.
This article discusses what we can do if the leak suspect chart doesn’t give us the answers we need.
A memory leak occurs when unnecessary objects remain in memory, in spite of the best efforts of the garbage collector (GC). The diagram below shows the difference between a healthy GC memory pattern, and a pattern indicating a memory leak.
