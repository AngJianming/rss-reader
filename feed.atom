A couple of days ago, I talked about the basic layout and custom navigation bar when developing HarmonyOS applications through Uniapp. Both of these were limited to the development on the page. Today, we attempt to perform some data operations to share the contents of the optional API and the composite API.
The script code part of the homepage project code we initialized is usually like this:
export default {
    data() {
        return {
            title: 'Hello',

        }
    },
    onLoad() {
    },
    methods: {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Testing is one of the most important skills every developer should master. Yet, it is often overlooked or rushed. Good testing saves time, reduces bugs, and makes your code more reliable and your life easier!
Why Testing Matters


Imagine you build a feature and it works perfectly on your machine. But when it goes live, users find bugs. Testing helps catch those bugs before your users do.
Benefits of testing:




Catches bugs early


Makes code easier to maintain


Gives confidence to add new features


Helps others understand your code




  
  
  Types of Testing Every Developer Should Know



  
  
  1. Manual Testing




You run the app and try different things yourself.


Good for quick checks and UI testing.


But it is slow and error-prone if you rely on it alone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For years, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been at the core of many advanced AI systems. It provided a smart way for models to retrieve relevant documents and generate answers based on that data — allowing AI to access fresh, real-world information without retraining. But now, with the launch of Gemini 2.0 Flash, a question looms large in the AI community:
Let’s break it down.
🔍 What is RAG and Why Was It a Big Deal?
Think of it as an AI with a smart search engine in its brain.
It was especially useful in:
Enterprise search tools
🚀 What is Gemini 2.0 Flash?
But don’t let the word “Flash” fool you. It’s not just about speed.
It combines:
Long-context understanding
💥 So, Is RAG Really Dead?
Gemini Flash isn’t just competing with RAG.
Instead of setting up a full retrieval pipeline — with vector stores, chunking, embeddings, re-ranking, etc. — Gemini Flash can ingest large documents directly, remember what matters, and answer complex questions in real-time.
That means:
Less engineering overhead
🧠 Why This Matters for Developers and Businesses
For businesses, this translates to:
Faster time to market
🔮 The Future: RAG 2.0 or No RAG at All?
Models like Gemini 2.0 Flash are making RAG optional, not essential.
We’re entering a new era where LLMs are becoming self-reliant, real-time, and capable of processing massive amounts of information without help from external retrieval tools.
🧩 Final Thoughts
Gemini 2.0 Flash isn’t just fast. It’s redefining the architecture of how we build with AI.
So the question isn’t just “Is RAG dead?”]]></summary>

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

In a May 12 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, prosecutors recommended Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentence Council to two years in prison for his role in posting a message to the social media platform X suggesting that the SEC had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time in January 2024. The fake announcement, which shook markets in the roughly 24 hours before the regulator actually approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, led to the arrest of Council.

During his keynote address at the Commission’s May 12 roundtable on tokenization and digital assets, Atkins welcomed “a new day at the SEC,” adding that “policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.”

Bitcoin price saw profit booking near $105,819, signaling that bears remain active at higher levels.

Select altcoins have continued to move higher, indicating increased investor interest.  

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into th…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project’s CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 
He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That’s the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  
The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

According to a May 12 X post, Backpack now allows FTX EU users who selected it as the redistribution platform to claim their euro balance. Users must first complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
Backpack’s support page also said that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU:
“If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.”
