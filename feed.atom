If you're a developer and you're not using AI tools, you're already falling behind. From boosting productivity to eliminating grunt work, AI coding assistants are now a core part of engineering teams.
JPMorgan reports its AI coding assistant has boosted engineer productivity by 10–20 % (intrguing,right?)


Goldman Sachs says developers using its in-house Copilot saw up to 20 % efficiency gains—as CEO David Solomon calls it, “a huge tailwind”.

However, with the convenience of these frameworks comes a familiar challenge: managing state synchronization between your backend logic and frontend UI components. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced as applications grow in complexity.
If you've built applications with NiceGUI (or similar frameworks with a Python backend and browser frontend), you've likely encountered the following scenario:
A user interacts with a UI component (like checking a todo item)
This triggers an event handler in your Python code
Your code updates some internal state (the todo item's completed status)
You manually update other dependent UI components (task count…]]></summary>

PDF Viewing: Loading PDF files of various types and sizes should be smooth.


Default Toolbar: Basic functions such as search, zoom, page navigation and download should be readily available


Print Preview: Depending on where the viewer is rendered, print results may not work as expected.



Although there are a few open-source libraries PDF Viewer for Vue like @tato30/vue-pdf or vue-pdf-embed, unless you are looking for a simple PDF renderer, these solutions may not be sufficient.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em 2024, apenas 13% das empresas brasileiras aplicaram IA em seus projetos¹ internos ou como produtos e soluções.
O problema não é infraestrutura.
Recentemente vi aqui uma empresa com vaga aberta de Dev Full Stack Ai/Ml e isso me fez pensar que o maior gargalo brasileiro na adoção de IA hoje não é tecnologia, é a falta de talentos prontos.
Enquanto alguns compram licença software caro para apresentar no board ou terceirizam projetos inteiros para consultorias gringas, o que falta mesmo são profissionais com capacidade real de conhecer, construir, escalar, gerenciar e sustentar IA dentro das empresas.
O déficit de profissionais em tech e IA já ultrapassa meio milhão de vagas não preenchidas. Mas esse déficit não é de profissionais generalistas, dos estudantes e entrantes de nível JR. 
O mercado precisa de gente em níveis de qualificação, de especialistas para suprir demandas técnicas, de gente que conheça  não só qual framework utilizar, mas que siaba de negócios, que saiba prever e escalar um projeto. Gente para decisões.
As empresas precisam urgentemente criar núcleos internos e experimentais debruçados sobre soluções de IA, buscar soluções open-source - que são inúmeras, criar no mínimo seus próprios servidores internos com documentações organizadas para extrair dados, ter seu RAG clássico e saber organizar informações de seus relatórios para transformar suas decisões.
Isso que seria o básico para a inovação e transformação através do uso prático da IA como ferramenta não é realidade ainda para a maioria das empresas brasileiras.
Hoje, o cenário do mercado geral está dividido em 3 grupos:
Quem já tem sua máquina interna de IA.
Quem recorre ao outsourcing técnico.
Quem ainda está debatendo se "vale a pena" ou se o "ChatGPT" vai ajudar a criar una planilha ou escrever um e-mail.
Os dois primeiros crescem.


IA não é um projeto. 
A única pergunta que importa agora não é mais "quando adotar IA" ou "Qual escolher".
A pergunta é:
Como escalar IA pata soluções reais mesmo sem profissionais prontos?

Enter Python.
If you’re working in QA or development, you’ve probably heard someone say, “Just automate it with Python.” And honestly, they’re not wrong.

That’s exactly why I built Supadex — a mobile companion for developers who want real-time visibility and control over their Supabase instances, even when they’re away from their laptop.
Supabase is amazing, but if you've ever tried to quickly check a query result or manage a storage bucket while commuting or in a meeting, you know it's not super mobile-friendly.
