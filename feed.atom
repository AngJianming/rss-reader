Transforming Design Workflows
Okay, so, design used to be slow. Like, painfully slow. Hours spent tweaking tiny details, wrestling with software, and generally feeling like a robot. But things are changing, and fast. AI is stepping in to handle the repetitive stuff, freeing us up to actually be creative. Think of it as having a super-efficient assistant who never gets tired of resizing buttons or aligning text.
Automated tasks reduce design time.
AI helps maintain design consistency.
Designers can focus on the bigger picture.
It's not about replacing designers; it's about augmenting their abilities. AI can handle the tedious tasks, allowing designers to focus on strategy, user experience, and the overall creative vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Microsoft Visual Studio provides a way to add external tools with options from arguments and the initial directory. The output window prompts for arguments. Once an external tool has been set up, it is accessed from the tools menu, which can be inconvenient if used often.
A convenient way to access external tools would be to add tools to the Visual Studio toolbar.
The problem is that when a developer wants to add an external tool to the Visual Studio toolbar, external tools show up as shown below, making it difficult to know which tool is the one to add.

First, learn where the settings file is located which may be different for the version of Visual Studio, at time of this article the location for VS2022 is.
C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\17.0_f56beab6\Settings
Where UserName is the developer's Windows Login name. Combine this path with the file name CurrentSettings.vssettings.
Open CurrentSettings.vssettings and a developer will be lost with an unformatted XML file.
Let's provide ChatGPT with the file CurrentSettings.vssettings and a simple prompt.
Prompt: Using C# read nodes for ExternalTools.
ChatGPT got it right without additional prompts. For ease and a quick solution a .NET Core Windows Form project was used.

Now when a developer wants to add an external tool to Visual Studio toolbar, run this utility to get the external tool name.

Code produced by ChatGPT is straight forwarded and easy to understand. In the source code the file Copilot.md has the full response.

External tools are a great asset to developers, and the provided utility allows developers to add these tools to Visual Studio’s toolbar for easy access.]]></summary>

  📦 What Is Git?


Git is a version control system-— it tracks changes in your code (or any set of files), so you can go back in time, collaborate with others, and avoid messy mistakes.
Think of it like a magical undo button + time machine + teamwork assistant.
First, check if Git is installed. On most common Linux operating systems, it is pre-installed. Run git --version to check. If it is not installed, or gives you a command not found error, head over to http://git-scm.com/ and download it. Restart your terminal.. and boom. Git should be installed. Let's get to using it.
Here’s how Git usually works:
Initialize a repository
Make changes
Stage the changes
Commit them
Let’s walk through it.
## Make your first Git project.
First, open your selected project and run git init. This should create a hidden .git folder.
Next, select the files you would like to commit using git add <file name>, or, to add all files, fun git add .! 
Once you've added your files, run git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (Replace accordingly) and sign in with your Git[hub/lab] account.
Finally, once you have your files added and repository marked, run git commit -m "[your changelog message]!]]></summary>

It was 2:41 AM. Procrastination had sneaked into my sprint without warning, and suddenly, the night before the deadline, I found myself buried under a mountain of work. The reason? A massive refactor that, to be honest, no one asked for.
Just like the meme, I had big dreams of refactoring the component I’ve been working on. The opportunity came when someone on my team proposed building a "Generic Framework" to speed up the integration of third-party tools (I can’t share details, but it’s probably been the most ambitious project of my career). So, I jumped at the chance and proposed several long-overdue refactor tickets.

"You know, you could also host your site at home."
It's possible, yes. And I thought to myself: how could I do it... for FREE?
To make a site accessible from the internet, what do you need?
 A server – in my case, it'll be my desktop.
 A public IP – I have one, but it's dynamic (it changes).
 Continuous uptime – and with the power cuts around here, we can forget about that.
 A domain name – because sharing your IP address isn't very cool.
I'll handle finding solutions for points 1, 2, and 4.
3, I'll leave that to the power company (good luck, folks, I'm counting on you 😉).
This is the part where I'm supposed to tell you how I discovered America and defeated Satan before stumbling upon the FreedomBox project, blah blah blah...
But let's be serious: today, I'm talking about GnuDIP, a DDNS service that FreedomBox introduced me to – and it's the real deal.
GnuDIP is a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service.
domain name to a changing IP address – typically what you have if you're with a standard ISP.
The public instance available at gnudip.datasystems24.net offers two free domains:
freedombox.rocks
sds-ip.de
And yes, it's 100% free.
Go to https://gnudip.datasystems24.net

Hostname: choose a short, simple name with no special characters.
Domain: select sds-ip.de or freedombox.rocks.

Once registered, go back to the login page and sign in.
But you can change it manually:

If your IP changes regularly (as it does with many providers), GnuDIP offers a simple solution: the "Quick Login URL".
Just click on "Set quick login URL", copy the link, and use it in a small script that runs regularly, using cron for example.
A simple curl to this link will automatically update the domain's IP:

bash
curl "[https://gnudip.datasystems24.net/nic/update?username=...&password=...&hostname=](https://gnudip.datasystems24.net/nic/update?username=...&password=...&hostname=)..."]]></summary>
