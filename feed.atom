Modern web development calls for close interaction with backend APIs. Frontend development might be stalled while waiting for backend APIs to be ready. Mocking helps close that gap, although maintaining mocks by hand becomes difficult, especially as APIs evolve. This is where the power of the Mock Service Worker (MSW) and the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) comes into play. This post will show how to automatically create MSW handlers using an OpenAPI spec, generate mock data, and add realistic delays to the mock server. 
This enables you to spin up accurate, realistic mocks with minimal manual effort and full alignment with your API contract, speeding up frontend development.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a machine-readable contract for your API. You define everything up f…]]></summary>

I want to share the story behind my open-source project, BlackWave—a social network simulator where real users can interact with thousands of autonomous AI bots, each with a unique personality, memory, and behavior. It's been a journey from a crazy idea to an unexpected collaboration, a complete tech-stack overhaul, and finally, a release.
It all started around May 15th. An idea struck me: what if I created a Twitter clone, but not for the masses? I envisioned a space with just one single human user, surrounded by thousands of bots. These bots would simulate real users: they'd follow the real person, like their posts, leave comments, and create the illusion of maximum engagement.

The world needed interactivity, and this demand became the root cause for a browser-based scripting language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When dealing with multiple forms on a single page, especially when the forms contain duplicate input names, Laravel’s default validation approach can cause issues. By default, validation errors are tied to the input fields, meaning the error messages are displayed across all forms, not just the one that was submitted. This can be confusing for users.
To resolve this, we can use Named Error Bags, which allow us to store and display validation errors for specific forms separately:
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validation = Validator::make($request->all(), [
        'name'  => 'required|min:25',
        'email' => 'required|unique:users,email,NULL,id,deleted_at,NULL',

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s explore some powerful Laravel pagination methods that supercharge your pagination functionality. First up is the withPath method in Laravel pagination, which customizes the URI used for pagination links:
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users', function () {
    // Original pagination link (without custom path)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page=1
    $users = User::paginate(15);

    // New pagination link (with custom path)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/admin/users?page=1
    $users->withPath('/admin/users');
});

The appends method allows you to add additional query parameters to the existing pagination URL:
use App\Models\User;

Route::get('/users', function () {
    // Original pagination link
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page=2
    $users = User::paginate(15);

    // New pagination link (with the appended query string)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page=2&sort=asc
    $users->appends(['sort' => 'asc']);
});

In some cases, you may have multiple paginations on a single page. If you use numerous paginator instances without differentiation, they may conflict with each other. To resolve this, assign a unique name to each paginator instance:
// This will generate a URL like: https://example.com/users?foo=3
User::where('votes', '>', 100)
    ->paginate(perPage: 15, columns: ['*'], pageName: 'foo');

The onEachSide method allows you to customize the number of pagination links that are displayed before and after the current page link:
{{ $users->onEachSide(5)->links() }}
