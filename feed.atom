As the foundational language for web pages, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is widely used in fields such as web data processing and web development. Whether developers optimize web structures or data analysts extract information from web pages, HTML processing is indispensable. This tutorial focuses on core operations like HTML parsing, modification, and data extraction, helping readers master comprehensive methods and techniques for handling HTML.  
A standard HTML document starts with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and includes the <html> root element, which nests two main sections: <head> and <body>.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you don't need Blazor server and you just want to load WebAssembly resources to the client first before rendering and running anything, this is the starter template configuration for you. 
dotnet new blazor -o MyApp -f net9.0 -int WebAssembly -ai
-o MyApp - output
-f net9.0 - target framework
-int WebAssembly - interactivity 
-ai - all interactive, applies the config at the top level
This creates MyApp.sln, MyApp and MyApp.Client project folders. If you want to add WebApi, configure it in MyApp project.
This still has prerendering! To remove it entirely, edit MyApp/Components/App.razor:
Change this:
<HeadOutlet @rendermode="InteractiveWebAssembly" />
...
<Routes @rendermode="InteractiveWebAssembly" />

to this:
<HeadOutlet @rendermode="new InteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode(prerender: false)" />
...
<Routes @rendermode="new InteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode(prerender: false)" />

Note: Server prerendering gives unintended output and behavior when you want to run things in WebAssembly like redirect in AuthorizeRouteView>NotAuthorized. Removing server prerendering means removing the illusion of quick initial load.
If you want to authorize access to pages entirely on WebAssembly, allow anonymous on blazor components in MyApp/Program.cs:
app.MapRazorComponents<App>()
    .AllowAnonymous() //disables server-side authorization for Blazor
    .AddInteractiveWebAssemblyRenderMode()
    .AddAdditionalAssemblies(typeof(MyApp.Client._Imports).Assembly);

Note: Server-side authorization of Blazor prevents you from loading the entire WebAssembly app when you type secure page in the address bar (e.g.: "/profile"). Since we will authorize in the client-side, we can bypass server authorization.
Warning! Client side is not secure. When page access / authorization is done on the client-side, there should be a final validation and authorization in your Web API when processing requests.

This does not cover PWA but it can be a starting point.]]></summary>

Many companies struggle to find the right balance when they hire data scientists and DevOps professionals. The key lies in understanding that these roles don't compete—they collaborate to create robust, data-driven systems that can handle real-world demands.

Provider hell with nested contexts for filters, properties, favorites, and map state
