With globalization, remote work, and multicultural commerce on the rise, cross-language communication is more important than ever. From individuals learning a new language to businesses localizing their content, the ability to translate accurately and efficiently has become a top priority.
At first glance, Spanish and Italian appear similar: they use comparable sentence structures, have overlapping vocabulary, and share many linguistic features. However, these surface-level similarities can be misleading.
False cognates (e.g., "embarazada" in Spanish means pregnant, not embarrassed)

BTC price action dipped below $107,000 before rebounding into the weekly close, and some are eagerly anticipating new record highs.

US inflation data meets bond market woes this week as the Federal Reserve shows no signs of cutting interest rates.

On exchanges, the taker buy/sell ratio is causing concern for analysis amid cooling order book activity.

One whale, however, is having fun — and his successive longs and shorts are being increasingly watched in trading circles.

Funding rates are not spiking despite current prices — a key silver lining for price upside sustainability.

Time Complexity Analysis:
ter loop runs n times.
Inner loop runs about n - 1, then n - 2, ..., 1 times.
Total comparisons ≈ n * (n - 1) / 2 ≈ O(n²) (quadratic).
As the number of packages grows, this approach becomes very slow.
Space Complexity Analysis:
We only use a few variables.
Space complexity is O(1) (constant space).

For years, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have been the go-to solution for connecting remote employees to corporate networks. But with today’s evolving digital landscape, VPNs are falling short in several key areas—security, performance, and user experience.
While VPNs once offered a reliable way to connect to internal networks, their architecture is no longer ideal for today’s distributed, cloud-first environments. Here are the main reasons organizations are replacing legacy VPNs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine if your house had a security system so smart that it not only caught intruders in real time but also locked your doors and called for backup automatically. That’s exactly what Drosera is doing for the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).
So What Exactly Is Drosera?
Whether it’s a bug, an exploit attempt, or a suspicious transaction, Drosera is there to spot it and respond instantly  without waiting for a human to step in.
How Does It Work?
Traps –> The Watchers
These are smart contracts that monitor the blockchain. A Trap is like a detective, always watching what's happening and deciding if something looks wrong like an exploit or a contract acting suspiciously.
Each Trap has:
An off chain brain that gathers and analyzes data.
An on-chain trigger that tells a DeFi app to do something when 
needed (like pause trading or freeze funds).
2. Operators –> The Enforcers
But they don’t just jump in blindly. They have to opt into a Trap, proving they’re ready and trusted to do the job. Once they’re in, they help monitor the blockchain and take quick action when needed.
3. Seed Nodes –> The Connectors
Why Drosera Matters
Drosera is built to stop those losses before they happen.
It’s fast, decentralized and automated, meaning there's no single point of failure, no waiting around, and no panic buttons. Developers can focus on building while Drosera watches their back.
Who Is Drosera For?
DeFi Developers who want to build apps with security baked in.
Security Researchers who want to deploy automated monitoring 
tools.
Node Operators who want to help protect the ecosystem.
Anyone who cares about making the DeFi space safer for everyone.
Drosera is more than just a tool. It’s a movement toward a more secure, resilient, and self healing DeFi ecosystem.
In a world where billions are on the line, having a decentralized security system like Drosera isn’t a luxury —> IT'S A NECESSITY.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost artificial intelligence chip specifically for China, following restrictions on exporting its more expensive model.
Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.
An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters it was still evaluating the company’s limited options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from Chin…]]></summary>

Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on May 25 that he knew nothing about Trump’s May 22 memecoin dinner and opted not to share his opinion on the event, which 35 House Democrats have called for the Justice Department to investigate.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn't be outraged.”

Five US banking groups led by the American Bankers Association asked the regulator to remove its rule in a May 22 letter, arguing that disclosing cybersecurity incidents “directly conflicts with confidential reporting requirements intended to protect critical infrastructure and warn potential victims.”
The group, which also included the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Institute of International Bankers, claimed that the rule compromises regulatory efforts to enhance national cybersecurity.

Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.”
Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier, with several of its customer support …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
"This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens."

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.
