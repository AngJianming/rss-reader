  Introduction


The Wake Lock API is an essential web technology that allows developers to prevent devices from dimming or locking the screen while specific tasks are ongoing. This API is crucial in scenarios such as video conferencing, gaming, and automotive applications where uninterrupted screen visibility is imperative. This comprehensive guide aims to provide an exhaustive exploration of the Wake Lock API, covering its historical context, technical implementation, edge cases, performance considerations, debugging techniques, and real-world applications.
Screen dimming and locking behaviors have historically presented challenges for web developers, particularly on mobile devices. Users expect their screens…]]></summary>

Let’s be honest — developers and designers haven’t always played nicely.
One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.
Because writing good code is only part of the job — making something people actually enjoy using? That’s where the magic happens. And designers get that instinctively.
So, what exactly can developers learn from designers? A lot more…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management = better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user's entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.]]></summary>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That's when it struck me—we're no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here's why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it's only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That's the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What's one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let's spread awareness together.]]></summary>

Let's talk about why writing 100 lines of clean, readable code is often better than a 2-liner magic trick, with real-world examples to back it up.

"If I can do this in 2 lines, why write 100?"
But here’s the truth:
Short code is not always readable


It’s harder to debug


It's often less maintainable


It usually lacks context, error-handling, and clarity



Let’s look at some real-life analogies and coding scenarios to understand this better.

From satellite imagery analysis to artifact recognition, AI is transforming archaeology into a dynamic, data-driven discipline. This fusion marks the dawn of a new era—one where algorithms are just as crucial as excavation tools.
Before diving into AI’s role, it’s essential to understand the limitations that have traditionally held archaeology back. Field excavations are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Many sites take years, sometimes decades, to fully unearth and understand. Furthermore, only a fraction of potential archaeological sites have ever been explored—leaving countless treasures buried and untouched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.
Here are the main differences:
Data Storage
value type(independent copy)
Example: var a1 = b1 creates a new copy
class 
Example Value Type (struct):
struct Person {
    var name: String
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "Bulldog"
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print("Object is being deallocated")
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count = 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}


If you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.]]></summary>

OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either
Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,”  Xu said.

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.
In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

Analyst predicts that a low VIX, specifically below 18, signals a risk-on market, which could potentially boost the Bitcoin price to $135,000 within the next 100 days.

The stablecoin market cap hits $220 billion, driving crypto liquidity and Bitcoin’s bullish price action.

A negative Bitcoin funding rate hints at a possible short-squeeze to $100,000.

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government is aiming for a 90% adoption rate among local merchants. The executive also told Cointelegraph:
"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds.

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. 
It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Ether’s price has struggled in the first quarter of 2025, a US-based investment adviser firm, Two Prime, has dropped support for ETH and adopted a Bitcoin-only strategy.
After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.
