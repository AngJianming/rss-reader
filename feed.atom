I'm back with another update on my writing journey, and this time it's something completely different from what I've shared before. After months of thinking, restructuring, and honestly, a bit of soul-searching about what I really wanted to create, I'm excited to introduce you to Arliz – but not the version you might have seen in my previous posts. This is a complete reimagining of the project.
First, let me explain the name. Arliz started as a random choice, but over time I found a meaningful backronym that perfectly captures what this book is about:
Arrays • Reasoning • Logic • Identity • Zero
Arrays: The fundamental data structure we're exploring
Reasoning: The logical thinking behind data organization

Bullet Summarizer is a summarization-as-a-service solution that acts based on email forwarding. The main goal is to drastically reduce the time needed to catch up on lengthy email threads, especially when multiple participants are involved.
The application can be directly integrated into any existing system, leveraging AI capabilities (any LLM can be integrated - ChatGPT has been used for the demo due to ease of implementation). All the data collected can also be stored into a client's databse for future reporting, analysis and tracking.
The core use case consists of saving time and reducing decision fatigue through a clean and structured view on relevant email threads.

Andrej Karpathy recently introduced the idea of "vibe coding" on X (formerly Twitter), which is a process where we develop apps but "forget that the code even exists". I believe in this approach, but I also have a fundamental need: code understanding: what AI has executed; does it fulfill requirements, and is it safe? 
Through documentation can solve the problem. Imagine opening a project, you will see a docs folder that has the architecture, features, and changes documents. And each source code file contains a comment block about what it is for, how it works. These documents can help us understand the code base better.  
However, documentation is a difficult task. In fact, according to the Agile practices, due to time constraints, comprehensive documentation is sometimes sa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all heard it:
“It’s fine, unused code gets tree-shaken out.”
But here’s the truth…
Your bundle is lying to you.
tree-shaking isn't the silver bullet you think it is.
In this post, we’ll look at how tree-shaking really works, what gets left behind, and why your production bundle might be heavier than it needs to be — even when everything looks optimized.
Tree-shaking is a bundler optimization technique that removes unused exports from ES modules during bundling.
Example:
// utils.js
export function used() {}
export function unused() {}

If only used() is imported elsewhere, a good bundler will drop unused() from the final build.
Sounds great, right? So what’s the problem?
Many libraries contain side effects — things that run when the file is imported, even if nothing is used.

Whether you’re a complete beginner or coming from another programming language, learning Perl opens up a world of possibilities for text processing, automation, and rapid prototyping.
In this blog series, I’ll share my knowledge in Perl, highlighting the language’s unique features, practical tips, and the occasional quirk that makes Perl both powerful and fun. We’ll start with the basics—variables, control structures, and subroutines before diving into more advanced topics like regular expressions, modules, and object-oriented Perl.
Perl’s motto is “There’s more than one way to do it,” and you’ll soon discover just how flexible and expressive the language can be. Whether you want to automate tasks, manipulate data, or just explore a classic scripting language, Perl has something to offer.
The only prerequisite for following along is that you have Perl installed on your system. If you’re not sure, just type perl -v in your terminal to check.
If you are on a windows take a look at Strawberry perl
I look forward to sharing tips, examples, and insights that will help you get the most out of Perl. I hope in the end you’ll find this series both helpful and inspiring.]]></summary>
