It started out as an SDK on Guthub, but now its has become a cloud based API. AI has helped put it on the map for data extraction.
In an era where customer retention is more valuable than ever, loyalty rewards programs have become a cornerstone strategy for businesses looking to build lasting relationships. At the heart of many of these programs lies receipt scanning ‚Äî a process that must be accurate, fast, and scalable to provide a seamless user experience. This is where Tabscanner shines, setting itself apart as the best receipt OCR (Optical Character Recognition) API for loyalty rewards program software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In C#, the ref, out, and in keywords are used to pass arguments by reference to methods. This means that instead of passing a copy of the variable, a reference to the original variable is passed. However, these keywords serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors. Let's explore each one in detail.
Ref keyword 
Ref keyword is used to pass the value as a reference type inside a function and if it's changed inside a function, the value outside the function will also change since both points to the same address.
using System;
public class Program 
Output:
Out keyword
Out keyword is also very similar to ref keyword the only difference between both is,while passing it as an out keyword 
using System;
public class Program 
   Program p = new Program();
   p.Demofunc(out int a);
   Console.WriteLine("After calling the function "+a);
}

}

Output:
In keyword
In keyword is used to pass the value as a reference type but it's not possible to change the value inside the function,modifying the value within the function will cause a error with a message "Cannot assign to variable 'in int' because it is a readonly variable".
using System;
public class Program 
Output:
Before calling the function 10
Inside function 10
After calling the function 10]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone probably has a different definition, and depending on your perspective, the answer can vary. For influencers who use new AI features as part of their content, even if it has little to no practical value in the industry, the entertainment value alone can make it worthwhile.
But for professionals who have been working for years and are actually applying AI in their jobs, these things are essentially just advertising. It‚Äôs not that they have no value‚Äîit‚Äôs just a different perspective.
To me, even though the IT industry evolves rapidly, the things that fundamentally don‚Äôt change are what truly hold value.
For example:
Should we use AI to learn and improve work efficiency, or just dive into vibe coding, abandoning all the details‚Äîlike information security‚Äîand risk lawsuits and other consequences?
Truly valuable things always take time to learn and apply. They need to be internalized and become part of you, enabling you to solve real-world problems‚Äînot just show short-term, surface-level results.
In other words, the essence of AI is to raise everyone‚Äôs baseline capabilities, reduce repetitive tasks, and free up our attention for areas that are more meaningful. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äîor should‚Äîcompletely replace humans.
Rather than focusing solely on prompt engineering, we should prioritize communication and expression skills.
Lately, I‚Äôve been spending less time on social media to reduce meaningless anxiety. It's better to invest that time in exploring tools that are actually useful and learning how to use them effectively.]]></summary>

üõë In 2025, we completely ditched WordPress and CMS-based builds.
Instead, we now rely exclusively on Next.js + React + Firebase/Vercel.
‚ùå WordPress: Still "Easy", but Not Viable Anymore
Slow: heavy themes, plugin overload
Security holes: outdated plugins and brute-force bots
Plugin spaghetti: breaking updates, version conflicts
SEO pain: no server-side rendering (SSR), poor LCP/INP
Hidden costs: yearly theme/plugin fees + custom fixes
üëâ Your ‚Äúfree‚Äù CMS can easily cost more than a modern stack within 12‚Äì18 months.
‚úÖ The Tech We Use: Next.js + React + Firebase
Next.js ‚Üí SSG, SSR, fast routing
React.js ‚Üí Reusable components, dynamic UI
Firebase or Supabase ‚Üí Backend, auth, DB
Vercel ‚Üí Serverless deploys, edge caching
Tailwind + shadcn/ui ‚Üí Accessible, modern UI
üì¶ Fully typed (TypeScript), tested, SEO-optimized, scalable.
‚ö° Why Clients Love It (Even if They Don‚Äôt Know the Stack)
No plugin updates or maintenance headaches
Pages indexed in minutes, not days
Smoother UX = higher conversion
Hosting = basically free with Vercel
MVPs or full platforms can ship in days ‚Äî not months.
üî• Real Client Results (France, 2024‚Äì2025)
Volets Grand Est ‚Üí Bounce rate ‚Üì 35%, conversion ‚Üë 80%
Opera for a Night ‚Üí +65% average session duration
Our own site ‚Üí reactive-tech-solutions.com
üß† Why It Works (Even for Non-Tech Clients)
SSR + static export = perfect for SEO
Firebase/Auth = fast secure forms & backend
React components = scale as you grow
We don‚Äôt fight plugins. We ship results.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein‚Äôs contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization‚Äôs transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world‚Äôs largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn‚Äôt suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Though it‚Äôs not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent‚Äôs behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating.

Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin‚Äôs price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin‚Äôs price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801.

So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific‚Äôs shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he‚Äôs using a similar strategy ‚Äî this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.
Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin‚Äôs price keeps rising.
This week‚Äôs Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.

In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution.¬†

Short-term Bitcoin holders realized $11.6 billion in profit over the past 30 days, suggesting a potential pause or local top in the market.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market "breather."
Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,0‚Ä¶]]></summary>
