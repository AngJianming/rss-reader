Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator
Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative.
Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The call stack is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that plays a crucial role in the execution of code. Whether you're a beginner or aiming to deepen your understanding of how JavaScript operates under the hood, learning how the call stack works is essential to writing efficient and bug-free code.
This article explores what the call stack is, how it works, and how to interpret common errors related to it.
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of function invocations in a program. Since JavaScript is a single-threaded language, it can execute only one command at a time. The call stack manages the order in which functions are called and ensures that the program returns to the correct location after each function completes execution.
In technical terms, the call stack operates…]]></summary>

This post describes some best practices to avoid the most common performance bottlenecks that occur in React applications.
Understanding why a React component updates (re-renders) is crucial for performance optimization, as unnecessary updates are one of the most common sources of poor performance.
By default, whether a component update is necessary is decided using a referential equality check (see explanations below).
Primitives (e.g. string, number, boolean, undefined, null) get compared by value 1:
const str1 = "A";
const str2 = "A";
const str3 = "B";
console.log(str1 === str1); // true
console.log(str1 === str2); // true
console.log(str1 === str3); // false

Objects, arrays and functions by reference 1:
const obj1 = { a: "A", b: "B" };
const obj2 = { a: "A", b: "B" }…]]></summary>

What if you could test, tweak, and share UI components in isolation, without spinning up your entire app?
That’s exactly what Storybook enables.

Let’s understand it using a simple real-world analogy.
🏬 Think of your Web App as a Shopping Mall
Inside, you have:
Modals (Changing Rooms),
Buttons (Mannequins),
Forms (Checkout Counters),
Navigation Bars (Security Staff), and so on.
Now, let’s say you’re designing a button. Do you really want to:
Log in,
Navigate 3 pages deep...
👗 Enter Storybook — The Component Dressing Room
✅ See it in action
Step-by-Step Example: Using Storybook in React + TypeScript with a Button Component
npx storybook@latest init

This will:
Step 2: Create a Simple Button Component
src/components/Button.tsx
export const Button = ({ label, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) => {
Step 3: Create the Storybook Story for This Component
src/components/Button.stories.tsx
`import { Button } from './Button';
export default {
export const Primary = () => ;
export const Disabled = () => ;
Step 4: Run Storybook
npm run storybook

Storybook will launch at:
http://localhost:6006
You’ll now see:
A "Components" section
Your Button component under it
"Primary" and "Disabled" states rendered and clickable]]></summary>

“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”
For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (…]]></summary>

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.
Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

According to the May 16 report, the measures include priority access to police emergency lines, home security assessments, and safety briefings from French law enforcement to ensure best practices are being followed.
France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau introduced the security measures as part of a broader effort to counter the recent wave of attacks.

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”
