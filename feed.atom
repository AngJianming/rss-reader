        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Serverless computing has revolutionized application development by abstracting infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on code. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the serverless space with a suite of compute offerings that cater to diverse needs. As of today, the primary serverless compute services are AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and AWS App Runner. These services enable developers to build scalable, cost-efficient applications without provisioning servers, with automatic scaling and pay-as-you-go pricing. This guide explores each service, their features, use cases, limitations, and how to choose the right one for your project, tailored for developers seeking clarity and practical insights.

To make that data meaningful, actionable, and ready for use (by humans or AI), we need data pipelines.
Whether you're building an analytics dashboard, powering a chatbot, or just making sure your backend can handle user inputs and external data smoothly, data pipelines are the behind-the-scenes workhorses that make it happen.
Let’s break down exactly what a pipeline is, why it’s useful, and how you can write one correctly—with a real-life example from a legal-tech app built in Next.js.

An untested alarm is not one you can trust
In this blog series, I will describe different ways you can test your monitoring, both metric and service monitoring, to be sure that it works as you want.
So, what will that entail? Well, you will need to break stuff—at least enough so that your alarms will trigger.
Testing monitoring can be time-consuming especially if you want to test real alarms. Usually, you don’t want to get notified for every spike on an EC2, but more if it persists over a set time. And checking if scheduled tasks work will require you to wait for the schedule to run.
Before we start going through different tests, I suggest you run these tests in a non-production acc…]]></summary>

Enable Opcode Caching


PHP executes code by compiling it to bytecode each time. Use OPcache (built into PHP 7+) to cache precompiled bytecode, eliminating repetitive compilation.
; php.ini
opcache.enable=1
opcache.enable_cli=1
opcache.memory_consumption=256

Optimize Database Queries




Index Columns: Ensure frequently queried columns are indexed.
Avoid SELECT *: Fetch only necessary fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to soon break past $100,000 and potentially hit a new all-time high as US President Donald Trump is set to announce a trade deal with the UK.
Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency passed Senate Bill 21 with no amendments on May 7 in a 9-4 vote along party lines. The bill has already passed the Texas Senate, in a 25-5 vote on March 6.  
SB 21 would establish the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” controlled by the state’s comptroller — currently Glenn Hegar — who would be permitted to invest in digital assets that have obtained a market cap of at least $500 billion over the last twelve months, which would currently only include Bitcoin (BTC).

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…]]></summary>

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

The ETH futures premium has remained below the 5% neutral threshold, indicating a lack of appetite from leveraged bulls. More significantly, this indicator was unchanged at 3% after the Pectra upgrade, suggesting traders did not adjust thei…]]></summary>

According to the onchain detective, the $45 million figure represents the latest financial losses in a string of social engineering scams targeting Coinbase users, which ZachXBT said is a problem unique among crypto exchanges:
"Over the past few months, I have reported on nine figures stolen from Coinbase users via similar social engineering scams. Interestingly, no other major exchange has the same problem."

Bessent addressed lawmakers at a May 7 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, saying that the United States should be the “premier destination for digital assets” in response to a question about American dominance over China in crypto-related innovation. The Treasury Secretary added that “good market structure” and “stablecoin legislation” could help ensure this outcome.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.
