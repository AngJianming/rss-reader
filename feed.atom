Introduced by Eric Evans in his influential book Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software (2003), DDD provides both strategic principles and tactical patterns that help teams create scalable, maintainable, and business-aligned software.
DDD encourages teams to focus on the business domain, the core area of knowledge and activity around which the business revolves. Rather than viewing software as just code or infrastructure, DDD promotes building software that mirrors and models real-world business processes and logic.
By understanding the domain deeply, developers can craft systems that are not only functional but also aligned with the needs and goals of the busin…]]></summary>

I had no idea what efi was and why there was such low disk volume on it, but it didn't sound positive, low anything never sounds positive.
So I did what any confused dev with no guru to guide them would do, I consulted the OG chatgpt! BUT WITH A BADASS PROMPT FROM aiforwork.co
To check the available space, I ran these commands:

This high-performance Rust HTTP framework fundamentally altered my view of web development. Here's a genuine account of my experience learning and using Hyperlane.
ctx Abstraction


When I first began using Hyperlane, I was immediately impressed by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. In other frameworks, I was accustomed to writing more verbose calls, such as:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

With Hyperlane, this simplifies to a single line:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

This design significantly boosts code readability, especially when handling complex business logic, by removing the need for deeply nested method calls.

What controls their brilliant coat colors? And what makes calico and tortoiseshell patterns so uniquely complex? Now, thanks to an international team of researchers from Stanford University and several Japanese institutions, the genetic puzzle has been solved.
The answer lies in a specific region of the cat’s X chromosome. Researchers have identified a deletion near a gene known as ARHGAP36, which they believe is responsible for turning off the production of brown and black pigments in the fur. This genetic quirk allows the red and yellow pigments to take over, giving orange cats their unmistakable coloring.
In male cats, who possess only one X c…]]></summary>

Started with writing something I'm calling "Excavation" - don't ask me what that means yet, but it felt necessary.
Then moved to Matplotlib and Seaborn. Made my first real graphs and honestly? This is the first time the whole thing felt legitimate instead of just following tutorials.
There's something about seeing data turn into visuals that makes it click. Like oh, this is what people mean when they talk about data storytelling.
Sklearn probably day after tomorrow. Curious to see how that jump feels compared to the visualization stuff.
Anyone else remember that moment when something abstract suddenly became real for them?]]></summary>
