At this year’s Android Show, Google teased its first Android XR sunglasses—complete with a tiny camera lens—and announced that I/O 2025 attendees will get hands-on time with the new form factor. Live prototypes so far have clear lenses for everyday indoor/outdoor use, and press demos in December plus an April on-stage reveal have only whetted appetites.
Biggest audience yet (but don’t expect a launch)

I/O will be the broadest demo push yet as Google hypes up its AR ambitions, though there’s no firm release date. Android XR is slated to debut on headsets (think Samsung later this year) with Gemini-powered updates, and developers can expect fresh SDK news at the conference—pricing and full specs are still TBD.]]></summary>

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.

“Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.”
McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures.

Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.

Synthetix said in a May 14 blog post that it plans to acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million. 
The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.
Derive originally launched as Lyra in 2021, having spun out from the Synthetix ecosystem. Synthetix said the acquisition is part of a broader strategy that includes…]]></summary>

The Bangkok Post reported on May 13 that Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a briefing after the cabinet endorsed the plan. He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months.
The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.
“One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in go…]]></summary>

A brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, was foiled after the daughter and passersby reportedly fought off the kidnappers.
Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.
The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by "risk-on" sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.
