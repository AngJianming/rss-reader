Bitcoin whales are adding to their BTC positions while price ranges below all-time highs.

If a new market correction comes, one potential bounce level lies in the mid-$90,000 zone.

Hyperliquid trader James Wynn hints at large-volume traders shaping low-timeframe price performance.

Bitcoin (BTC) may only see support at $94,000 if a fresh BTC price correction ensues, new analysis says this week.
In its latest X commentary, Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, pointed to a Bitcoin bounce zone at the 21-week moving average.

Bitcoin whales jump in amid “consolidating” price

For years, the tough-it-out culture among tradies meant mental wellbeing often took a backseat. But times are changing.

Like any digital asset, your WordPress site requires regular care and attention to ensure it performs optimally, stays secure, and delivers a seamless experience for visitors. Ignoring basic maintenance tasks can lead to issues like slow loading speeds, outdated content, broken links, security vulnerabilities, and even complete site crashes.
One of the most critical tasks in your WordPress maintenance plan is regularly backing up your website. Backups ensure that you can restore your site to a previous version without losing valuable data in case of a crash, hack, or accidental deletion.
Best Practices:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most effective ways to learn Java is through hands-on projects. Creating a simple to-do list application helps beginners not only grasp basic Java syntax but also enhances their understanding of graphical interfaces, object-oriented programming, and simple data storage. This article explains how to build a basic to-do list app step by step using Java.
Project Overview
Preparation
Task Structure Design
User Interface Design
After a user inputs a task and clicks the "Add" button, the task is added to the list. Clicking on a task and then pressing "Delete" removes it, while clicking "Complete" changes its status. These actions are managed through event listeners, and the task display updates in real time based on user interaction.
Program Logic and Interaction
To improve usability, the app can be enhanced to save tasks to a local file and automatically load them when the application starts. This feature ensures users won’t lose their tasks after closing the app and can be implemented using Java’s file I/O classes.
Conclusion
Building a simple Java to-do list application is a great way to practice core programming skills such as object-oriented design, event handling, GUI development, and data manipulation. Although this is a small project, it effectively demonstrates how Java can be used to build desktop applications. If you wish to expand the functionality, you can add features like task categories, due dates, or priority levels to create a more powerful task manager.]]></summary>

Most AWS architects and developers create and use IAM roles but do not understand how the permissions described in the policies attached to a role are assigned to principals. The permissions assigned to the principal are always temporary and short-lived. These short-lived credentials are generated by AWS Security Token Service (STS), but wait – what ensures that the right principals assume a role? In this article we will look at AWS Trust Policy, the security gatekeeper that ensures that the right principal can assume a role to perform its actions.

It was a chilly Tuesday morning. I pushed what I thought was a “harmless” update to a legacy payment module—half-commented in a language no one speaks anymore (possibly Elvish?). An hour later, our production server began throwing errors like it was auditioning for a disaster movie.
That’s the day I truly understood why code quality and automated testing matter. And that’s the day I almost fled tech to become a barista.
Code quality is like personal hygiene—if you don’t maintain it, things get gross fast. Sure, it technically still works, but no one wants to be near it.
Great code is readable, maintainable, testable, and doesn’t make the next developer cry. Bad code? You’ll know it. It’s the kind with 12 nested if statements, variables named x1 through x7, a…]]></summary>

Now we build MVPs to maybe survive the quarter.
This isn’t a post about how everything used to be better. It’s just an observation — and maybe a quiet protest — about how easy it is to confuse activity for progress when the rituals of delivery become more important than the value delivered.
Somewhere along the way, we started measuring the number of tickets closed instead of whether anything actually got better.
We replaced architecture with story points.
We replaced meaningful iteration with ceremonies so performative they deserve their own Oscars category.
We got really good at “velocity” and forgot that shipping garbage faster is not the same as improvement.
“Deliver working software.”

Remember that one? It used to be a principle.
Now it’s just something you hear right before someone tells you they’re rewriting a service because the old one was written in the “wrong” language.
I’m not saying waterfall was better.

I’m saying we’ve swung too far the other way.
Where once we spent six months planning a login form, now we spend six months pretending not to plan anything — and somehow end up with three frontends, five services, and nothing reusable.
Every generation of devs thinks they’re the first to see the mess.

But we’ve been here before. And we’ll be here again. The best we can do is notice it earlier, name it honestly, and maybe do a little less damage next time.

Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

“Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin who chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27.
“We have to restrain ourselves from that instinct and attempt by our colleagues — both sides of the aisle,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey’s financial services firm Block, Inc. will launch Bitcoin payments on Square, its payments processing arm, with a rollout to begin later this year before a full launch in 2026.
The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.
Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

“The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3,” Bitfinex analysts said in a May 28 markets note.
Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy”
Bitcoin (BTC) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22; however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

Both regulatory filings are needed for the Sui (SUI) tracking fund to go live, with the 19b-4 filing kicking off the SEC’s review process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.
According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. 
He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time…]]></summary>

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.”
In March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months
The level in question is the mid-line (~$2,600) of the Gaussian Channel — a moving average-based band that tracks long-term momentum — on the 2-week chart.

XRP derivatives markets turn bearish amid reducing institutional demand, suggesting further downside for XRP price.

XRP’s descending triangle breakout could lead to a decline toward $1.96.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 45% since April 7 lows to trade at $2.31 on May 27. But the price remains 31% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns about XRP’s ability to rise higher.
