Let’s be honest, if your website doesn’t have a strategy behind it, it’s not going to do much for your business. So let’s go through the these steps to build a web strategy that actually works.
Think about it this way: a website is something you have to pay for. But a website with a clear, well-executed strategy behind it? That’s something that pays for itself — again and again — by bringing in new customers. But that only happens if you get it right.
One of the biggest mistakes I see companies make is this. When it’s time to redo their website, they start thinking in terms of a redesign. So they go out and hire a web designer, who may or may not do any real discovery work to put a strategy in p…]]></summary>

It’s 2 AM. I’m sitting in my kitchen, code editor glowing, debugging the 47th version of a real-time dashboard that’s supposed to update instantly. Instead, it refreshes like it’s being powered by a sleepy tortoise using dial-up. My cat is judging me. I’m judging myself.
And that’s when it hit me: if you’re not building your web apps to be 5G-ready, you’re basically preparing them to be outdated by the time your coffee finishes brewing.
Let’s talk about it. And yes, I brought snacks.
Let’s get one thing straight: “5G-ready” doesn’t mean your site looks nice on mobile. We are well past that, my friend.

使用 Record 与 ESObject 定义未知对象类型
递归打印未知类型对象的key
在鸿蒙应用开发中，所有的数据都必须定义类型，且不存在 any 类型，那么我们当遇到 key 值可能随时变化的情况时，如何获取该 object 中每一个 key 对应的数据呢？
本期以如下 object 为例，下方对象报文可能会根据使用时间或服务商的变化，"153" 字段可能会变成 "278" 等未知字符串、"5G" 字段可能会变成 "4G"，那么当 key 值不断变化的同时应如何获取 "isShow" 字段的 "Y" 值？
"cfg": {
  "153": {
    "5G": {
      "isShow": "Y"
    }
  }
}

在鸿蒙中，已经不支持索引签名的类型写法（如：[key: string]: string | number），所以需要使用提供的 Record 与 ESObject 类型，在复杂类型场景使用，所以我们可以直接嵌套定义如下类型即可。
type objType = Record<string, Record<string, Record<string, Record<string, string>>>>
let obj: objType = {
  "cfg": {
    "153": {
      "5G": {
        "isShow": "Y"
      }
    }
  }
}

注：其他明确 key 与 value 类型的场景不建议使用 Record 与 ESObject 类型，养成良好开发习惯，标注好对应数据类型。
鸿蒙中不支持 for... in 形式的打印，所以对于该种复杂嵌套对象，我们可以自行编写简单的 for 循环，递归调用即可。
/**
 * 打印对象所有的 key
 * @param obj
 */
handleKey(obj: objType | string) {
  let keys = Object.keys(obj);
  for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
    console.log("luvi > " + keys[i]);
    if (typeof obj[keys[i]] === "object") {
      this.handleKey(obj[keys[i]])
      continue
    }
    // 打印 isShow 最终值
    if (keys[i] === "isShow") {
      console.log("luvi > isShow最终值：" + obj[keys[i]]);
      break
    }
  }
}

// 调用
this.handleKey(obj)

输出结果：

该篇文章为开发时临时记录，开发经验如上，若对 TS 基础类型写法存在疑惑可查看 TS 官方文档，Record 与 ESObject 类型为鸿蒙的 ArkTS 类型，详细用法可前往 HarmonyOS 开发者官网了解。

With this one question, recruiters want to quickly find out:
Do you really have the right skills and experience for this role?
Are you motivated and trustworthy?
Can you adapt and fit into the team and company?
And most importantly: how do you deal with challenges and problems?
Briefly say who you are, what your expertise is, and how you got here.

Most websites rely on basic defenses:

Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon’ to US: CFTC’s Mersinger
Outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger said on May 22 that the regulator could greenlight crypto perpetual futures contracts “very soon.”
“We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she told Bloomberg TV, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.”

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.
Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.

Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him…]]></summary>

According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.

The SEC’s decision on a spot XRP ETF could ignite a significant rally.

The current $2.2 billion in XRP futures hints at growing institutional investor demand.

The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP (XRP) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States' “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a years-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique crypto…]]></summary>

Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets.  
Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours.
