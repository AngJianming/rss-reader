With the rise of AI tools for developers, we're not just changing how code is written—we're witnessing a transformation in who writes code, what skills are in demand, and how developers create value. For many in tech, it’s an exciting yet unsettling time.
For years, programmers enjoyed high salaries thanks to a strong demand for software and a shortage of qualified talent. But that’s starting to change.
Recent data reveals stagnating or declining salaries for entry-level and mid-level developers. At the same time, AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are now capable of producing clean, functional code for increasingly complex tasks. This raises an urgent question: Will AI replace coders?

Neste artigo, vamos explorar o conceito de Middlewares no contexto de APIs .NET, entender como eles funcionam e ver exemplos práticos de como utilizá-los.
O que são Middlewares?
Middlewares são componentes que formam o pipeline de processamento de requisições em uma aplicação .NET. Eles são responsáveis por lidar com solicitações HTTP (requests) e respostas HTTP (responses), permitindo executar lógicas antes e depois que uma requisição chegue ao seu endpoint final.
Pense em um middleware como uma "camada" que a requisição passa antes de chegar ao seu destino (e também na volta, quando a resposta é enviada ao cliente).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I completed General Assembly’s Web Developer Immersive in 2016. Back then, the curriculum focused on Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, raw Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node). At the time, everything moved at breakneck speed—and while we covered a lot, I don’t think the fundamentals ever had time to really sink in.
What I did admire was the program’s emphasis on building and deploying projects. You were thrown into the deep end—forced to wrestle with unfamiliar concepts and figure things out as you built. Pre-LLM, that approach made sense. You just pushed through and got something working. Whether that led to long-term understanding, though, was a different story.
It wasn’t until I enrolled in CSMC 203: Introduction to Programming at Montgomery College that things finally began to click. That foundational class helped me breeze through CSMC 206: Python Programming, and from there, everything felt more grounded.
Eventually, I transferred to the University of Illinois Chicago to finish my CS degree. Being at a large public university, many professors rely on autograders to evaluate code. Imagine your first programming project being run through HackerRank or LeetCode-style tests without ever really being shown how to solve a problem. It’s easy to see how that could be discouraging—maybe even enough to push someone out of the field entirely.
And UIC? They pile on the homework, especially in the engineering department.
There isn’t much space to breathe, let alone learn deeply, until the semester ends. I’ve been balancing work and school for a while now, and I finally have the time and mental bandwidth to prove what I’m capable of—not as a cog in an assembly line, but as a developer who builds with intention.
Over the coming months, I plan to build and share 12 projects that demonstrate why I’m a senior developer—and why I’m qualified for just about any role I apply to.]]></summary>

Here's an overview of the progression from plain text passwords to using Secure Remote Password (SRP) and the key concepts at each stage:
Plain Text Passwords: In the early days of computing and network authentication, passwords were often stored in plain text on servers. This means that when a user entered their password, it was stored exactly as entered. The main problem with plain text storage is that if the server is compromised, attackers can easily obtain the passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

But as someone who’s been through the DSA gauntlet and come out the other side, I’m starting to question: Are we filtering for the right kind of talent?
DSA isn’t the enemy—it’s a useful tool. But when it becomes the only lens for evaluating engineers, we risk missing out on builders, pragmatists, and innovators who don’t shine in 90-minute coding puzzles. Let’s rethink how we hire and what we’re optimizing for.

Bitcoin price fell 1.4% to $102,460 amid US economic concerns, with daily trading volume up 94%, indicating the return of sellers.

Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.
Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.
Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.

The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.
In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18.
Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.
