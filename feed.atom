Apple has significantly expanded the App Store Connect API with several long-awaited features that promise to streamline app development workflows. The new additions focus on automation and real-time notifications, helping developers iterate faster and respond more quickly to user feedback.
Webhooks API: The biggest addition is webhook support, which replaces the need for constant polling with push notifications. Instead of repeatedly asking App Store Connect for updates, your server now receives automatic notifications when important events occur. This event-driven approach is far more efficient and enables real-time responses to app state changes.

Apple has announced significant updates to the App Store server APIs for In-App Purchase, designed to simplify and enhance app server responsibilities. These improvements focus on three critical areas: managing In-App Purchases, signing requests, and participating in refund decisions.
Bottom Line: These updates provide developers with more flexible transaction management, unified signing processes, and simplified refund handling—making In-App Purchase integration more powerful and developer-friendly than ever.
The most significant addition is the appTransactionId, a globally unique identifier for each Apple Account per app. Unlike existing transaction IDs that are purchase-specific, this identifier:

The breakthrough lies in Containerization's architecture. Instead of running all containers within a single large VM, each container gets its own dedicated lightweight virtual machine. This approach delivers several advantages:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[动态规划（Dynamic Programming，简称DP）是一种用于解决最优化问题的算法思想，适用于可以将问题分解为子问题，且子问题之间有重叠的情况。
动态规划的核心思想是：
将原问题分解为子问题，先解决子问题并保存结果（记忆化），然后再组合这些子问题的解，从而得到原问题的解。
与分治算法的区别：
分治：子问题互不重叠；
动态规划：子问题重叠，因此可以通过保存子问题结果（记忆）来节省计算时间。
确定状态


找出问题可以由哪些子问题表示。
确定状态转移方程


即找到当前状态如何从其他状态转移过来。
确定初始状态


通常是数组的第0位，或者空背包时的值。
确定遍历顺序


根据依赖关系选择从前向后，或从后向前。
返回结果


根据题意返回结果：可能是dp[n]、dp[n][m]、或是max(dp[i])等等。



类型
典型题目
简要描述




线性DP
198. 打家劫舍
从一排房子中选不能相邻的最大收益


背包DP
416. 分割等和子集
判断是否能分成和相等的两个子集


区间DP
312. 戳气球
最优戳气球顺序


子序列DP
300. 最长递增子序列
找出最长递增子序列


编辑距离
72. 编辑距离
最少操作使两个字符串相同



比如你遇到一个LeetCode题目，看不出是不是DP，怎么办？
是否有“最值”（最大/最小）或者“方案数”？
如果是：可能适合DP。
例：“最多能抢多少钱”、“最少多少次操作”、“有多少种方法到终点”。
问题是否可以分解为子问题？
比如：“我只需要知道前i个的解，就能推出第i+1个”。
子问题是否重叠？
如果递归中重复计算了相同子问题，说明可以用DP优化。

The experience has been nothing short of exciting and engaging. The few challenges encountered only made the journey more interesting and rewarding.
Introduction to Excel
Real-World Applications of Excel in Data Analysis
Essential Excel Features for Data Analysis
Personal Reflection
Learning Excel has fundamentally transformed how I perceive data. Where I once saw overwhelming spreadsheets filled with numbers, I now see stories waiting to be told. Working with Excel has taught me that effective data analysis combines technical proficiency with creative problem-solving.
I have come to realize that, similar to playing music, data has rhythm, patterns, and relationships. Just as musical compositions follow certain structures and harmonies, data follows patterns that can be discovered and interpreted. This parallel between music and data analysis has made the learning process more intuitive and enjoyable for me.
The ability to transform raw information into meaningful insights feels remarkably similar to creating music – both require understanding underlying structures, recognizing patterns, and presenting information in a way that resonates with the audience. This realization has not only enhanced my analytical skills but has also deepened my appreciation for the artistry involved in data analysis.
This newfound understanding has built my anticipation to continue learning about data analysis and exploring more advanced Excel features. The journey has shown me that data analysis is not just about numbers and formulas but about discovering the stories that data tells and using those insights to make informed decisions in our increasingly data-driven world.]]></summary>

This is the story of how I built my very first game using Amazon Q CLI. It’s called Exam Hunters, and it’s inspired by something every student knows all too well: the chaos and clarity that comes right before exams.
💡Why I Made Exam Hunters
🧠 AI as a Co-Creator: Prompting with Purpose
Amazon Q CLI for the challenge, and it quickly became more than a tool—it was my pair-programmer. Here are some of the techniques that worked really well:
Contextual prompting: Telling Q what the game should feel like, not just what the function should do, gave better results—especially for narrative flow.
Iterative layering: I built logic and design layer by layer, refining earlier outputs instead of starting over each time.
Creative role prompting: Asking Q to “think like a game narrative designer” or “help me balance game mechanics” unlocked smarter, more intuitive ideas.
🔄 Blending Logic with Emotion
It defined function-based gameplay logic structures.
Simultaneously, it assisted in brainstorming emotionally charged status updates and closings.
This concern allowed me to remain in the context of the game, rather than syntax.
🐞 Debugging with Backup
💬 Continuing the Conversation with Q CLI

🧘‍♀️ Final Thoughts
"Every project teaches us something—this one reminded me how much AI can enhance creativity. If you’re working on something that excites you, keep pushing forward!"]]></summary>
