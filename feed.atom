        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaway:

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asset tokenization is set to accelerate the movement of capital across traditional markets, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Nazarov said the shift will boost capital velocity in asset classes such as treasuries, equities, private credit, commercial debt, and real estate.
"I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily," Nazarov said on May 14. 
The remarks came on the same day Chainlink announced a partnership with Kinexys, a blockchain network for institutional-grade tokenized assets by JP Morgan, and digital asset firm Ondo Fi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, what is it like to have tinnitus? I would say, in short, it sucks. It’s a piece of quality of life that has been lost and you never experience absolute silence again.
Can you live with it? Yes!
Can you work as a software developer with it? Yes, of course!
But it has to be said, a constant, persistent beep is a distraction, especially when a deep focus on a task is needed.
I would like to make a few points about how I deal with this, especially when developing software.
The first (perhaps most important for me) step in dealing with this was acceptance. In the beginning I felt shame, anger and even fear. However, with the acceptance of this new fact, it got better and my head was clearer again.
I looked for nice, relaxing sounds and played them in the background. The beeping is always there, so why not cover it up with something beautiful that you like and brings you joy, I thought to myself. There are countless playlists for all kinds of sounds on the streaming platforms, such as nature and night rain.
I take regular breaks and rest my body and mind during this time. In my opinion, a working day, however stressful it may be, should have at least one longer lunch break with fresh air (I’m still working on this). Nevertheless, the lunch break is an integral part of every situation where I don’t think about work for 30 minutes and recharge my batteries.
I have already set up my workstation ergonomically. Of course, there’s always room for more. A desk that can be raised and lowered is a great thing. Correct posture is extremely important. I’m still at the beginning in this area and am always looking at where I can improve.
Ok ok I know, admittedly sounds, pauses and ergonomics aren’t big new pro tips. I would rather like to say that this impairment loses its power when you exhaust all other possibilities and start optimizing. You should concentrate on the things you can influence and make the best of them!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In cache design, we often encounter a troublesome problem: a large number of “invalid queries” put tremendous pressure on the database. For example, when a user requests data that doesn’t exist, we typically query the database, which returns “not found.” If there are many such requests, the database gets busy handling these meaningless queries, affecting system performance. So, is there a way to know in advance whether data “might exist” before querying? This is where Bloom filters come into play.
Imagine the following scenario:
Our system has a cache layer (Redis) and a database layer (MySQL).
When a user requests some data, we first check the cache. If it’s a cache hit, we return the result directly.
If the data isn’t in the cache, we query the database. If the database doesn’t have it e…]]></summary>

Understanding CoCreateInstance
CoCreateInstance is a function used to create an instance of a COM object. It takes several parameters, including the CLSID of the object you want to create, the IID of the interface you want to use, and the location type (whether you want a singleton or an apartment model).

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

Bitcoin's 36% rebound from $74,500 runs into resistance at $106,000.

Bid-side liquidity is staking up on the downside near $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 36% from its April 9, five-month low at $74,500. However, its failure to decisively break above $106,000 has sparked concerns about whether a sharp correction is possible in the coming days.

Bitcoin’s recent break above $105,000 saw its price rise above the short-term holder realized price as this cohort of traders flipped some of their unrealized losses into profit.

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks. To understand the potential impact on Bitcoin, let’s examine four key periods of significant spot ETF activity and their correlation with BTC pri…]]></summary>

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…]]></summary>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…]]></summary>

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.

On May 15, blockchain data showed that Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), into the Tron network. 
As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s. 
In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion.

“I’m seeing a lot of brands rethinking where revenue and fan engagement come from,” Kahn said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “A lot of franchises, like the ones we work with — NBA, NFL, Disney — have already had years of success with digital collection, and we’re seeing a lot of brands express interest in digital collectibles as a way to engage with fan bases at a time when physical costs are riskier and unknown.”

On this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls “Bitcoin Season 2.”

Bitcoin beyond money
“Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,” said Duke. 
“What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”
New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value.

Bitcoin’s price is retracing, but strong ETF inflows, high network activity and whale accumulation suggest BTC is on track to $140,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.9 billion in net inflows in two weeks, mirroring past rallies.

Declining exchange balances and a rising transaction volume Z-score suggest increasing overall demand.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was down 1.4% over the last 24 hours. It traded 6% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached on Jan. 20. Nevertheless, several fundamental, onchain and technical metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upside is not over.

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.

The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDS, which are then held as collateral.
The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants, Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.

Lawmakers are reportedly working on a Bitcoin (BTC) national reserve proposal, with a draft bill in its final stages, according to Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the plan to local media outlet Incrypted.
The proposal was announced during the CRYPTO 2025 conference in Kyiv on Feb. 6. “We will soon submit a draft law from the industry allowing the creation of crypto reserves,” Zhelezniak said.
Cointelegraph reached out to Zhelezniak for comment on the bill’s status but had not received a response by publication.
