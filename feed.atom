Imagine it’s a Monday morning. The sun peeks through your window blinds, and your to-do list glares back at you—a tangled jumble of tickets, meetings, and half-finished side projects. You sip your coffee and wonder: “How will I actually get deep, uninterrupted work done this week?”
That was me (Hi, I am HyungWoo, you can call me Eric), a software engineer buried under an avalanche of context switches. I loved Linear for tracking issues, but it lived in its own world. Google Calendar managed my meetings, but had no idea about my development tasks. Worse, every time I estimated a card in Linear, reality laughed in my face when I discovered I’d actually spent twice the time. Weekends blurred into evenings of “catch-up” work, and burnout loomed on the horizon.

Here's what I tackled:
Pattern Matching:

Let's dive into how these concepts are elevating my Rust code, and how my AI assistant is evolving into an even smarter partner in this learning process.

When we left off in Part 1, I had built what I thought was a pretty solid multi-threaded TCP server. It handled multiple connections, had proper cleanup, and even graceful shutdown. I was feeling pretty good about myself until I ran some basic load tests and watched my beautiful creation crumble like a house of cards in a hurricane.
The problem wasn't bugs in my code - it was the fundamental architecture. My thread-per-connection model hit a wall around 200 concurrent connections, and it wasn't even close to graceful degradation. The server didn't slow down - it just started rejecting connections entirely. Memory usage was through the roof, and CPU was spending more time switching between threads th…]]></summary>

前言
在运动类应用中，能够快速导入和分析其他应用的运动记录是一个极具吸引力的功能。这不仅为用户提供便利，还能增强应用的实用性和吸引力。本文将结合鸿蒙（HarmonyOS）开发实战经验，深入解析如何实现一个运动记录选择与上传功能，让运动数据的管理更加高效。
一、为什么需要运动记录上传功能
运动记录上传功能允许用户将其他应用（如 Keep）的运动数据导入到我们的应用中进行分析和管理。这不仅可以丰富我们的应用数据，还能为用户提供更全面的运动分析和建议。此外，通过上传功能，用户可以轻松备份和同步他们的运动记录，无论何时何地都能查看自己的运动历史。
二、核心功能实现
1.文件选择
为了实现文件选择功能，我们使用了鸿蒙的DocumentViewPickerAPI。以下是文件选择的核心代码：
async selectFile() {
  if (this.isLoading) return;

  this.isLoading = true;
  try {
    let context = getContext(this) as common.Context; // 请确保getContext(this)返回结果为UIAbilityContext
    let documentPicker = new picker.DocumentViewPicker(context);
    let documentSelectOptions = new picker.DocumentSelectOptions();
    // 选择文档的最大数目（可选）
    documentSelectOptions.maxSelectNumber = 1;
    // 选择文件的后缀类型['后缀类型描述|后缀类型']（可选…]]></summary>

We certainly did. Our team had been working on a relatively complex Node.js backend powering APIs for a client-facing web dashboard. But no matter how many unit tests we wrote or code reviews we did, strange issues kept creeping into production.
Then, we made a small but powerful change: we introduced one middleware function. It didn’t refactor our logic or change any major architecture. It simply caught what was already there—errors hiding in plain sight. To our surprise, that one middleware fixed over 90% of our runtime bugs.
