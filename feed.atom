I’m continuing my 30-Day Linux Challenge as part of my preparation for the RHCSA exam and today I’m focusing on something super simple; yet incredibly useful in any Linux environment: checking who you are in the system.
In Linux, knowing which user you are, which groups you belong to and what permissions that gives you is the first step to understanding your access and control. That’s where commands like id, whoami, and groups come in.
These might seem basic at first glance but they’re powerful tools, especially when you’re troubleshooting permissions or setting up access for teams.

Merchants with a Shopify Plus plan can start utilizing this integration today by setting up Clerk as an identity provider (IdP) in the Shopify admin console.
With Clerk’s platform, Shopify merchants can:
Support social sign-in options - preferred by 53% of users and proven to convert 1.3x faster than passwords
Enable passkey authentication, allowing customers to securely log in using device biometrics or PINs - eliminating forgotten passwords and preventing credential stuffing attacks
Enhance security with MFA, blocking 99.9% of account takeover attempts
Offload session management, taking advantage of features like active device monitoring and instant session revocation for improved security
Unify authentication across multiple storefronts and external apps, simplifying management and supporting business expansion
We’re thrilled to bring Clerk’s authentication capabilities to Shopify’s ecosystem, and we can’t wait to see how merchants use these tools to create secure, frictionless shopping experiences.

We present SpectralCentroidTransformer (SCT), a neuroscience-inspired architecture that models language by decomposing the process into oscillatory components and semantic clustering, mirroring established theories of neural information processing. Our architecture separates the language modeling task into two distinct phases: (1) mapping input context to semantically meaningful locations in embedding space via spectral transformations; and (2) interpreting these locations in relation to learned conceptual centroids to produce token distributions. We demonstrate through rigorous experimentation that this approach not only achieves competitive performance on standard NLP benchmarks but also creates more interpretable and robust representations of linguistic concepts.

Website speed is crucial, not just for keeping visitors happy, but also for ranking well on search engines. One way to speed up your site’s performance is by using a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN can be a game-changer for WordPress sites, especially if you’re running a blog or an online store where load time matters.
A CDN works by distributing your content across a network of servers, ensuring that your website loads faster for users regardless of where they’re located. In this article, we’ll dive into the basics of CDNs, why they’re essential for WordPress, and how you can integrate one with your site to boost performance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Spring Framework provides several bean scopes that determine the lifecycle and visibility of beans in the application context:
Singleton
Prototype
Request
Session
Application
WebSocket
The last four scopes (request, session, application, and WebSocket) are specifically designed for web applications.
A session-scoped bean in Spring is a bean that is created once per HTTP session and shared across multiple requests from the same user. It remains active until the session expires or is invalidated.
Session-scoped beans are useful for storing temporary, user-specific data.
1. User ID : If a user ID is used across multiple HTTP requests, it's better to store it in the session scoped bean rather than querying the database on every request.
2. theme : If the application supports multiple UI themes, the user’s theme preference can be stored in a session-scoped bean to maintain consistency across all requests.
3. User Roles : Once authenticated, the user's roles can be stored in a session-scoped bean for quick access during subsequent requests.
4. language : User's language preferences (locale) can be stored in a session-scoped bean to maintain a consistent user experience across all requests.
Lifecycle
Created when a new HTTP session starts (e.g., user logs in).
Destroyed when the session expires (timeout, logout, or invalidation).
Each user gets their own instance.
Use Cases
Storing user-specific data (e.g., shopping cart, authentication details).
Maintaining state across multiple requests (e.g., user preferences).
Avoiding repeated database fetches for session-related data.
I noticed many beginners struggle with @SessionScope in Spring. After researching, I made:

But now your workflows look like a YAML junkyard. Duplicate code everywhere. Jobs that take 3 hours to run. And don’t get me started on maintaining 12 repos with the same CI steps.  
What if I told you GitHub Actions has superpowers to declutter your workflows, slash build times, and make you the DevOps hero your team needs? Let’s dive into reusable workflows, matrix jobs, and custom actions—the trio that’ll transform your CI/CD from “it works” to “it’s chef’s kiss.”  
1. Reusable Workflows: Stop Copy-Pasting YAML


The Problem:

You’ve got 10 repos, each with the same “deploy-to-AWS” job. When AWS updates their CLI,…]]></summary>

Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT (USDT), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto was born from an open-source ethos, where code was shared publicly, accessible for review and shaped by community contributions. Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.
But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mantra has called for industry-wide cooperation to reduce investor risks in the aftermath of its OM token crash.
On April 30, Mantra published its latest update since the sudden collapse of its OM token, claiming that the incident was “bigger than Mantra.”
“Liquidation cascades could happen to any project in the crypto industry,” Mantra CEO John Mullin warned in the post, pointing to the role of “aggressive leverage positions” on exchanges as a broader threat to investor safety.
