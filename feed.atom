When you're building blazingly fast WASM apps, there's one thing that silently makes or breaks the user experience: loading states. We've all been there, blank screens, layout jumps, etc. It's not just bad UX. It's lost trust.
That's why we're excited today to introduce Skeleton RS , a highly-configurable skeleton loader built natively for Rust WASM frameworks, starting with full Yew support. Think of it as a smart placeholder for your content , one that speaks fluent WASM.
Let's unpack why Skeleton RS is your new best friend when it comes to loading UIs 🦴.

Skeleton RS is a high-performance skeleton loader component designed for frontend Rust frameworks like Yew. Whether you're fetching data, lazy-loading routes, or animating components into view, Skeleton RS gives you gracef…]]></summary>

It's day 10 of building an AI Model & I've finally progressed to a level in my AI Building Journey that it's made me convinced I can finally announce something.
I've named the model KARL-AI. The acronym, when expanded fully, acknowledges the foundation logic the model is built upon, which will be shortly introduced.
I've started the documentation for the model in parallel with coding. That should be good news, you'll get to read everything about it before watching it in action.

That's where DDD (Domain-Driven Design) and TDD (Test-Driven Development) shine as complementary approaches. In this article, I'll show you how to combine them in a project using NestJS with modern best practices.
Domain-Driven Design is a software development philosophy that focuses on the business domain. Instead of forcing the domain to fit the code, we adapt the code to represent the domain.
Key components of DDD:
Entities: Objects with identity (e.g., a User).
Value Objects: Objects without identity, defined by their attributes (Email, Money).
Aggregates: Consistency boundaries grouping related entities.

Especially with Large Language Models (LLMs), making multiple requests one by one can feel like watching paint dry. This guide breaks down how to drastically speed things up using parallel processing with the PocketFlow Parallel Batch Example!
Imagine you need an LLM to translate something into eight languages. The usual way?
Ask for Chinese. Wait. 😴
Get Chinese back. Ask for Spanish. Wait. 😴
Get Spanish back. Ask for Japanese. Wait... 😴

You see the pattern? Each "wait" adds up. This is called sequential processing. It's simple, but when you're talking to slow things like LLMs over the internet, it's painfully slow.

The discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability in late 2021 exposed a critical weakness in rapid software deployment practices.

I often tell folks to “forget everything you know” about relational databases.
Designing data on DynamoDB requires a very different mindset.
The biggest shift is that you don’t start with your data structure, you start with your access patterns.
Understanding this concept will catapult you ahead of most folks building with DynamoDB.
It’s a mindshift from “what data do I have?” to “how will users access my data”.
Let’s break this concept in this article.

In SQL, you define your schema first and normalize data into tables:

The idea that you can whole swath replace an entire field or area of expertise is wrong on a number of levels. So here we go.
All the evidence we have is that current AI does not appreciate actual intelligence. See Gary Marcus's prescient take in 2022, Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall, for more on this. What has happened is that existing LLMs turn out to do really well with huge amounts of data and compute power.

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

One of the most underestimated aspects of API security is 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁. It’s not just about authentication-knowing 𝘄𝗵𝗼 is calling your API-but also about 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 they are allowed to do. Properly implemented permissions ensure that users and systems only access the resources and operations they are authorized for, reducing the risk of data leaks and malicious actions.
As backend engineers, we must go beyond the basics. Fine-grained permissions, role-based access control (RBAC), and the principle of least privilege are essential strategies. These not only protect sensitive data but also build trust with your users and clients.
Are you confident that your APIs are granting the right permissions to the right actors? How do you handle permission updates as your system evolves? Let’s share our experiences and best practices!

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

Paws is a Telegram-based Mini App created by the same team behind other projects, such as Notcoin and Dogs. 
If you’ve been cruising around Telegram lately, chances are you’ve stumbled upon Paws, the viral crypto Mini App that’s got everyone tapping, clicking and inviting their friends like it’s 2010 FarmVille all over again. 
Originally launched in October 2024 on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, Paws exploded in popularity with its ultra-simple tap-to-earn concept. Think of it as a gamified rewards engine embedded directly in Telegram, where users rack up points by completing tasks, referring others and interacting with mini-game elements.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again.

“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) John Durham has departed as President Donald Trump’s pick takes control of the office.
In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has abandoned plans to become a for-profit company and reaffirmed commitment to its nonprofit status. 
In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. 
“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement approach on crypto firms has left a lasting “regulatory overhang” within the industry, according to Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea. 
Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”
The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finz…]]></summary>
