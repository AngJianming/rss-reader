A senior engineer once told me about a six-month project his team completed for a major telecommunications provider. They delivered on time, within budget, and met every requirement in the specification. There was just one problem: it solved the wrong business problem. Despite all the technical excellence, they had built a sophisticated answer to a question nobody was asking. The entire system was scrapped three months later.
This scenario plays out repeatedly across our industry. We build technically impressive solutions that miss the mark because we don't truly understand the domain we're working in. As engineers, we're trained to solve problems—but are we solving the right problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working with the ESP32 is exciting—it’s a powerful microcontroller with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and dual-core processing all packed into a small form. But like many beginner-friendly tools, it’s also easy to misuse. Based on my hands-on experience building everything from smart watering systems to fall detection devices, here are the top 5 beginner mistakes I see often—and how you can avoid them.
Skipping the Datasheet (or Barely Reading It) 📄
The ESP32 has dozens of GPIOs, each with specific features and restrictions. Some pins are input-only, some are used during boot, and others like GPIO12 can lock your board in boot mode if pulled HIGH.
✅ Fix: Read the pinout and datasheet before connecting anything. Use safe GPIOs like 2, 4, 5, 18, 19, 21, 22, and 23 for most applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[La inteligencia artificial (IA) está transformando el mercado laboral a un ritmo acelerado, generando tanto incertidumbre como nuevas oportunidades. Muchos empleos tradicionales enfrentan el riesgo de desaparecer o cambiar drásticamente debido a la automatización y a la capacidad cada vez mayor de las máquinas para realizar tareas que antes eran exclusivas de los humanos.
Las profesiones más vulnerables suelen ser aquellas que implican tareas repetitivas, rutinarias o basadas en procesos estandarizados. Esto incluye sectores como la manufactura, la administración básica, y algunos roles en servicios al cliente o transporte. Por otro lado, los trabajos que requieren creatividad, habilidades interpersonales, pensamiento crítico y adaptabilidad son menos propensos a ser sustituidos por la IA.
Además, la tecnología está impulsando la creación de nuevas oportunidades laborales en áreas relacionadas con la programación, análisis de datos, inteligencia artificial aplicada, y supervisión de sistemas automatizados. Estas nuevas profesiones demandan formación continua y actualización constante, lo que destaca la importancia de la educación y el reciclaje profesional para mantenerse competitivo en el mercado laboral.
En resumen, aunque la IA representa un desafío para ciertos sectores laborales, también abre la puerta a nuevas especializaciones y formas de trabajo. Adaptarse a este nuevo panorama requerirá flexibilidad, aprendizaje permanente y la habilidad para colaborar con las tecnologías emergentes.

These days, I’m one of the co-founders at Kinde, where we’re building tools that power SaaS products—auth, billing, and feature flags, all in one place.
I still write code almost every day. But I also lead a remote team, ship product, and make decisions. Staying focused is hard.
Here’s the rhythm I’ve built to protect deep work:
6am gym: mental clarity + early momentum

Morning meetings only: clear the decks early

Midday reset: walk, food, some fresh air

Afternoon deep work: no interruptions, full flow

After-school time: playing with my kids 
Optional night session: only if I feel like it
We call it adult hours, a structure that respects your time and your brain.
More detail here if you’re curious:

👉 https://kinde.com/blog/startups/adult-hours
I’d love to hear how other devs (especially founders) carve out real focus time. What’s working for you?]]></summary>

As a result, pallet trucks have naturally become an essential tool in all logistics distribution centres. Autonomous pallet trucks are emerging as a more efficient alternative to address this challenge. This intelligent material handling technology leverages the power of automation to enhance the efficiency of pallet loading, unloading, and transportation processes.
This new technology can move autonomously within distribution centres or warehouses. Unlike traditional pallet trucks, it does not require human assistance. As a result, your employees can free up time to focus on more complex tasks.

In one of our recent cloud modernization efforts, we migrated a Kafka consumer written in Java and hosted on on-prem servers to a Python-based AWS Lambda integrated with Confluent Kafka. This move wasn’t just about changing languages or platforms—it was about simplifying our architecture, improving observability, and embedding quality deeply into the pipeline.
Let’s walk through how we rebuilt the system using AWS Lambda + Event Source Mapping (ESM), handled Avro schema parsing with caching, and set up a robust GitLab CI/CD testing strategy to ensure confidence in every deployment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project Overview
This is the start of a portfolio project: creating a full-featured landing page for Umemura Farm, a fictional asparagus farm and farmhouse inn based in Saga, Japan.
Today, I focused on Step 1: Defining the Purpose and Step 2: Researching similar cases ,critical groundwork before jumping into any design or code.
Step 1 – Project Purpose
To clarify the goals, I created a [Project Purpose Sheet] with the following key points:
Objective: Build a site that can act as both an online sales page (for award-winning asparagus) and an introduction to the farm stay experience.
Target audience: People seeking high-quality produce, thoughtful gifts, or rural lodging.
Success metrics: User engagement, conversions on product buttons, and brand recognition.
This step helped define what success should actually look like.
Step 2 – Competitive & UX Research
I looked at:
Competitor Best Practices
Farms that humanize the grower with storytelling and awards
Seasonal reservation systems with LINE/BASE integration
Testimonials that build emotional connection
UI/UX Patterns
Mobile-first layouts with hero video/image headers
Sticky headers with scroll-triggered logo swaps
Swiper.js carousels for customer voices or media
SEO Research
Keywords like “アスパラガス 通販”, “産直”, “佐賀 アスパラ”
Long-tail keywords like “アスパラ 美味しい農園”, “生産者直売”
Upcoming Steps



Step




Step 3: Define persona & messaging axis


Step 4: Wireframe & content structure


Step 5: Copywriting


Step 6: Design (desktop/mobile)


Step 7: Coding & animation


Step 8: Publish & track



Reflection
Even without a single line of code today, I feel much more focused.

Clear goals → focused UX decisions → stronger outcomes.
This project is fictional, but I’m approaching it as if it were a real client case, treating every step like production.
