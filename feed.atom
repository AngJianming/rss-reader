Steps to Enable Root Login in Ubuntu
Step 1: Allow Root Login via SSH.
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
PermitRootLogin yes
Step 2: Restart the SSH Service.
sudo systemctl restart ssh
Step 3: Set Root Password.
sudo passwd root
Step 4: Switch to Root User
su -
Important 
Conclusion
Ubuntu disables root login by default not because it lacks the capability, but as a deliberate security measure. Once you understand this philosophy, you can confidently enable root access when needed and use it wisely.]]></summary>

According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:
“Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”
Eich explained that Brave focuses on maximizing user choice while providing tools to engage with decentralized ecosystems. With this integration, users…]]></summary>

Technical bottlenecks often stem not from a lack of knowledge, but from misdefining the problem.
In 2019, I worked on a project that extracted clothing from 2D images and applied them to OpenGL-based 3D characters. Background removal was handled easily via thresholding, but generating meshes along the garment’s contour exploded the computation. Segmentation algorithms (like GrabCut) were overkill for the task. The essence of the problem was: “Keep only the essential points along the edge.” I found the answer in a GIS algorithm — Douglas-Peucker.
This algorithm simplifies complex polylines by retaining only the key points — reducing data without losing the essence. Exactly what I needed.
I later tested GPT with the same problem. It offered predictable answers. Why? Because I described the problem like a “pathfinding” issue.
This experience taught me: How you define the problem matters more than the answer itself.
"It wasn’t segmentation. It was contour simplification. I should have redefined the problem before choosing an algorithm."

It’s the control hub of your channel — managing how, when, and what content gets delivered to viewers. But beyond simply streaming video, modern playout systems do so much more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In Flutter, using a Radio button inside a ListTile can sometimes lead to confusion about interactivity. If you're aiming to make the Radio button non-clickable while allowing the entire ListTile to trigger a change, you may encounter color and usability issues. This article explores a solution to ensure that your Radio buttons maintain the desired inactive color while remaining unlinked from direct interaction.
Understanding the Problem
When you place a Radio button inside a ListTile, it becomes clickable by default. Adding an onChanged callback activates the radio button, allowing it to respond to interactions. However, if you do not provide an onChanged callback, the Radio button appears inactive and greyed out, making it look visually unappealing. The goal here is to ensure…]]></summary>

An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, each identified by an index or key. Arrays store multiple items of the same type together, allowing for efficient access to any element using its position number.
Fixed Size: In many languages, arrays have a predetermined size that cannot change after creation.
Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array typically have the same data type.
Contiguous Memory: Array elements are stored in adjacent memory locations, enabling efficient access.
Zero-Based Indexing: In most programming languages, array indices start at 0 (though some languages start at 1).
Random Access: Elements can be accessed directly using their index in O(1) time.

It's getting hard to follow the dev ecosystem — and even harder to find what’s worth reading.
So I built dailypush.dev, a search engine for real dev blog posts.
1300+ articles already indexed — and counting every day

Pulled from hundreds of developer blogs and sources
Each post is summarized using GPT


Tagged by topic (React, backend, AI, DevOps…)
You can search, filter, and like posts you find valuable
Popular content surfaces naturally based on views and upvotes







  
  
  ✨ Why I made it


I kept missing solid blog posts buried in newsletters, tweets, changelogs, and Medium SEO traps.

I wanted a single place to stay up to date and search blog posts like a developer — with summaries, clean metadata, and no fluff.
Ultimately, the goal is to make this curated by developers, for developers.
If there's traction, here’s what’s planned:
Personalized digests
Tag subscriptions
Saved posts & bookmarks
Recommendations by interest

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tether, issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDt, is rolling out its tokenized gold digital asset in Thailand with a listing on local cryptocurrency exchange Maxbit.
In a May 13 announcement, Tether said its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt), has been listed on Thai exchange Maxbit.
According to an X announcement by Maxbit, the platform is the first in Thailand to offer a “tokenized gold pair backed by physical gold.”
Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a gold-backed digital asset with a market cap of $802 million, with each XAUt representing ownership of one troy ounce of gold.
Thailand greenlighted stablecoins like Tether USDt in March
Tether Gold’s entrance in the Thai cryptocurrency market follows other notable stablecoin-related regulatory developments in the country.
In March, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission approved US dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across Thailand.

Launched in October 2023, Maxbit is a licensed digital asset exchange based in Thailand, operating under the oversight of the Thai SEC.
According to official SEC records, Thai energy conglomerate PTG Energy is the largest shareholder of Maxbit, with a 35% stake in the firm. Other Maxbit backers include two local private firms, Spearhead Labs and Unit Company, holding 29% and 28.7% in the digital asset business.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Dogecoin's 38% surge reflects strong market demand, with spot-buyer volumes taking charge since March. 

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.

Dogecoin's (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins).

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session.
