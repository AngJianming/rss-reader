        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. CSS ID vs Class



  
  
  What?




ID is a unique identifier for an HTML element.
Class is a reusable identifier that can be assigned to multiple elements.
Use ID when you want to style or manipulate one unique element on the page.
Use Class when you want to style or select multiple elements with the same styles.
IDs have higher specificity, so they override classes if both are applied to the same element.
Classes promote reusable styles and avoid duplication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[❓ What is Flexbox?


Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional layout system in CSS used to align and distribute space among items inside a container. It works in either a row or a column, but not both at the same time.
Use Flexbox when:
You want to align elements horizontally or vertically

You want to space items evenly

You need to build responsive layouts

You want easy alignment without using floats or position







  
  
  💡 Why is Flexbox Important?



It simplifies layout design

Handles resizing and spacing automatically

Replaces old hacks like float, inline-block, and positioning

Great for navbars, cards, buttons, galleries, footers, and more

The position property in CSS defines how an element is placed in the document layout. It controls whether an element follows the normal flow or is manually positioned using top, left, right, and bottom.

Use it when you want to:
Fix something on screen (like a navbar or button)

It took me over 2 hours and 3 failed attempts to solve [LeetCode 56: Merge Intervals].
Why?

Because sometimes the problem description and examples just aren’t enough to guide you — and that’s part of the challenge.
Some tricky cases like:

[[1,4],[2,3]]

[[1,4],[0,4]]

kept failing.

I assumed the intervals were always in sorted order — they weren’t.
Then I peeked at the solution and saw:

sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

That one line changed everything.
I paused, dug into how 2D sorting works in C++, and that helped unlock the logic.
✅ How sorting works for 2D vectors

🗣️ Reading discussions and others’ code can speed up learning

✍️ Writing it by hand helped reinforce the logic  
📸 Sharing my handwritten notes and final accepted solution in C++:





If you're just starting out too — remember: it's okay to take time. The goal is to learn.

It’s fast, it’s affordable, and it supports multiple languages with all the predictable cheer of a Disney ride operator.
But what happens when you want your voice app to sound... like you? Or your CEO? Or your 90-year-old grandfather? What if you need complete control over pronunciation, tone, pause patterns, and the ability to train on custom audio that would make Polly blush?

The display property defines how an HTML element should behave in the layout — as a block, inline, grid, flex, etc. It controls whether elements stack, sit side-by-side, take full width, or just wrap their content.

A maintainable and scalable solution requires a modern, well-structured approach — especially when dealing with multiple user roles and navigation scenarios. Without solid architecture, hardcoded components quickly become unmanageable as your application grows.
Instead of relying on hardcoded items, you can define a sidebar configuration as data and render items dynamically based on user roles. Here’s a clean and extensible approach using TypeScript:
type SidebarItem = {
  id: string
  title: string
  icon: keyof typeof Icons
  to: string
  allowedRoles: UserRole[]

While REST-based synchronous APIs are easy to start with, they don't scale well under high loads or when services are temporarily unavailable.

In this blog, we’ll build a bidirectional communication flow between two Spring Boot microservices using Spring Cloud Stream and Kafka.

I'm from Tamil Nadu and I recently completed my bachelor's in computer application .life hasn't been easy - I've faced deep emotional battles, family responsibilities and moments where everything felt too heavy to carry.
But even when i broke , I never stayed broken .I kept learning , kept dreaming & kept choosing growing .
Why I'm Here
I joined dev.to to document my journey - not just as a tech learner , but as a human being rebuilding from the ground up . I believe in sharing raw , honest learning , not just polished perfection.
You’ll see posts from me like:
What I learned in my classes today
Simple Java logic I tried and failed at (and then succeeded!)
How coding is helping me heal and move forward
My Dream
One day, I want to build something meaningful — something that helps people feel seen and supported, especially those who feel left out. Tech is not just my career goal; it's my way of creating a life with purpose.
** To Anyone Reading This: **
If you’re also starting, or restarting, or just tired — I want to say this:

You don’t need to be perfect to begin.

You just need to begin. 
Thanks for reading my first post. I’ll be back tomorrow — not to impress, but to express.
