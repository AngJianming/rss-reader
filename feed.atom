During that time, I’ve reviewed dozens of take-home projects, attended numerous whiteboard sessions, and observed the evolution of interview trends.
But lately, something’s changed.
Candidates are using AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to pass technical interviews, often in ways that bypass actual engineering judgment. I’m not against AI—it's a powerful tool when used responsibly. But when it's used to mask a candidate’s true skill level, it undermines the purpose of technical hiring.

Support tickets…
Nobody really loves either writing or much worse reading them. And managing them is much much worse than managing my laundry, and that is a really high bar to pass.
So, in a world where we all are writing and summarising emails for the sake of maintaining formality, automating support tickets seems like the logical next step.
And sure there are companies that do this… not really going to name them, but my vision here was to just create something that takes the unorganized text and convert it to organized boxes, while still being pretty to look at… cough Jira cough.

Traditional RAG systems have a glaring issue: they search for everything. User asks about pizza recipes? Search the knowledge base. Wants to know the weather? Search again. Having a casual conversation? Yep, another search.

Irrelevant context cluttering the LLM's input
Higher costs from unnecessary searches and longer prompts
Slower responses due to constant database hits
Confused AI trying to make sense of unrelated documents
What if the AI could decide for itself when it actually needs to search?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there’s one thing I’ve learned as a programmer, it’s that failure isn’t just inevitable—it’s essential. In coding, mistakes, bugs, and errors aren’t signs of defeat but stepping stones to growth. Here’s why every programmer should embrace failure and see it as a powerful tool for improvement.
First, failure teaches you resilience. When your code doesn’t work, it’s easy to feel frustrated or discouraged. But pushing through those tough moments builds mental toughness and persistence, which are crucial skills not only in programming but in life.
Second, failure is a fantastic learning opportunity. Each bug or error challenges you to dig deeper and understand how things really work. You develop problem-solving skills by figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it, which sharpens your coding abilities.
Third, failure encourages experimentation and creativity. When you’re not afraid to make mistakes, you’re more likely to try new approaches, test out wild ideas, and innovate. Some of the best features and solutions come from taking risks and learning from what didn’t work.
Fourth, failure fosters humility and collaboration. It reminds us that we don’t know everything, which opens the door to asking for help, learning from others, and working better as a team.
Lastly, embracing failure helps you build confidence. Over time, you realize that mistakes don’t define you—they’re just part of the process. That mindset shift makes tackling bigger challenges less intimidating.
So if you’re struggling with bugs or feeling stuck, remember: failure is your friend. It’s proof that you’re pushing boundaries and growing as a coder. Embrace it, learn from it, and keep coding. What’s a failure that taught you something important? Share your story!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wondered how an app turns a scanned image into editable text? That’s the magic of OCR — Optical Character Recognition — and tools like Tesseract power much of this behind the scenes.
In this post, we’ll break down how OCR engines like Tesseract work, from reading pixels to returning readable characters.
📌 What is OCR?
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is the process of converting images of printed or handwritten text into machine-readable digital text.
It’s widely used in:

• Building screen-scraping and automation tools
🧠 How OCR Works – Step-by-Step
Here’s a simplified pipeline of how OCR engines operate:
1️⃣ Image Preprocessing
Before OCR can recognize text, the image needs to be “cleaned up”:
2️⃣ Text Detection and Segmentation
Once the image is clean:
3️⃣ Character Recognition
This is where the core OCR happens:
4️⃣ Post-Processing
To improve accuracy:
🔧 How Tesseract Works (Under the Hood)
Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google.
Key features:
Here’s a basic example using Python:
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

text = pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open("sample.png"))
print(text)

This simple script can extract readable text from almost any image.
⚠️ Common OCR Challenges
Even modern engines struggle with:
That’s why OCR accuracy often depends heavily on preprocessing.
🛠 Real-World Use Case
In a previous project, I worked on automating the extraction of text from scanned IP (Intellectual Property) legal documents. Many of these had:
By combining OpenCV preprocessing + Tesseract OCR, we achieved over 90% accuracy in text extraction — saving hours of manual review.
✅ Conclusion
OCR isn’t magic — it’s a combination of image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning.
Tesseract makes it possible to implement OCR in just a few lines of code, but understanding how it works helps you fine-tune results and apply it to real-world projects.
