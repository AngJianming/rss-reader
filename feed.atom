        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's fast-paced digital world, teams need more than just human talent to stay competitive. They also need intelligent tools that boost productivity, speed up workflows, and provide real-time analytics. That's where artificial intelligence (AI) shines. By combining AI with team augmentation, companies can increase productivity and innovation like never before.
Team augmentation means adding skilled individuals to an existing team, often on a temporary or project-based basis. This helps fill talent gaps, scale resources quickly, and increase agility. Traditionally, these individuals have been human experts hired from outside the organization. But now, with the rise of AI, teams are also augmented by intelligent technologies.
AI doesn't replace humans - it enhances them. It acts as an intelligent assistant that supports teams in a variety of ways. From performing repetitive tasks to offering data-driven recommendations, AI helps people focus on what really matters: creativity, problem solving, and decision making.
1. Automating Routine Work
2. Improved Decision Making
3. Improved Collaboration
4. Support for Learning and Skill Development
Integrating AI into team augmentation offers many benefits:
Increased efficiency - tasks are completed faster and with fewer errors.
Cost reduction - automation reduces the need for manual labor.
Scalability - companies can quickly scale operations without overloading staff.
Rapid onboarding - AI can help new team members learn faster by offering guided tools and frequently asked questions.
Smarter workflows - teams receive real-time recommendations on how to work better.
Taken together, these benefits create a more agile and resilient organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language that has evolved to deliver near-native performance, thanks to sophisticated engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore, and Chakra. This article explores the internal workings of these engines and how they achieve efficient execution.
A JavaScript engine is a program that executes JavaScript code. Most engines today are built with similar core components:
Parser: Transforms source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
Interpreter: Executes the code line-by-line initially
JIT Compiler: Compiles hot code paths into optimized machine code
Garbage Collector: Reclaims memory no longer in use

Fix paddle-ball collision bug
Refactor game loop code
Labels categorize issues (e.g., bug, enhancement, good first issue, help wanted).
Milestones group related issues under a single release or feature (e.g., v1.0 Release).
Assign tasks to team members (or yourself) so everyone knows who’s working on what.

But here's the funny thing: strip away the shiny surfaces, and you'll find we're not so different from our grandparents. Or their grandparents. Or honestly, even those philosophers who wandered around ancient Greece in togas.
Your "New" Outfit? Grandma Wore It First
Fashion keeps playing this endless game of dress-up:
That "fresh" bob haircut? Flappers did it in the 1920s
Platform shoes? My aunt still has hers from the 70s
Tiny sunglasses? Jackie O was rocking them before my parents were born
That Hot New Song? It Samples Your Childhood
Music today is like a cultural recycling bin:
TikTok hits often use samples from 90s songs
"New" rap flows borrow from 80s hip-hop
Even those futuristic synth sounds? Basically just 80s keyboards with better technology
Your Fancy Gadgets? Just Fancier Versions of Old Things
The camera replaces my old Kodak
Texting is just passing notes in class but digital
Google Maps? We used to yell at our dads to pull over and check the paper map
And don't get me started on "new" social media:
Instagram Stories? Basically the modern photo album
Twitter threads? Just letters to the editor but instant
Even VR chatrooms are just fancy versions of AOL chat rooms from my childhood
We're Still Fighting the Same Battles
Workplace equality debates? My grandmother had the same arguments in the 60s
Racial justice movements? Building on civil rights work from generations ago
Even our climate anxiety - scientists were warning about environmental damage in the 1970s
The More Things Change...

Maybe that's comforting. Our great-grandparents navigated their own version of rapid change and uncertainty. They had their own "modern" problems that probably felt just as overwhelming as ours do today.
So the next time someone tries to sell you on the "next big thing," take a closer look. You might just be looking at yesterday's news wearing a new outfit.]]></summary>

For system administrators, surprises are rarely a good thing. Whether it's a sudden spike in CPU usage, memory running dangerously low, or disk space nearing its limit, these issues can quickly escalate into major problems : from system slowdowns to full outages.
1. Why monitor your server every minute?


When it comes to server health, timing is everything. Even a few minutes of downtime can have serious consequences… from lost revenue to broken user trust. While traditional monitoring solutions may check system status every 5 or 10 minutes, some environments require faster feedback and immediate awareness.

Created by Walter Bright, it is meant to be a viable alternative to C++ for developers seeking to improve productivity and code safety while maintaining the low-level control that C++ offers.
DLang is a general-purpose, statically typed programming language with many parallels to C++. Like C++, it supports object-oriented programming, manual memory management and systems programming. However, DLang builds on these fundamentals by introducing features that mitigate some of the complexities and pitfalls of C++, like garbage collection.

“For some reason, founders and CEOs think that they should be raising capital at 50 to 80 times revenue. So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14.
“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.”

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin's all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. 
From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.
Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.

Bitcoin’s realized cap has grown by $30 billion since April 20, reflecting steady investor confidence and new capital inflows.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post, Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe's crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider:
“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”

Summer Mersinger, one of four commissioners currently serving at the US financial regulatory body Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will become the next CEO of the digital asset advocacy group the Blockchain Association (BA). 
In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would step down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2.
