With the evolution of storage technologies, particularly the shift from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) to solid-state drives (SSDs), the methods and effectiveness of file deletion have changed significantly. Let's explore the intricacies of file deletion, the differences between SSD forensics and old-school disk wiping, and debunk some common myths.
When you delete a file from your computer, it's not immediately erased from the storage device. Instead, the operating system removes the file's entry from the file system, marking the space it occupied as available for new data. This means that the file's data remains on the storage device until it is overwritten by new files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How We Fixed Our Shipping Integration Chaos with Ditto: A Fulfillment Use Case in E-Commerce


The modern e-commerce supply chain moves fast‚Äîbut integrating with third-party shipping services doesn‚Äôt. We learned this the hard way, juggling broken APIs, unreliable sandbox environments, and zero visibility into request/response flows.
üì¶ The Problem: Shipping APIs Were Slowing Us Down


We‚Äôre an e-commerce platform managing thousands of orders per day. Shipping is critical to our customer experience. But integrating with new carriers or updating old integrations was painful:
No reliable sandboxes: Most shipping providers had inconsistent or outdated test environments.
Delayed feedback: Every change needed a full deploy, then a real API hit, and then debugging based on logs.
Hard to test edge cases: Simulating scenarios like "address not found", "label unavailable", or "customs hold" was impossible.
Cross-team bottlenecks: Backend, QA, and devOps were constantly waiting on each other just to test a single flow.
Every integration took weeks longer than it should have, with late nights spent tailing logs and replaying requests.
üöÄ Enter Ditto: Mock APIs That Work Like the Real Thing


We deployed Ditto internally as a drop-in mock server platform. Think of it like Postman‚Äîbut private, flexible, and built for teams.
1. Created realistic mocks for all shipping APIs
2. Collaborative interface
3. Integrated with CI/CD
4. Zero downtime testing
üè≠ Use Case: Fulfillment ‚Üí Shipping in E-Commerce


Here‚Äôs a specific example:
Scenario:
Pain Point:
With Ditto:
üí∞ ROI: Faster Delivery Times, Happier Devs, and Lower Costs


After adopting Ditto, our team saw immediate benefits:

We estimate that Ditto saved over 200 hours of dev time in the first quarter alone. More importantly, it helped us ship (pun intended) with confidence.
APIs should never be a bottleneck. With Ditto, they‚Äôre not.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin‚Äôs price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin‚Äôs price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801.

So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific‚Äôs shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

Short-term Bitcoin holders realized $11.6 billion in profit over the past 30 days, suggesting a potential pause or local top in the market.

Technical indicators show cooling momentum as retail investor sentiment falls to a 90-day low and liquidity data points to price volatility.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market "breather."
Glassnode analysis shows that STHs, often considered traders rather than long-term investors, have realized a staggering $11.6 billion in profits over the last 30 days. This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,0‚Ä¶]]></summary>

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical.

Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin met yesterday at the president‚Äôs golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.
Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an ‚Äúultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,‚Äù which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president.¬†
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence.¬†
Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump‚Äôs presidential duties.‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn‚Äôt breached the protocol‚Äôs smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.

Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn‚Äôt need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?
