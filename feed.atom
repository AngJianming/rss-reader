I've been watching indie hackers and startup founders frantically cobbling together tech stacks with Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for queues, Elasticsearch for search, and MongoDB for... reasons?
I'm guilty of this too. When I started building UserJot (my feedback and roadmap tool), my first instinct was to plan out a "proper" architecture with separate services for everything. Then I stopped and asked myself: what if I just used Postgres for everything?
Turns out, there's this elephant in the room that nobody wants to acknowledge:
Postgres can do literally all of this.
And it does it better than you think.
Let me guess - you've been told that Postgres is "just a relational database" and you need specialized tools for spec…]]></summary>

think you need to know more. I would suggest instead to focus deeply on the fundamentals of what you are currently learning and practice and apply the knowledge to projects. You will never know everything anyway and you won't be good enough either just with JavaScript. So be courageous and move on to the next step in your learning roadmap.


Studying without practice


Rushing through concepts


Not taking breaks


Not working on projects enough

  Introduction


Immutability has emerged as a dominant paradigm in modern software engineering, particularly in functional programming and state management. In JavaScript, where mutation can lead to unpredictable states and difficult-to-maintain code, the advantages of immutability extend far beyond the realm of cleaner syntax. This article examines immutability's historical context, technical underpinnings, and its impact on performance, drawing upon real-world applications and advanced implementation techniques.
Immutability has its roots in functional programming languages such as Haskell and Lisp. The traditional object-oriented programming approach often results in mutable state, leading to side effects that co…]]></summary>

This is my first-ever submission to DEV, and I was excited to participate! I've been trying to dabble more in responsive frontend development and through this project, I gained so much insight into designing visually appealing landing pages, enhanced my skills in JavaScript, and deepened my appreciation for the historical achievements and key figures within the LGBTQ+ community.
I'm particularly proud of how the slideshow effectively combines educational content with a clean and intuitive user interface. I'd love to expand this project in the future by incorporating additional interactive elements, such as timeline animations and deeper informational resources.
Happy Pride Month! 🏳️‍🌈]]></summary>

Introducción


Un componente central en muchas infraestructuras empresariales tradicionales ha sido el mainframe, una plataforma que durante décadas ha funcionado como la columna vertebral de aplicaciones críticas, especialmente en sectores como la banca, los seguros, el retail, el gobierno, entre otros.
Los sistemas de Mainframe se destacan por su fiabilidad, alto rendimiento y capacidad para procesar grandes volúmenes de transacciones. No obstante, hoy representan un reto significativo porque son costosos de mantener, difíciles de integrar con tecnologías modernas, y existe una creciente escasez de profesionales capacitados en lenguajes como COBOL, PL/I o ensamblador.

For context , I have learnt C language for more than 10 months , and it has been good 10 months since , now in addition to C , I've planned to learn Java . 
Java definitely has a complex syntax in comparison to C , but is meaningful so far . Few things that I understood are :
Apart from these basic things , I finally completed my "hello world" ritual in Java !! Syntax to take user input got me off for a while , but I managed to understand the reason for it to be complex , which makes more sense once a beginner like me goes into depth of ever Keyword popping on IDE . Trust me , C seems very easy to grasp , but Java adds more meaning to programming . Overall it was good day , will keep updating my Journey !]]></summary>

Today marks a small but meaningful milestone—I finally completed my 6th semester! 🎉
The last paper was Big Data, and honestly, it went well. Felt good to wrap things up on a high note.
But that’s not all—this blog marks the 14th consecutive blog.

Two whole weeks of consistency. I’ve never stuck to something like this before, and it genuinely feels great. It’s not about how perfect the posts are—it’s the habit. The discipline. The little 10-15 minutes I’ve been giving to show up every single day. That’s what I’m proud of.
After the exam, I went out for a family dinner, so my energy levels were zero by the time I got home. No work done today, and that’s okay. We all need breaks—especially after weeks of grinding through notes, deadlines, and projects.
Starting tomorrow, I’ll be switching gears:
But for tonight, I’ll let myself breathe.
Exams ✅
Here’s to consistency!

In many enterprise environments - especially SMBs using digital portals, customers ask for a streamlined login experience:
User clicks “Log In” in your App.
They are immediately redirected to their company’s IdP (e.g. Azure AD, Okta).
They do not want to see an Auth0-branded login page.
After authentication, they return to your application seamlessly.
In this flow, Auth0 acts purely as a broker between your application and the enterprise IdP. It handles OAuth 2.0/OIDC mechanics security, PKCE, state, tokens-while allowing you to maintain full control over the user experience and comply with enterprise firewall requirements.

Crossplane is an opensource project primarily developed and maintained by Upbound, a company focused on building tools for cloud-native infrastructure and application management. The project also has contributions from various individual developers and organizations within the cloud-native and Kubernetes community. 
Essentially, it is a Kubernetes-native control plane that enables declarative infrastructure and application management via Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Its power comes from the provider system, which enables Crossplane to interface with external APIs (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). 
This document describes how Crossplane and a Crossplane provider (e.g., provider-aws) are interconnected, their dependencies, and how data flows between components.
