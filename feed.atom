Yes, you read that right, SPL (Structured Process Language) is a programming language that codes in a grid, and specially used for processing structured data.
We know that almost all programming languages write code as text, so what does SPL code look like, and what is the difference between the grid-style code and the text-style code? Let's take a look at the programming environment of SPL first.

What are the benefits of writing code in a grid?
When programming, we always need to use intermediate variables and name them. However, when we program in SPL, naming variables is often unnecessary. SPL allows us to reference the name of previous cell directly in subsequent steps and get the calculation result of the cell (such as A1), for example, …]]></summary>

We all know the feeling, right? Deep in the trenches of code, fifth cup of coffee kicking in, the screen a hypnotic kaleidoscope of brackets and semicolons. We love solving problems with code. So much so, that we sometimes forget... well, everything else. Especially writing.

For a long time, writing felt like that annoying linter warning you just want to ignore with // eslint-disable-next-line. "Why should I write down what I'm doing? The code is the ultimate truth! Comments are for newbies, and nobody reads docs anyway!" Sound familiar? I was fully bought into the "code-is-self-documenting" cult. Spoiler alert: It wasn't. And that cost me time. A lot of time.

In this post I’ll take you from a native solution to an elegant O(n) approach you can drop straight into production.

1. When You Actually Need to Optimize
Picture this:
Latency suddenly spikes in one of your critical APIs. You dive into the logs and find the issue: a tiny helper function that’s supposed to “find two numbers that add up to X.”
The code looks clean. Easy to understand. The problem? It’s using two nested loops — O(n²) time.
When the dataset was small, nobody noticed. Now, under real traffic, that tiny function is wrecking your performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any real-world project has at least two environments — dev and prod — and often more: qa, staging, sometimes even region-specific environments.
Why? Because you want to catch mistakes before they reach production and impact your users.
From an infrastructure perspective, environments often differ significantly: different data, sizes, pricing tiers… even access controls. It’s not just about testing functionality — it’s about protecting production, reducing costs, and keeping things clean.
In Pulumi, environments are managed through stacks. A stack is an isolated instance of your Pulumi program, with its own configuration, state, and resources.
When you initialized your project, you may have already created a stack — but you can add more at any time. For example:

Forms are fundamental in web applications as they enable users to input data. Whether you're collecting user information, comments, or other types of data, forms serve as the primary interface for user interactions. In Ruby on Rails, handling forms is made simple with built-in helpers that streamline the process and ensure your application remains secure.

When I first started learning Go (Golang), everything felt a little strange. Coming from the Python and JavaScript background😅😅., I expected to deal with new syntax, but I didn’t expect to get stuck on the very first line of every Go file:
package main
I remember asking myself:
"Why do we declare the package name before the start of any code?"
📦 What Is a Package in Go?
In Go, as well as other languages like Python, a package is a way to organize and reuse code. Every .go file must start by declaring which package it belongs to.
There are two kinds of packages you’ll encounter early on:

The #[repr(transparent)] attribute in Rust is used to indicate that a struct represents a single variant of a type that can be safely treated as equivalent to its single field. This is particularly useful for effectively working with opaque types or for implementing newtype patterns.

In a May 5 letter to the Office of Government Ethics, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley said that Trump and his family stand to personally profit from an investment involving UAE state-backed firm MGX, crypto exchange Binance and World Liberty Financial (WLFI).
The senators called for an urgent probe, warning the deal may violate the US Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and federal bribery statutes.
At the center of the controversy is WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, reportedly chosen for a $2 billion investment MGX plans to make into Binance.

“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Tron public relations team confirmed that on May 2, the Tron DAO account posted a contract address and sent direct messages to solicit payments in exchange for promotional advertising on the Tron account.
“Our security team quickly identified the intrusion and cut off access to the hacker, but we ask the community to continue to be vigilant. We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. 
The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000.

On May 5, Tether minted another $1 billion Tether (USDT) on the Tron network, according to Arkham Intelligence. This brings the total USDT on Tron to $71.4 billion, according to the Tether Transparency report. 
In comparison, there is currently $72.8 billion USDT circulating on the Ethereum network, so just $1.4 billion more USDT on Tron will see it become the leading network for the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, as it has been previously over the last two years.

In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy.

PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”

Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

The BNB token has a market capitalization of roughly $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. As of May 5, BNB stakers earn a yield of approximately 2.5%, according to data from Stakingrewards.com.

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said, “teachers are going the extra mile for their students’ education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms.” The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
