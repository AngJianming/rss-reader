        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …]]></summary>

If you thought streaming was just about slinging text deltas, V5 is here to expand your horizons quite a bit.
This time, we're getting into the nitty-gritty of the V5 UI Message Streaming Protocol. This isn't just a minor update; it's a fundamental rewrite designed to handle the complexity of modern AI interactions – think tool calls, file attachments, structured metadata, and those crucial reasoning steps, all streaming in real-time.
As a quick heads-up, we're still sailing in V5 canary waters. This means APIs can shift, and things might look a tad different by the time it hits stab…]]></summary>

Terraform is a IAC (infrastructure as code) tool, so you write config (similar to Dockerfile for example), and define what services you need, so it creates that service on your account.
Using them together is a superpower, Terraform works with major providers like Azure, AWS & GCP so anything works.
So let's start with understanding some basic services, later I'll show how to use them in detail, but fundamentals are important.
There's hundreds of services, but I'll go through only the main ones, after that the rest is similar and easy to get used to when needed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with SQL, one of the common inquiries developers face is whether the CASE statement in their SELECT clause effectively filters records or if they also need to replicate the same conditions in the WHERE clause. This question is particularly pertinent when grouping certain entries, such as teams, and seeking clarity on how SQL evaluates these expressions.
Understanding SQL CASE and WHERE Clauses
The CASE statement is primarily used to create conditional logic inside your SQL queries, particularly in the SELECT clause. Its purpose is to return specific values based on the conditions you define. However, the WHERE clause serves a different function; it limits the rows returned by the query based on certain conditions.
Why You Might Need Both CASE and WHERE

Over the past few years, Linux has become a prime target for ransomware gangs, especially as more businesses move to cloud, virtualization, and container-based infrastructure.
Threats like Helldown, AvosLocker, Hive, and REvil have all released Linux variants, and attackers are getting bolder and more sophisticated every year.

The acquisition of CryptoPunks, plus its additional $25 million endowment, establishes NODE as “the most well-capitalized nonprofit dedicated solely to digital art in the United States,” the foundation said in an X post. 
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
The nonprofit said it has assembled an advisory board to oversee the CryptoPunks collection. It comprises Matt Hall and John Watkinson — the artists behind the NFT collection — and a representative of Yuga Labs, among others.

In a May 13 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Eric Council Jr.’s legal team asked that he be sentenced to no more than one year and one day in prison following his guilty plea. 
Council was part of a group that took control of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) X account in 2024 through a SIM swap attack, posting a message that suggested the regulator had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund listings for the first time.

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …]]></summary>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

On May 9, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

The outflow occurred as Bitcoin traded above $103,600 and just days after the White House announced a 90-day reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the US and China, easing market concerns and lifting broader investor sentiment.

Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“

The committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul on May 13, the local news agency News1 reported.
During its first meeting, the committee highlighted the importance of resolving regulatory uncertainty and addressing burning issues like stablecoin regulation amid the push for US-dollar stablecoins by the US government.
The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC).

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said.

Jenner had escaped a class-action lawsuit from buyers of her self-titled memecoin, Caitlyn Jenner (JENNER) after California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. said in a motion filed on May 9 that it was “sufficient to conclude that all nine causes of action are deficient” and sided with Jenner in dismissing the suit in its entirety for failure to state a claim.
He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original.

In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

The recent filing was part of the prosecutor’s request to sentence him to two years in prison over his role in the hack, which saw the SEC X account publish a false announcement that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was approved, shaking up the markets. 
Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.

Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.
