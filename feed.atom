I will give a super brief explanation of them which can serve as a quick-remembering-guide for example. Besides that, I mention some connected topics to keep in mind without going into more detail and I have a quick code snippet as well.
The simplest and oldest type - but it's insecure. So do not use it, just know about it.
It's been in HTTP since version 1 and simply includes the credentials in the request:
Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>

As you see, we set the HTTP header Authorization to the string username:password, encode it with base64 and prefix Basic. The server then decodes the value, that is, remove Basic and decode base64, and then checks if the credentials are c…]]></summary>

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

I built Kitty to solve a problem I faced while managing configuration files across servers: I wanted Git-like tracking for system config files, but with built-in encryption and the ability to keep files in their original locations.
What is Kitty?
Secure configuration management tool with Git-like commands
Files remain in their original locations (no need to symlink like with dotfiles managers)
All stored content is encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305
Password-protected repository access
Choose between file-based or SQLite storage
Works with system files that might require elevated privileges
Core features:
Track, version, and restore configuration files
See differences between tracked and current versions
Filter and group tracked files
Restore previous versions when needed
Privilege handling for system files
Kitty is designed for sysadmins, DevOps engineers, and anyone who wants to securely track configuration files without moving them into a Git repository.
The project is open source and written in Rust. It focuses on security first, with all sensitive content encrypted, making it suitable for tracking credentials and other sensitive configurations.
GitHub repo: https://github.com/kometen/kitty
I'd love feedback from the HN community, especially on the security model and additional features that would be useful for your configuration management workflow.]]></summary>

Opening and closing tags:
<?php ?>

Note: omitting the closing tag at the end of a file can be beneficial so you don't have any unwanted white space at the end of the file
Printing:
echo 'This prints to the screen.';
<?= 'This works too.'; ?>

Commenting:
One line:
# This is a one-line comment in PHP

Multi-line:
/* This is a multi-
line comment in PHP */

Checking variable type:
var_dump($var_name);

Comparing Floats:
Note: Comparing floats in PHP is tricky because of precision. The following is a workaround for that limitation.
<?php
$a = 1.23456789;
$b = 1.23456780;
$epsilon = 0.00001;

if (abs($a - $b) < $epsilon) {
    echo "true";
}
?>

String Definitions:
'this is a string'

"this is a string"

<<<END
   this
        is also
               a string
END

<<<'EOD'
This is an example of
another type of string
you can use in PHP.
EOD


String Interpolation:
<?php
$juice = "apple";

echo "He drank some $juice juice." . PHP_EOL;

?>

or
echo 'this line prints a {$var}';

String concatenation uses a . rather than a + in PHP.
I used PHP's documentation as the source of my information here. Some of the code will be similar or identical.]]></summary>

In this post, we’ll take a smarter approach and cover:
Setting up Serilog for structured logging in .NET
Logging exceptions using source generators

Outputting request payloads as structured JSON
Masking sensitive data to stay compliant (GDPR, etc.)
Enriching logs with contextual information like OrderId

Cyber criminals have made scamming a trillion-dollar business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When working with SQL, developers often seek efficient ways to perform complex calculations. A fascinating approach is implementing CLR custom aggregations using Reverse-Polish notation. In this article, we'll explore how to apply this concept to calculate arbitrary calculations in SQL, focusing on why issues may arise and how to resolve them effectively.
Understanding Reverse-Polish Notation
Reverse-Polish notation (RPN) offers a way to express calculations without the need for parentheses. For example, a standard expression like (100 * 1) + (10 * 2) can be written in RPN as 100 1 * 10 2 * +. By developing CLR functions such as ReversePolishAggregate and ToReversePolishArguments, we can compute results directly within SQL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has reportedly fired a group of customer support agents following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. The contracted agents were based in India. 
According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.
Qiao Wang, a core contributor to Alliance DAO, said in a May 15 X post that he may have been a victim of one of these attacks. He said a scammer notified him his Coinbase account had been compromised, asked him to verify his personal information, to which the criminals likely had access through the compromised agents, and requested he withdraw all his funds to a “Coinbase self-custodial wallet.”
“I called them out at the end of the call telling them they need to step up their game [...],” said Wang on X. “They told me that had made $7m that day.”
Cointelegraph reached out to Martin and Coinbase for comments, but had not received responses at the time of publication.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…]]></summary>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…]]></summary>

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Stablecoin issuer Tether minted another 1 billion USDt tokens on Tron, pushing the network’s authorized USDT supply to surpass Ethereum’s.
On May 15, blockchain data showed that Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), into the Tron network. 
As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s. 
In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion.

“I’m seeing a lot of brands rethinking where revenue and fan engagement come from,” Kahn said during an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph. “A lot of franchises, like the ones we work with — NBA, NFL, Disney — have already had years of success with digital collection, and we’re seeing a lot of brands express interest in digital collectibles as a way to engage with fan bases at a time when physical costs are riskier and unknown.”

On this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls “Bitcoin Season 2.”

Bitcoin beyond money
“Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,” said Duke. 
“What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”
New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value.

Bitcoin’s price is retracing, but strong ETF inflows, high network activity and whale accumulation suggest BTC is on track to $140,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.9 billion in net inflows in two weeks, mirroring past rallies.

Declining exchange balances and a rising transaction volume Z-score suggest increasing overall demand.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was down 1.4% over the last 24 hours. It traded 6% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached on Jan. 20. Nevertheless, several fundamental, onchain and technical metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upside is not over.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he’s “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch.
Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.
Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of reta…]]></summary>

Digital assets like stablecoins are the “perfect” financial instrument for real-time collateral management, according to a recent pilot by DTCC Digital Assets, which suggests that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, could modernize and simplify this critical function.

According to a May 15 blog post, Coinbase said a group of external actors bribed and coordinated with several customer support contractors to access internal systems and steal limited user account data.
“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” Coinbase said, adding that no passwords, private keys, funds or Coinbase Prime accounts were affected.
Less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users’ data was affected by the attack, the company said.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in a month after forming a local low at $1.80. Improving risk appetite and prospects of an “altseason” have boosted its price.

The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants, Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.
