        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Spoiler: Together, They’re Unstoppable!)
Imagine building a Robot army 🤖⚔️ (ADK) that can also hack into every database on Earth 🔓 (MCP). That’s the power combo we’re unpacking today! 
Forget "vs." — let’s merge Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create AI systems that -
Think
Act
Adapt
.......like never before. Buckle up!
(Build armies of AI agents that work like a hive mind!)
💡 What Makes ADK a Game-Changer?
Python-Powered Simplicity: Code agents in minutes, not months. 
Dynamic Teams: Agents delegate tasks like a CEO (e.g., "Hey FinanceBot, handle the invoice while I chat with the customer!"). 
Multimodal Magic: Voice, video, text—Netflix-style interactions for AI 🎥🔊. 
🛠️ ADK’s Weakness: It’s data-hungry but lacks direct access to your private files, calendars, or APIs. That’s where MCP swoops in! 

(Your LLM’s backstage pass to the real world!)
💡 Why MCP is the Silent Hero
Universal Plug-and-Play: Like USB-C for AI—connect Claude to Google Drive, GitHub, or even your smart fridge 🧃.
Privacy-First: Data access only after user consent (no creepy overreach!).
Real-Time Context: Agents see your world, not just the open web.
⚡ Killer Feature: Prompts as Superpowers
Define triggers like /check-calendar to let AI act before you ask.
🛠️ MCP’s Weakness: It’s a connector, not a builder. You need ADK (or similar) to create agents that use those connections. 

Example: Build a Personal Assistant That’s Smarter Than J.A.R.V.I.S

Step 1: Use MCP to link: 
Your Google Calendar 📅 
Work emails 📧 
Fitness tracker 🏋️♂️
Result: Your assistant auto-reschedules meetings if your Fitbit detects stress—without coding APIs from scratch 🤯.

ADK = Conductor 🎻 
MCP = Orchestra’s instruments 🎺 
You = The Composer 🎼 
ADK and MCP aren’t rivals—they’re peanut butter and jelly 🥜🍇.

If you use a computer — whether it’s for programming, writing, or just everyday tasks — chances are you rely on your keyboard more than you think. From crafting blog posts and coding projects to drafting books or simply replying to emails, typing is a core part of your digital life.
Most people type at an average speed of 10 to 50 words per minute (WPM), which gets the job done, but it leaves a lot of room for improvement. The good news? With just a little focused daily training, you can dramatically boost your typing speed and accuracy, unlocking a faster, smoother workflow.
Like any speed measurement unit, KPH or MPH for example, it's basically how many words you can type in a minute. According to a survey done in March 2025 by onlinetyping.org on 56,000 volunteers, 28…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tarting November 1, 2025, Google Play will require all new apps and app updates targeting Android 15+ to be compatible with 16KB memory pages. Here's what that means for you and how to get your app ready.
📦 Why This Matters
📈 Real-world benefits seen on devices with 16KB pages:
App launch time: up to 30% faster
Battery life: ~4.5% improvement
Camera startup: 4.5–6.6% faster
System boot: ~8% faster
✅ Is Your App Affected?
You don’t use native code or native libraries
You need to check compatibility if:
You’re building native extensions or relying on native SDKs
🛠️ How to Make Your App 16KB-Compatible
Audit Your Dependencies
Test in 16KB Environments
Use APK Analyzer
🔍 How to Test
Use the APK Analyzer to flag potential issues
Check the .so files and linked symbols for assumptions about 4KB pages
⏳ What If You Don't Update?
🧪 Bonus: Use This Gradle Snippet to Warn Early
groovy
android {
    lintOptions {
        checkReleaseBuilds true
        warningsAsErrors true
    }
}

Combine that with static analysis or custom lint rules to catch compatibility issues early in CI.

That’s why we built MCPX - an open-source gateway that helps you add visibility, guardrails, and permissioning around MCP usage. Whether you're testing locally or building toward more complex workflows, MCPX gives you control over how agents interact with your tool ecosystem.
Check it out:
MCPX on GitHub
We’re seeing real traction in teams using MCP to let agents call tools like Slack, GitHub, Gmail, internal APIs, and more. But the operational gaps are clear:
Agents can call tools they shouldn’t
No way to group or gate sensitive actions
No built-in audit or usage tracking

Join me on this journey!
“I want to grow, but I don’t know what my next step is.”

So many developers stay stuck in neutral, waiting:
For their manager to notice
For a formal opportunity
For the “right” timing
For confidence to magically appear

After working with dozens of developers and reviewing lots of React code, I’ve noticed a pattern. Many developers write code that works fine during development but leads to subtle bugs and frustrating user experiences in production.
These issues often show up when real users interact with the app, leading to bounce rates, lost user trust, or even lost revenue.
In this post, I’ll break down 10 common mistakes I see (and have made myself), plus practical ways to fix them. The goal: move from "it works on my machine" to "this feels great for everyone."

One bug. 45 minutes. Nearly dead.
This is the domino effect in action.

In software:
Fix one bug → Create two new bugs
Change one line of code → Break three features
Update one library → Crash the entire app

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rust offers different ways to initialize compile time-initialized variables. Recently, I had to create a runtime-initialized variable: existing approaches don't work in this case. I want to describe multiple ways to achieve it in this post.
The Rust language allows you to create constants. Two keywords are available: const and static.
Sometimes a certain value is used many times throughout a program, and it can become inconvenient to copy it over and over. What’s more, it’s not always possible or desirable to make it a variable that gets carried around to each function that needs it. In these cases, the const keyword provides a convenient alternative to code duplication:
const THING: u32 = 0xABAD1DEA;

let foo = 123 + THING;

Unfortunately, this info is only visible if 100+ repositories depend on your project.
That sucks because I maintain several open source libraries like jekyll-auto-authors that have dozens of real users and I'd love to showcase that information despite the thresholds.
So I built dependents.info — a simple tool that shows your network dependents right inside your README!
