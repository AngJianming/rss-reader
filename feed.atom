Understanding the Custom Caret Cursor
A custom caret cursor allows you to replace the default cursor with a unique design, such as a water drop icon. This customization can make the editing experience more engaging, especially on touchscreen devices where interactions are different. However, one common issue arises when using touch events: the Ace Editor's cursor may jump to the tip of the finger, causing it to be invisible when the handle is touched.
Why the Cursor Jumps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[web-server is a software application that manages and serves web content efficiently, making websites accessible to users anytime ,anywhere.Responsible for receiving HTTP requests from client and responding with request responses,such HTML pages,images,CSS files,JavaScript etc.
How do web-servers work?.
1 A user Requests a web-page
a user types https://example.com in their browser then the browser translates this into  HTTP request.
2 DNS Resolution

The browser ask the DNS(Domain Name System) to translate the domain(example.com) into an IP address(e.g,192.168.100)
3 Connection to the Server
4 web-server Receives requests
The server (running software like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) receives the request, e.g., "GET /index.html HTTP/1.1".
5 Processing the requests
The web-server looks for the requested file (index.html) in it's directory, if it's a dynamic site using python,PHP,Node-js ,it process the request using it's back-end logic.
6 Response is Sent back
The server sends a response back with a status code like 200 OK or 404 Not Found
.
7 Browser Renders the Content Back
The browser receives the response and renders the page.It may then request additional resources like CSS, JS, or images, repeating the cycle.
Types of Web-servers.
Common web-server Available.
1 Apache HTTP Server:it is an open source and free web-server Compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS X, Unix, Linux, and Solaris .licensed under Apache Software foundation.
2 Microsoft IIS – developed and owned by micro-soft which is privately owned ,runs on Microsoft platforms only.
3 Nginx – High-performance, great for static files and reverse proxy.it is an open source web-server highly recommended by many
4 LiteSpeed – Known for speed and low memory usage.]]></summary>

These moving national landmarks have been continually operating since 1873. This technology relies on tracks and a robust underlying cable technology, mostly hidden away from the public eye. This made SF the perfect backdrop for conversations about a modern technology that needs tracks and guardrails: agentic AI. 
If there was a common thread among the conversations at this year's RSA Conference, it was the emergence of agentic AI as an operational "colleague," not just a tool. This path poses a lot of questions for trust, governance, and identity in security. We are no longer merely integrating AI; we're now onboarding it.

This post explores the innovative Simple Public License 2.0 (SimPL 2.0) by delving into its origins, core concepts, and its role in fair code licensing. We outline its background, key features, use cases, challenges, and prospects for future innovation. With comparisons to other open source licenses and discussions on dual licensing and blockchain integration, we aim to provide clear, technical yet accessible insights into how SimPL 2.0 paves the way for a more equitable open source ecosystem.
The evolution of open source licensing has spurred efforts to create frameworks that not only promote innovation but also ensure that developers receive fair treatment.

For this serie, I wanna post my LeetCode solutions; everytime when I achive 100% in runtime analysis or at least 80% in memory efficiency, I will share my code here. 
Posts will follow leetcode model:

Another simple two pointers trick. Let a pointer for the first item of array (call it index). Then use another pointer to search, keep waiting a different item to appear. At this time, just increase by one our index pointer and copy the value pointed by the other one.
We will build a "for loop", is easy to loop through array with this loop. We'll need to mutable vars, one to hold our "lazy" pointer, the one that memorized the next index, and another for search, this var will be updated just when the index value became different from the search pointer.
Time complexity:
Space complexity:
impl Solution {
    pub fn remove_duplicates(nums: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
      let mut lastNonDup = nums[0];
      let mut new_size= 1;

        for index in 0..nums.len() {
            if nums[index] != lastNonDup {
                nums[new_size] = nums[index];

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, was hit by a $20 million extortion attempt after cybercriminals recruited overseas support agents to leak user data, the company said.
According to a May 15 blog post, Coinbase said a group of external actors bribed and coordinated with several customer support contractors to access internal systems and steal limited user account data.
“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” Coinbase said, adding that no passwords, private keys, funds or Coinbase Prime accounts were affected.
Less than 1% of Coinbase’s monthly transacting users’ data was affected by the attack, the company said.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in a month after forming a local low at $1.80. Improving risk appetite and prospects of an “altseason” have boosted its price.
Could XRP rally further from current levels or risk a pullback in the coming days? Let’s examine.

The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT), which are then held as collateral.
“USP is backed 1:1 by the stablecoins used during the minting process,” Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.
The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Too many crypto startups are pricing themselves out of venture capital funding by chasing valuations far exceeding their revenues, according to Dan Tapeiro, the CEO of crypto-focused venture capital firm 10T Holdings.
“For some reason, founders and CEOs think that they should be raising capital at 50 to 80 times revenue. So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14.
“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.
