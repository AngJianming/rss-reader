A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>

This typically means your EMR service role (EMR_DefaultRole) does not have the required permissions to launch EC2 instances for your cluster.
Step 1: Check CloudTrail for Details
Go to AWS CloudTrail and look for RunInstances events around the time your cluster failed.
User: arn:aws:sts::xxx:assumed-role/EMR_DefaultRole/CCSSession is not authorized to perform: ec2:RunInstances on resource: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:xxx:subnet/subnet-02xxx because no identity-based policy allows the ec2:RunInstances action
Step 2: Understand the Cause
Key: for-use-with-amazon-emr-managed-policies


If your subnet or security group is not tagged this way, EMR cannot launch instances in it.
Step 3: Solution — Add the Required Tag
Go to the AWS Console → VPC → Subnets.
Key: for-use-with-amazon-emr-managed-policies

Repeat for any security groups referenced by your EMR cluster.
Step 4: Retry Your EMR Cluster
After tagging, re-launch your EMR cluster.
It should now have the permissions needed to launch EC2 instances.]]></summary>

At Streamline, we aim to make creators’ workflows as smooth as possible. That’s why we’ve built plugins for platforms like Figma, Framer, Lucid, Desktop, and Web. But let’s face it—as developers, we’re also creators, and more often than not, we have to deal with icons for our frontends.
Even with JSX support, I often found myself stuck in a repetitive cycle just to use our own icons in code:
Go to StreamlineHQ.com → Download the icon SVG → Open the Downloads folder → Move the file to /assets → Import it → Want to change it? Go back to step one.
So we decided it was time to show some love to our dev community by bringing the power of Streamline to your favorite code editor: Visual Studio Code.

Microservices Architecture is a way of building software where each part of the system (called a service) does one thing really well.
Instead of one big “do-it-all” program (called a monolith), we create many small, focused apps that work together. Each microservice handles a specific task, like managing users, showing products, or handling payments.
Let’s say we’re building an online shopping app like Amazon.

The round is 30 minutes long, and the difficulty is easy.
The round was focused mainly on React. 
Before the interview, the HR asked me if I had experience with React, Redux, etc.
Since this is the first round, they focused on just the basics. Here are some of the questions asked - 
What are hooks, and how are they an improvement over class components?
What are some optimisation techniques in React?
What is Git, and how does it help in development?
What styling library is used in React, and are there any drawbacks to using it over styled components? I'm guessing they use Styled Components at the company.
What are controlled and uncontrolled components?
How to write custom hooks?
How to do unit testing in React?
What is the difference between useEffect and useState?
How to make a retry mechanism in API calling and failing in React?
How to handle errors in API calls in React and show them to the user?
Will update if I hear from them again for the next rounds!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luxembourg classified virtual asset service providers (VASPs) as high-risk entities for money laundering in its 2025 National Risk Assessment (NRA), highlighting concerns over the crypto industry’s exposure to financial crime.
According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

Metaplanet’s stockholders are paying more than a fivefold premium on Bitcoin (BTC) when investing in the Japanese company, according to a report by 10x Research published on May 27.
“A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price,” the report states.
Investors who don’t understand the importance of a firm’s net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure” on a position that doesn’t provide additional upside leverage, the report adds.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.
“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Those arrested include several minors, with charges against them including kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and criminal conspiracy, Le Parisien reported on May 26.
French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.
In one recent alleged kidnapping attempt on May 13, three men tried to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, in broad daylight in Paris.

The World Robot Competition Mecha Fighting Series had four human-controlled robots built by China-based firm Unitree compete in three, two-minute rounds with winners crowned through a points system, according to a May 26 report from the China state-owned outlet the Global Times. 
Chen Xiyun, a Unitree team member, said the “robots fight in a human-machine collaborative way,” with the machines pre-taught moves, but ultimately, a person controls the bot’s movements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.
“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.
