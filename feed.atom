it’s time to rethink what “React” can really do.
Let’s dive into how you can build an AI-focused niche startup with React—without trying to be the next OpenAI clone.
React is just the UI layer, right?
foundational weapon to productize niche AI tools. You don’t need a PhD in machine learning. You just need:
A weird idea.
A solid frontend.
A few APIs.
And the right kind of hacker energy.
Let me explain.
The goldmine isn’t in building yet another chatbot—it’s in crafting functional apps that appeal to technical misfits, tinkerers, indie hackers, and yes, the DIY crowd.
Think:
AI-powered fake user simulation tools for QA testers
Data-skimming dashboards that visualize scraped info (for researchers or journalists)
Nostalgia simulators for legacy systems (yes, emulat…]]></summary>

You’ve got the React skills.
You want to build a blog, or a newsletter, or a knowledge base...
What if you could skip the writing and still launch something valuable?
Forget the AI fluff and the SEO circus.
Curated, weird, smart content
Already-written articles you license and remix

A React front-end that feels like your own personal hacker zine
You become the editor, not the writer.
Here’s what works best:
weirdly curious about.
Examples:
🛠 DIY computing and hardware hacking
🤖 Bots, fake traffic, and fake engagement
👾 Hacker culture and underground techniques
🧠 Psychological control via tech
💀 Infamous tech flops and failures
🧬 Lost, obscure, or forgotten tech

You know what everyone has also been talking about? How great vibe coding is. Oh, and also how awful it is.
But what if we could get the best of both worlds? Enter what I'm calling "vibe-but-verify coding".
Vibe coding, for the rock-dwellers out there, is when you "forget the code exists" and let AI do all the coding for you. You tell it to do the thing, and it does the thing, with much greater ability and speed than you could have (in theory).
The problem is when it doesn't do the thing, or does it in a dumb way. Coders and non-coders alike get stuck when the AI traps itself in error spirals or repeatedly breaks existing functionality, never finishing that las…]]></summary>

In today's web development landscape, securing your APIs is paramount. User authentication is a critical first step in ensuring only authorized users can access your application's resources. In this post, we'll dive into a practical implementation of a secure user login system using Node.js, Express, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). We'll explore input validation, database interaction, and the generation of access and refresh tokens.

I'm Aruna Subramanian,a pre-final year B.Tech Information Technology student with deep passion for learning and exploring technology
As a Beginner,I Started my journey with Web development and I came to know about MERN Stack.That was actually a turning point.I got the opportunity to attend a bootcamp on MERN Stack organized in our insitute by Rampex Technologies.I'm really grateful to my Mentor,Mr.Mohan Raj ,He didn't just teach us the technical concepts,he also shared many valuable real-world experiences  and often spoke about the power of tech Community.
His mentorship truly inspired me.Since then,I've started building MERN stack applications on my own,and the learning hasn't stopped.
Beyond just learning,I've been passionate about mentoring and sharing knowledge.I love guiding others,and that led me and my friend Hemalatha to start mentoring our juniors.
This blend of learning and guiding made me realize:
Mentorpreneur and I'm proud of it.
We aim to keep growing this journey,helping others while growing ourselves.
This is my very first post here and i'm excited about it!
I decided to start writing here 
To track my learning journey.
To build the habit of journaling things I learn.
To give back by sharing insights that might help others starting out.
And to become a better communicator and thinker through writing.
I will be using this space to write about my experiences learning tools and techologies that i'm exploring.
Thank you for reading!!🙌
If you're also a student,learner,or mentor.I'd love to connect,collaborate and grow together.]]></summary>

And i just finished it a little core, you all can see in my YouTube channel (i'm brazillan so it is in Portuguese).
My virtual machime don't have a cool name, so you all can give me good ideas :D and have simple commands :
0x00 = null - cost 0 bytes
0x01 = put - cost 3 bytes
0x02 = get to register - cost 3 bytes
0x03 = copy a register to other register - cost 3 bytes
0x04 = addiction of two registers - cost 3 bytes
0x05 = subtraction of two registers - cost 3 bytes
0x06 = jump to a slot in partition - cost 2 bytes
0x07 = jump to a slot in partition if register 4 == 1 - cost 3 bytes
0x08 = print a register value in screen - cost 2 bytes
0x09 = compare 2 registers and store in register 4 - cost 3 bytes
0xff = halt - cost 1 byte

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

According to a May 12 X post, Backpack now allows FTX EU users who selected it as the redistribution platform to claim their euro balance. Users must first complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
Backpack’s support page also said that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU:
“If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.”

The BIS study, published May 8, found cross-border payments using the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and the two largest stablecoins, USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), totaled about $600 billion during the second quarter of 2024, the final observation period covered by the analysis.

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.

In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.
While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. 
At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. 
Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation an…]]></summary>

“The defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they wrote. “Nothing more is warranted.”

DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.
Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.

There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now.

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
