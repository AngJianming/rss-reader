üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, used to generate files dynamically. Think of it like Mad Libs for config files, where you can inject variables into a template and programmatically generate output.
It‚Äôs used heavily in:
Any scenario where you want to avoid copy-paste hell üî•
Infrastructure as Code (Ansible, SaltStack)
Web frameworks (like Flask or Django)
Easy to learn if you have experience some template engine such as Laravel Blade, Twig, Haml, 11ty
### üéØ Why Use Jinja?
Use Jinja when you want to:
Reduce human errors by avoiding repetitive copy-paste
Dynamically change parameters like server names, ports, or environments
Reusable: You can write once and render thousands of variations. Efficiency FTW.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When discussing latency and throughput, they are often framed in the context of networking. However, these metrics are just as critical when evaluating application and server performance. In applications, latency measures how quickly a request is processed and responded to, while throughput reflects how many requests or transactions a system can handle within a given timeframe. Optimizing both is essential to ensure fast, efficient operations, especially in high-demand environments. Understanding how these metrics apply to applications‚Äîand how to balance them‚Äîcan drastically improve user experience and system scalability.

According to Hut8‚Äôs latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm‚Äôs CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
‚ÄúAs reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,‚Äù Genoot said. ‚ÄúWe believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.‚Äù
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience.¬†

Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on May 7, which allows Arizona to claim ownership of abandoned digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications within three years.
The state‚Äôs custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.
‚ÄúThis law ensures Arizona doesn‚Äôt leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,‚Äù the bill‚Äôs sponsor, Jeff Weninger, said in a May‚Ä¶]]></summary>

According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company's local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. 
Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
