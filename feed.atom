        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost 60,000 Bitcoin addresses tied to LockBit’s ransomware infrastructure were leaked after hackers breached the group’s dark web affiliate panel. 
The leak included a MySQL database dump shared publicly online. It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows.  
Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.
LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused bi…]]></summary>

The FX3G and FX3U PLCs are excellent solutions for small to medium-sized automation projects. Their affordability and compatibility with budget-friendly, China-made devices further enhance their appeal, making them an attractive choice for many engineers and developers.
However, these PLCs come with certain limitations—particularly in the IDE environment. I primarily use GX Works 2, and while it provides Structured Text (ST) programming, its implementation is fairly restricted compared to even older versions like CoDeSys 2.3. That said, the fact that ST is available at all is a significant advantage. Despite its limitations, GX Works 2 remains highly capable of solving most automation tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Manufacturing has always been a complex dance of materials, machines, and manpower. But in the age of Industry 4.0, this dance is becoming increasingly orchestrated by artificial intelligence. Smart factories are leveraging AI to automate one of the most critical — and traditionally inflexible — components of production: scheduling.
At a glance, production scheduling seems straightforward — align machines, materials, and manpower to meet delivery targets. But developers and system engineers working in manufacturing tech know how deep the rabbit hole goes: real-time constraint handling, machine availability, order priorities, predictive maintenance data, and more.
Here's how AI is changing the game:
AI scheduling engines use reinforcement learning and constraint programming to simulate optimal workflows.
Digital twins enable testing of scheduling scenarios before real-world deployment.
IoT data integration supports real-time responsiveness to production floor events.
Predictive analytics anticipate demand spikes, raw material shortages, and equipment failures.
This means software architects are now designing systems that not only collect data but act on it in milliseconds — a feat that's rewriting efficiency benchmarks across industries.
💡 Read how AI scheduling is being implemented in smart factory environments and what tech stacks and architectures are driving this shift:

Access control refers to the cybersecurity practice of determining whether a user, API, application, or device (requesting party) should have access to a resource, system, or service or perform an action. This process is called authentication (verifying the identity of the requesting party) and authorization (determining their access rights). 
OAuth 2.0 has become the go-to protocol for authorization and access delegation, which facilitates fast and secure authentication and authorization for users to APIs, servers, devices, and apps. This is done without sharing any user credentials, like passwords. Instead, access tokens are used to prove an identity, keeping user credentials safe. By using a centralized OAuth server to issue tokens, you can achieve fine-grained access con…]]></summary>

Benefits of boundary values are tester can effectively identified the bugs which was commonly missed by other validation techniques, especially boundary cases.Also BAV will helps to reduces the test effort by concentrating high risk values.


In BAV, tester can targets the edges of input where the defects are more likely to the surface.Also it includes minimum and maximum input values just inside and outside of boundaries.In BAV technique testers don't need knowledge of the software about internal logic and source code.]]></summary>

Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…]]></summary>

According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company's local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. 
Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?

The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.

Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment.
