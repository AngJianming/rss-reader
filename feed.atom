REST API is the HTTP interface following REST principles to manipulate resources. This quick refresher looks at some common concepts and its application in Divooka.
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is the de-facto style for web services: roughly 8 out of 10 public APIs you’ll meet follow it, so mastering the basics lets you speak to almost any modern backend.(Integrate.io)
A REST API exposes resources (nouns such as /users/42) over plain HTTP. Clients use standard verbs to act on those resources:



Verb
Typical intent
Idempotent?




GET

POST
Create / adj. action

PUT
Replace

PATCH

RESTful servers must also follow six architectural constraints (uniform interface, client-server, stateless, cacheable, layered, code …]]></summary>

What Is the Linux Command Line?


The command line (or terminal) is where you type text commands to control the computer directly.
Linux is built around the command line. You can create files, move around, install software — all by typing commands.
Most Useful Basic Commands






  
  
  1. pwd – Where am I?


This shows your current location (folder) in the computer.
pwd

Example output:
/home/yourname

2. ls – What is here?


Shows files and folders in the current location.
ls

You can also use options:
ls -l: more details (like size and date)
ls -a: show hidden files (start with .)
3. cd – Go to another folder


This moves you into a different folder.
cd foldername        # Go into a folder
cd ..   …]]></summary>

A queue is a data structure that works like a line of people — the first to come in is the first to get served. It follows the FIFO principle: First-In, First-Out.
Implementing queues using arrays is straightforward, but it comes with some challenges. Here we will explain step-by-step why certain techniques are used, especially why circular arrays are helpful. We will also go over the common “full vs empty” confusion and the "n-1 vs n slots" issue by showing two different circular-array based queue implementations.
Imagine a simple array of size 5:



Index
0
1
2
3

We can use this array to represent a Queue. We will use two pointers:

But Mongoose, while handy, is not foolproof. As your app grows or moves into production, small mistakes can snowball into performance bottlenecks, inconsistent data, memory leaks, or even full-on crashes.
Not Handling Mongoose Connection Properly



  
  
  The Mistake:


A lot of developers connect to MongoDB using something like:
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb');

But what if the connection fails? Or MongoDB is temporarily down? Many ignore the promise returned by mongoose.connect() and never listen for connection errors.

1. What is Python?


Python is a tool we use to give instructions to a computer.
programming language — a way to write tasks in simple, readable English-like words so the computer can follow them.
2. What is a Program?


A program is a list of instructions that a computer runs step by step.
To write a program in Python, we write instructions using Python’s rules (called syntax). The instructions tell the computer what to do with data (numbers, text, etc.).
3. What is Data?


Data is information — like:
Numbers (10)
Text ("hello")
True/False values (True, False)
Every piece of data has a type. Common types in Python:
int: whole numbers like 5


float: decimal numbers like 3.14


str: text like "Python"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[React 19 just dropped, and it’s not your usual version bump. After exploring it hands-on through a real-world project, I was blown away by how much better React is becoming — both for developers and users.
Here are some of the game-changing highlights from React 19 that stood out:
No more juggling fetch logic inside event handlers. With the new Actions API, you can define server actions easily:
"use server";

export async function submitForm(data) {
  // Server-side logic
}

Built-in form support and better code separation = ❤️
useOptimistic Hook — Real-Time, Lag-Free UI


This hook lets you update the UI before a server response lands — perfect for comment systems, likes, etc.
const [optimisticItems, addItem] = useOptimistic(
  items,
  (state, newItem) => [...state, newItem]
);

I used this in a feedback feature — the experience felt instant.
React now supports a native metadata export:
export const metadata = {
  title: "React 19 Blog",
  description: "Big updates in React 19 you should care about",
};

No more react-helmet, no more hacks. SEO is now baked in.
<Form> Component — Simpler than react-hook-form


Use it like this:
<form action={submitForm}>
  <input name="email" required />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

No context juggling or custom handlers. It just works.™
React now handles image/font/script loading much better when paired with Next.js and RSC. This means cleaner hydration, faster rendering, and less boilerplate.
React 19 isn’t just about features. It’s about making modern development faster, cleaner, and more realistic for production-scale apps.
