Dell is not just embracing the AI revolution—they’re enabling it, scaling it, and humanizing it.
From smart cities to retail floors, Dell’s rugged servers and edge-optimized AI PCs are transforming how decisions are made. Lowe’s, for example, is deploying AI-infused micro data centers inside stores to power computer vision and real-time customer assistance.
These systems generate tens of trillions of tokens per month, running the world’s most advanced LLMs. Future systems are already being designed to scale to 1 million GPUs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dizziness and vertigo are common complaints, but many people confuse the two terms. While both affect your sense of balance, they are distinct conditions with different causes and treatment methods. Dizziness is a general term that describes the feeling of being lightheaded or unsteady, while vertigo refers to the sensation that you or your surroundings are spinning, even when you are not moving.
Both dizziness and vertigo can significantly impact your daily activities and quality of life. Whether you feel a mild sense of imbalance or experience episodes of intense spinning, it’s important to understand what’s normal and when it’s time to consult a medical professional, particularly an ENT specialist, for a comprehensive evaluation.

If you’ve ever wanted to spin up a full-fledged Kubernetes cluster for learning, testing, or demonstrating tooling—without touching the cloud or provisioning anything beyond your laptop—this guide is for you.
We'll be using Vagrant to automate the provisioning of virtual machines and Ansible to configure them into a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster. This setup gives you a reproducible, portable lab that mirrors real-world infrastructure—perfect for experiments, CI, or training.
Let’s dive into the setup.

We'll build a 3-node Kubernetes cluster:

This article summarizes the steps I took and the considerations I encountered during the upgrade process.
Upgrading PHP from version 7.4 to 8.1.

OS Image: Amazon Linux 2 Kernel 5.10
PHP Version: PHP 7.4.33 (cli)
PHPUnit Version: 9.5.28
CakePHP Version: 4.2.12

Each PHP version is supported for three years (2 years active support + 1 year security support).
PHP Supported Versions
First, I reviewed the official documentation for breaking changes:
Migrating from PHP 7.4.x to PHP 8.0.x
Migrating from PHP 8.0.x to PHP 8.1.x
As I was using PHPUnit for testing code, I also checked compatibility between PHP and PHPUnit.
