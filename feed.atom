Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a set of rules that defines how communication between an MCP client and an MCP server should be managed in order to utilize third-party services effectively.
Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) is an open protocol that allows agents to interoperate across different ecosystems, frameworks, or organizations. It supports a dynamic, multi-agent environment where agents can communicate, discover each other, and collaborate autonomously.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript bundle size is one of the leading factors affecting web performance. A large bundle can delay initial load times, frustrate users, and hurt Core Web Vitals. In 2025, as web apps grow in complexity, code splitting remains a vital optimization strategy.
In this post, we’ll explore code splitting, why it matters, and how to implement it using modern tools like React, Vite, Next.js, and dynamic import().
Before diving into techniques, let's clarify why reducing your JavaScript bundle size is so important:
⌛ Improved Time-to-Interactive (TTI)

📉 Lower First Input Delay (FID)

📡 Reduced bandwidth usage on mobile/slow networks

🔄 Faster reloads for SPAs and PWAs

I’m Aksh — currently a student and I'm still figuring out stuff in this whole programming/dev world 😅. Finally writing a post here and introduce myself.
Right now, I’m learning C, C++, Java, and Python. Also getting into web dev — the basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a lot sometimes, but I’m starting to enjoy the process.
Recently started focusing more on DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms). It's challenging, but I’m trying to stay consistent and build up my problem-solving game.
I’ve also been exploring full-stack dev — mostly looking at Django and how backend stuff works. Just taking it one step at a time.
Why I'm here?
That’s all for now.
If you’re also like me figuring things out, learning new stuff and all— let’s connect.

The textbook definition was simple enough:
"Each transaction should run as if it's the only one in the system."
But what does that actually look like? I kept staring at this definition thinking, "Okay, but how do you even see that happening?" I couldn't visualize it, so naturally, I went down a rabbit hole.
Here's what clicked for me: isolation isn't just "on" or "off." There's actually a whole spectrum of isolation behaviors, and databases let you pick your poison through something called Isolation Levels.

Distributed scheduling solves three fundamental problems in automation systems:
High Availability: Eliminates single points of failure. If one node goes down, others continue operating.
Horizontal Scalability: Allows adding more nodes to handle increased load rather than being limited by a single machine's capacity.
Consistency: Through careful design patterns, we can maintain reliable execution across nodes.
Our social media automation service needs to:
Schedule posts across multiple platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn)
Handle AI-generated content and images
Maintain execution reliability across distributed nodes
Provide execution history and failure recovery

A SecurityContext in Kubernetes defines privilege and access control settings for pods or containers, allowing you to control how processes run, access resources, and interact with the system. It is a critical component for securing Kubernetes workloads by enforcing least-privilege principles.
Pod-Level SecurityContext: Applies security settings to all containers in a pod and can affect the pod’s volumes. It’s defined under spec.securityContext.
Container-Level SecurityContext: Applies to a specific container and can override pod-level settings for that container. It’s defined under spec.containers[].securityContext.
The key difference is scope:
Pod-level settings provide a baseline for all containers and volumes in the pod.

When starting with Azure infrastructure as code (IaC), Terraform is one of the most powerful tools available. In this post, we’ll walk through how to use Terraform to create a basic network setup on Azure — including a Resource Group, Virtual Network (VNet), and Subnet. This is an ideal starting point for beginners who want to automate infrastructure deployment.
The project consists of four core Terraform files:
Each file serves a specific purpose and keeps the configuration modular and easy to manage.
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
Virtual Network


Subnet



🚀 How to Deploy
Step 1: Login to Azure
Step 2: Initialize Terraform
Step 3: Preview the Plan
Step 4: Apply the Configuration
Type yes when prompted to confirm, and Terraform will begin creating the resources on Azure.
✅ Conclusion
In future posts, I plan to share:
How to deploy Azure Virtual Machines with NSGs
How to create snapshots and managed images
Comparing Terraform and Bicep for infrastructure as code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has drawn criticism from the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and questioning the asset’s value because it can’t be eaten.
“You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.
Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…]]></summary>

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.
