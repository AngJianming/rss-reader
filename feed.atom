In the current landscape of new product development, the primary risk lies in the product's ability to gain a market fit rather than technological advancements. Entrepreneurs and investors have limited resources, including time and funding, to ensure the success of their products. To minimize waste, it is crucial to prioritize investment in strategies that address the most critical risks. Venture Capital (VC) evaluates potential startups with various methods, predominantly utilizing numerical indicators like engagement and revenue quality. However, for early-stage startups that may lack these indicators or face misleading data, VCs must rely on a blended approach of qualitative and quantitative proxies to understand the progress and direction of the product.

But between setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring environments, and managing infrastructure, cloud deployment can easily become a time sink.
So what tools actually help streamline the cloud deployment process in 2025? 
Let's break it down, developer-to-developer.
Before jumping into tools, let’s talk real-world benefits.
When your deployment workflow is smooth:
You save time (and sanity)
You reduce the risk of breaking production
You get faster feedback from users
You can focus more on building, less on babysitting servers

It's a common task, particularly when working with time durations in applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to efficiently perform this conversion with a straightforward approach and clear code examples.
Understanding the Conversion Process
When you have a number of seconds, the goal is to break it down into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds. For example, converting '685' seconds into '00:11:25' involves:
Calculating Hours: By dividing the total seconds by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
Calculating Remaining Minutes: By taking the remaining seconds after accounting for hours and dividing by 60.
Calculating Remaining Seconds: By taking the remainder from the minutes calcul…]]></summary>

Each day, the Scraper ventured out, gathering essential tools—brake pads, spark plugs, and oil filters—meticulously putting them in his storage room. This storage room, filled with parts, was like a database, organizing all the precious data he gathered from various sources.
For instance, one day, the Scraper found a batch of brake pads. He cataloged the details, from brand to condition, and stored it safely. This was like collecting the latest prices from websites, storing them in a file for future use.
The Backend Guy: The Toolbox Handler
Whenever the mechanic—the Frontend—needed a specific tool, they would call out, “I need a 10mm wrench!” The Backend Guy, standing by the toolbox, would find the correct tool and hand it over with precision. He didn't fix the car himself, but he made sure the mechanic had exactly what was needed at the right time.
Just like that, the Backend Guy managed the storage of all the data and ensured it was always ready when the Frontend needed it. When the mechanic asked for the current price of the Euro in Toman, the Backend would retrieve that data and send it in a neat package—a JSON response—ready to be used.
The Frontend Mechanic: The User Interface
When the mechanic needed a part, they'd shout, "I need a 10mm wrench!" The Backend Guy would respond, handing over the tool, and the Frontend Mechanic would get to work. The mechanic didn’t care how the part got there, as long as it was the right one.
In the same way, the Frontend Mechanic used the data provided by the Backend to create an amazing display for the car's dashboard. They made sure the car (or website) looked stunning, with neatly organized parts (like the prices) and a smooth-running engine (user interface). Whether it was showing prices in a nice table or providing a simple, user-friendly experience, the Frontend Mechanic made sure everything was visually appealing and functional.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has come a long way since its beginnings. What started as spinning up cloud resources has now grown into a full-blown ecosystem with a very engaged community. IaC on its own can add a lot of complexity to your processes and cause more issues, but combined with governance, compliance, security, deployment strategies, self-service, it easily becomes the fuel your delivery engine needs.
This year, IaCConf debuts as a virtual event by bringing together this community, and it’s shaping up to be one of the most relevant and practical events in the space.
Unlike broader DevOps/SRE or cloud-native events, IACConf is focused on the challenges and innovations around defining infrastructure as code. That means the content goes deeper, the conversations are more relevant, and the takeaways are directly applicable to your processes.
There will be sessions on:
Getting started with IaC
Managing IaC at scale across teams and environments (using OpenTofu, Terraform, Ansible, Crossplane, and others)
Platform Engineering and IaC
How IaC impacts your maturity
AI in IaC
And that’s just scratching the surface. Check out the full agenda here.
One of the things I appreciate most about this conference is that it’s not about product pitches or high-level fluff. Practitioners share what worked, what broke, and how they improved. Whether you are just starting out, are in the trenches, or shaping platform strategy, there’s something for you here.
On another note, I’m also excited to contribute to this year’s lineup with a session on Getting Started with IaC, together with my colleague Emin Alemdar. But honestly, I’m just as excited to learn and to connect with others working through the same challenges.
The event will be on Thu, May 15, 2025 @ 11:00am EDT, so don’t forget to register here.

I. Always SELECT Only the Columns You Need
SELECT *, especially when you're exploring data.
Bad example:
SELECT * FROM orders;

Better:
SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount FROM orders;

II. Use Proper Indexes
(WHERE), joining (JOIN), or sorting (ORDER BY).
If your query frequently filters on a column, it’s a strong candidate for indexing.
Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);

“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 
If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will …]]></summary>

In a May 5 letter to the Office of Government Ethics, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley said that Trump and his family stand to personally profit from an investment involving UAE state-backed firm MGX, crypto exchange Binance and World Liberty Financial (WLFI).
The senators called for an urgent probe, warning the deal may violate the US Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and federal bribery statutes.
At the center of the controversy is WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, reportedly chosen for a $2 billion investment MGX plans to make into Binance.

The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”

Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Department of the Treasury has sanctioned a Myanmar militia group known as the Karen National Army (KNA), accusing it of crypto-related scams and other criminal activities. 
According to a May 5 press release issued by the agency, the Karen National Army has been orchestrating a variety of crypto scams, including the infamous “pig butchering” scam, which lures victims into contributing more and more to fake crypto schemes. Americans “have collectively lost billions of dollars” from scams such as those emanating from Myanmar, the release reads, without specifying an amount.

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said, “teachers are going the extra mile for their students’ education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms.” The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
