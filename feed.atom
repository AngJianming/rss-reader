Instead, I deleted it and replaced it. Memphis can now test itself across all engines.
What does this mean?
I can verify the treewalk interpreter and bytecode VM interpreter produce the same results (return value or symbol table entries) for a given snippet of Python.
This functionality is available in unit tests, rather than only in integration tests. In Rust, this means in src/ rather than tests/.
Let’s look at a couple of examples.
Any interpreter worth its table salt should be able to evaluate 2 + 2.

High-profile breaches and cyberattacks consistently expose how fragile password-based security really is. Below, we’ll examine two major case studies that highlight why passwords are failing us—and what we should use instead.  
Case Study 1: The LinkedIn Breach (2012, 2016, and Beyond)



  
  
  What Happened?



In 2012, LinkedIn suffered a breach that exposed 164 million email and password combinations.

Hackers didn’t just steal passwords—they cracked weak hashes (SHA-1 without salting), revealing plaintext credentials.

In 2016, another batch of 117 million passwords from the same breach resurfaced on the dark web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we will dive into part 7 in the shell scripting series. Today we will be looking at two scripts in order to check whether a particular service is running.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.



  
  
  1st Script:




Create the script in VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save it.


✅ What it does:
In Plain English:
Common use in scripts:


Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created and also it is in green colour – meaning the permissions have been applied to the script and therefore it is now executable.



Execute the script with ./



Output of the script once it has been executed. 





  
  
  2nd Script:




Create the script with VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save it.



Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created and also it is in green colour – meaning the permissions have been applied to the script and therefore it is now executable.



Execute the script with ./



Output of the script once executed.

In many languages, enums are used to represent states or flags by assigning consecutive integers or bit values (using things like iota() or auto()). A typical usage would be something like this in C++:
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    enum class Color { red, green = 20, blue };
    Color r = Color::blue;

    switch(r)
    {
        case Color::red  : std::cout << "red\n";   break;
        case Color::green: std::cout << "green\n"; break;
        case Color::blue : std::cout << "blue\n";  break;
    }
}

Bit-shifting (like 1 << 0, 1 << 1, etc.) is often used for flag enums too…]]></summary>

In JavaScript, Proxies act as intermediaries for objects, allowing you to customize fundamental behaviors such as property reading, value assignment, enumeration, function invocation, and even operations with the new operator. Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), Proxies remain underutilized by many developers, despite offering impressive possibilities.
A Proxy wraps a target object and defines traps that are triggered when specific operations are performed on the object. These traps allow you to intercept and customize JavaScript's default behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained when rollup-based layer-2 platforms should go decentralized, and why “as soon as possible” is not the correct answer.
In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:
“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …]]></summary>

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News’ Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he’s profiting from the presidency through the memecoin.
“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.
Like Andresen’s old website, Shrem’s page explains what Bitcoin is and how to receive Bitcoin.

The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The father of an unnamed crypto entrepreneur was freed by police in Paris, France, during a law enforcement raid of the property where the man was held captive for ransom over several days.
According to a report by Le Monde, the May 3 raid resulted in five arrests. Local outlet Le Parisien also said the kidnappers demanded between 5 million and 7 million euros, or up to $7.9 million, to release the captive man.
Although the details on the identity of the victims remain scant, likely for security reasons, the crypto entrepreneur and his father co-owned a crypto marketing firm based in Malta, French media reports.
This incident features similarities to the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland in France in January 2025. Balland was also held for a crypto ransom until he was freed by …]]></summary>

According to a report from the Financial Times, the agreement, which was signed on May 4, was done in the hopes of moving the Maldives away from reliance on tourism and fisheries by attracting foreign direct investment into blockchain and Web3 technologies.
The project outlines plans for the Maldives International Financial Centre, an 830,000-square-meter facility that will reportedly employ up to 16,000 individuals.

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.
Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.
