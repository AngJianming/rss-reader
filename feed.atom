But how is this happening? Are all these people really transferring from talking to humans to talking to machines? What does the language model operate behind these AIs? In 2025, there is no ambiguity between talking and chat bots. It's framed mostly by instruction and subsequently, output.
Of course, the ability for AI to talk like a human wasn't developed overnight either. Over the years, developments in large language processing models have created systems that operate on trillions of parameters - whereas previous iterations operated on mere billions. This difference of magnitude means that AI can better understand context, remember previous messages and conversations, and stay on task within one stream of consciousness across lengthier periods.

The chat experience has changed exponentially. Who would have thought that such advancements would be made in the world of chat? Those annoying automated systems from 2021, barely able to comprehend an easy yes or no question, are worlds apart from what 2025 holds. Yet, we know what 2025 holds - and these new AI companions don't just get what we're saying - they empathize and connect on increasingly human levels.
It's not just a technical advancement. The chat experience involves protections and boundaries that change the ways in which humans and machines communicate and interact at previously human-only levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structured Query Language (SQL) is an essential tool for working with databases, but even seasoned developers sometimes make mistakes that can lead to slow queries, inaccurate data, and inefficient systems.
When summarizing data, the GROUP BY clause organizes information into meaningful groups. However, misusing GROUP BY can lead to incorrect results—sometimes without obvious errors.
A database tracks employee salaries per department. Someone writes:
sql
To summarize salaries by department, the query should be:
sql
sql
Only group necessary columns—non-grouped columns need aggregate functions. 
Use HAVING instead of WHERE for filtering grouped results:
sql
During testing, SELECT * is quick and handy. But in production? It slows queries, overloads networks, and makes applications harder to maintain.
sql
sql
Explicitly specify needed columns instead of SELECT *.
Use LIMIT for large queries:
sql
sql
sql
Indexes speed up data retrieval, but poorly designed indexes can slow down updates, inserts, and deletes.
sql
A better strategy:
sql
Index columns frequently used in WHERE clauses. 
Avoid over-indexing, which slows write operations.
Use EXPLAIN or ANALYZE to check query performance:
sql
Use composite indexes only when queries filter by multiple columns:
sql
NULL values represent missing information, and if not handled correctly, they can cause errors or misleading results.
This query calculates average salaries:
sql
Ensure NULLs are accounted for:
sql
sql
Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to prevent logic errors. 
Replace NULLs using COALESCE() or IFNULL():
sql
Validate NULL handling in reports to avoid misleading calculations.
SQL mistakes can affect speed, accuracy, and system stability. But with the right practices, you can write efficient, optimized queries that scale well.
GROUP BY must include all non-aggregated columns to avoid incorrect grouping. 
Never use SELECT * in production—fetch only required data. 
Index smartly, targeting commonly searched fields. 
Handle NULLs carefully, ensuring accurate calculations.]]></summary>

Conversational AI development has accelerated exponentially beyond expected growth. AI's don't just answer questions anymore - they appreciate sarcasm, recall prior conversations, operate with an emotional intelligence sensitivity to sympathizing with human responses, and even steer conversations in such a way that they'll ensure the best possible user experience.

“You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.”
Whether we like it or not, AI is the most powerful tool we have today for building software — from generating boilerplate CRUD code, to setting up secure authentication systems, to designing architectural solutions for complex business problems.
This leaves many developers wondering where they will fit in the future of software development.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams noted the achievement in an X post on May 12, which included a screenshot of a Dune Analytics dashboard counting down to the milestone. 
Uniswap also has a current daily volume of $3.3 billion, according to Dune. DeFillama meanwhile shows Uniswap is the leading DEX with a 23% market share in daily volumes, which it reports as slightly lower at $3 billion over the past 24 hours. 
The second-largest DEX in volume is PancakeSwap, with $2.7 billion and a 21% DEX market share. 
Uniswap has a current total value locked of just under $5 billion. However, this figure is around half of its 2021 all-time high, as overall DeFi to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto users could be looking for a more sustainable yield this cycle, as total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending continues to hit new highs while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have lagged in comparison.
DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.
Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.

According to police, the incident occurred last November. The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. 
There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. 
The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,…]]></summary>

On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”

According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company's products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…]]></summary>

“There were definitely moments over the last 12 years where we thought, man, should we put 80% of our balance sheet into crypto — into Bitcoin specifically,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg in a May 9 video call.
Armstrong said the Bitcoin (BTC) strategy could have risked the company’s cash position and potentially killed the crypto exchange. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he added.

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the "loss of chance" claim made against Binance for delisting the token should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages in the original case.
