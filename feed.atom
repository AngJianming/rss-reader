Can you do something about it? Absolutely.
Wait wait, before you assume this is just another “vibe coding” motivational slop, I promise, it’s not.
I use LLMs all the time; for ideation, boilerplate, and prototyping. But I don’t vibe code. Even if I did, I’d still outperform most because of the fundamentals I’ve been sharpening since 2018.
I have two goals with this post:
Help you move past the fear of AI, it’s legit crippling.
Remind you that X (Twitter) is not a real place, it's mostly noise.
Why should you listen to me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basics of Screen Technology
LCD Screens
Use a white LED backlight.
Liquid crystals control light passing through color filters.
Thicker screen, lower cost.
Longer lifespan, less eye strain.
Blacks appear grayish due to backlight.
OLED Screens
Pixels emit their own light (no backlight).
Thinner, flexible displays.
Higher cost, shorter lifespan.
True blacks and vivid colors.
Faster response, but possible flicker and burn-in.
Why LCD Remains Popular
More affordable for mass repairs.
Less eye strain during extended use.
Longer durability, ideal for refurbished phones.
NCC Display Solutions
LCD Options: Cost-effective, bright, durable, compatible with iPhones. Examples: NCC Prime Incell, ColorX Incell.
OLED Options: Vivid color, high contrast, responsive touch. Examples: NCC Soft OLED, NCC Hard OLED.
The reason why iPhones are difficult to repair is mainly due to various encryption systems. Sometimes, a programmer is needed for the repair. I will update some repair knowledge on DEV or my blog. I hope it can be helpful to you.]]></summary>

Chọn lớp nhân vật:
Chiến Binh (Warrior): Máu và phòng thủ cao với đòn tấn công cận chiến mạnh mẽ
Pháp Sư (Mage): Máu thấp hơn nhưng có khả năng phép thuật tàn phá
Đạo Tặc (Rogue): Chỉ số cân bằng với các đòn tấn công đặc biệt gây sát thương cao

Hệ Thống Chiến Đấu

Mỗi trận đấu bao gồm các lượt mà bạn và đối thủ AI thực hiện hành động:
Lựa Chọn Lượt Của Bạn:
Tấn Công (Attack): Tấn công cơ bản gây sát thương dựa trên sức tấn công của bạn


Phòng Thủ (Defend): Vào thế phòng thủ giảm sát thương nhận vào trong một lượt


Sử Dụng Kỹ Năng (Use Skill): Kích hoạt một trong những kỹ năng đặc biệt (nếu không trong thời gian hồi chiêu)


Mỗi lớp nhân vật có những kỹ năng độc đáo


Kỹ năng có thời gian hồi chiêu trước khi có thể sử dụng lại


Kỹ năng mạnh hơn các đòn tấn công cơ bản


Đối thủ AI sẽ thông minh lựa chọn giữa tấn công, phòng thủ hoặc sử dụng kỹ năng


AI thích nghi với phong cách chơi của bạn và trở nên thách thức hơn khi bạn tiến bộ


Đánh bại đối thủ sẽ tăng cấp độ khó



Tiến Trình Trò Chơi

Sau mỗi chiến thắng, bạn hồi phục một phần máu


Trò chơi theo dõi số lượng đối thủ bạn đã đánh bại


Độ khó tăng khi bạn đánh bại nhiều đối thủ:





Dễ (0-2 đối thủ đã đánh bại)


Bình thường (3-5 đối thủ đã đánh bại)


Khó (6-9 đối thủ đã đánh bại)


Ác mộng (10+ đối thủ đã đánh bại)
