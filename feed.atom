Last month, a coordinated network of accounts, utilising AI tools to amplify, fabricated stories claiming voter fraud in the Arizona gubernatorial election, pushing demonstrably false narratives to millions before fact-checkers could intervene. This wasn’t the work of human trolls; it was a sophisticated operation leveraging readily available large language models, a stark warning that the lines of reality online are blurring, and few realise the scale of the threat. The rise of increasingly sophisticated AI, coupled with the accessibility of generative models, is creating a new battleground for influence.

  Understanding MCP


The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants and LLMs to connect with external services and tools. Anthropic describes it as "a USB-C port for AI applications," providing a standardized way to connect AI models with various data sources and tools.
Until recently, MCP support was limited to Claude Desktop with local servers. This update changes the game …]]></summary>

OData (Open Data Protocol) is a standard that helps developers build and use RESTful APIs more easily. It provides a set of rules and guidelines for how APIs should handle things like requests, responses, filtering data, sorting, and more. With OData, you don’t have to worry about the technical details of how to structure your API—it takes care of things like HTTP methods, query options (like filtering and sorting), and data formats for you. It also includes advanced features like tracking changes, defining reusable functions, and handling batch requests. You would find connectors for OData in Power BI, MS-Excel etc., that makes it easier to consume the APIs from multiple clients. In short, OData makes it simpler to create APIs that are powerful, consistent, and easy to us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Lately, stablecoins are everywhere — this time around, headed by “traditional” financial institutions. Bank of America and Standard Chartered are considering launching their own stablecoin, joining JPMorgan, which launched its stablecoin, JPM Coin — rebranded as Kinexys Digital Payments — to facilitate transactions with their institutional clients on their blockchain platform, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). 
Mastercard plans to bring stablecoins to the mainstream, joining Bleap Finance, a crypto startup. The aim is to enable stablecoins to be spent directly onchain — without conversions or intermediaries — seamlessly integrating blockchain assets with Mastercard’s global payment rails.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. 
Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AG…]]></summary>

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting. 
Over the past 24 hours, short position liquidations exceeded $137 million, with Alphractal founder Joao Wedson observing that BTC's price momentum continues to favor bullish trends.

He added that projects with effective onchain incentive structures might even “build a better AI because you have this incentive engine that brings in developers,” Nailwal said on May 1.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino reiterated that Tether had no plans to apply for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDt — the largest by market capitalization — to be compliant under MiCA in European countries, potentially forcing exchanges to delist the stablecoin. He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.
In September 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued its first BitLicense to Circle Internet Financial, enabling the company to conduct digital currency business activity in the state. Ripple Markets received the second BitLicense in 2016. Circle and Ripple went on to become giant players in the global cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry.
Today, the NYDFS regulates one of the largest pools of crypto firms in the world, and it is often cited as the gold standard…]]></summary>

Bitcoin pressures shorts after 3% daily gains
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to a sustained bullish trajectory.
“Stocks trade at a key area here,” he wrote in ongoing X analysis.
“I think the general rule is that if stocks do trade back above the .618 Fibonacci retracement after a big drop, the botto…]]></summary>

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space.
