        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[⚡ What Is zeno-db?


zeno-db is a tiny but powerful library that handles client-side IndexedDB storage and syncs with a Postgres database on the backend — all in real time via WebSockets.
It's perfect for:
📝 Note-taking and journaling apps
📦 Inventory or POS systems
🧑‍🌾 Field apps in low-connectivity areas
🧠 Any local-first, collaborative app
✅ Offline-first: Use IndexedDB directly in the browser
🔁 Syncs to a remote PostgreSQL backend
⚡ Real-time updates using WebSockets
🧼 Zero dependencies
👷 Built with TypeScript
You get the speed of local storage with the reliability of Postgres, all wrapped in a lightweight sync layer.
Install with:
npm install zeno-db

Example usage:
import { ZenoClient } from 'zeno-db';

const db = new ZenoClient({
  serverUrl: 'wss://myapp.com/socket',
  database: 'my_local_db',
});

The client stores data locally, and when the network is available, it syncs everything seamlessly to your server.
🚧 It’s Beta — But Very Active


The project is in active development, and the authors are upfront: expect occasional breaking changes and limited docs (for now).
But if you’re an early adopter or building prototypes, it’s a fantastic time to explore.
🔄 How Does It Compare?



🧠 Final Thoughts


zeno-db is a promising, low-overhead alternative for anyone building a local-first experience on top of a familiar Postgres stack.
If you’re tired of choosing between complex sync engines or vendor lock-in, give this a shot.
👀 What’s Next?




🔗 NPM: zeno-db


🧪 Test it in your next PWA or internal tool

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How AI Chatbots Are Changing the Game (And Why Your Business Needs One)


Let's be real — in 2025, if you're not using an AI chatbot, you're already behind.
Chatbots aren’t just some techy trend anymore — they’re the secret weapon smart businesses are using to connect, sell, and support around the clock.
Think of an AI chatbot as a virtual assistant that’s always awake, always polite, and never asks for a coffee break. ☕
No scripts. No boring robotic replies. The best bots actually talk like humans now. Cool, right?
Here’s why you’re seeing chatbots everywhere:
Always Online: Your chatbot doesn’t need sleep — it’s available 24/7 for your customers.
Save Big Money: Instead of hiring huge support teams, a single bot can handle hundreds (even thousands) of conversations at once.
Instant Responses: No more customers waiting on hold or unanswered DMs.
Feels Personal: Today’s bots can remember past conversations and make users feel like they’re chatting with a real person.
And let’s be honest — when customers get instant help, they’re way more likely to stick around and buy.
📞 Customer Service: Help people out without lifting a finger.
🛒 Boost Sales: Recommend products and close more deals automatically.
📅 Appointments: Let customers book meetings without back-and-forth emails.
📈 Lead Generation: Find your next big client through a casual chatbot convo.
AI is moving fast — like, "blink and you'll miss it" fast.
Experts believe that within just a few years, bots will handle about 90% of customer conversations.
It’s simpler than you think:
Decide what you need — Sales? Support? Lead generation?
Pick a platform — There are tons of great ones like Dialogflow, ChatGPT, and Microsoft Bot Framework.
Plan your conversations — Make it fun, helpful, and easy to use.
Test and tweak — Your first version won’t be perfect. That’s okay!
✨ At Aerobyte Innovations, we build custom chatbots that actually sound human (because boring bots are bad for business).
Let’s chat!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Credited to: Charles Martinez
Recently, I had to look into a few ways to embed a chart into Rails mailer views. Most of the time, I just use chartkick because its simple and easy to use. But in mailers, Chartkick can’t be used directly, so you have to embed an image of the chart for it to work.
After a while, I bumped into QuickChart an Open Source library to generate chart images by just generating the url with the correct query parameters. And it offers a lot of chart options https://quickchart.io/gallery/
https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'bar',data:{labels:['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'], datasets:[{label:'Users',data:[50,60,70,180]},{label:'Revenue',data:[100,200,300,400]}]}}

And another thing, there’s also a gem that acts as a Ruby client for QuickChart -https://github.com/typpo/quickchart-ruby
u/chart = QuickChart.new(
  {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
      labels: ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'],
      datasets: [
        {
          label: 'Users',
          data: [50, 100, 120, 150]
        },
        {
          label: 'Revenue',
          data: [100, 200, 300, 450]
        },
      ]
    },
    options: {
      title: {
        display: true,
        text: 'Users vs Revenue',
        fontSize: 16,
        padding: 16,
      },
    },
  }
)

And then render the URL of that object in your Mailer View.
# apps/views/sample_mailer/sample_email.html.erb

<img src="<%= @chart.get_url %>">



And that’s it! You can now embed and render charts in your Mailer Views. Very simple and quick to implement.]]></summary>

If we talk from consumer POV, we will thing how our outbound request to the API pass the rate limit or how not to get caught by rate limiter. In low traffic application, it's not a problem, we wont hit the rate limit, but for mid - large scale traffic it might be an issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph, the integration enables users to trade over 1 million Solana-based tokens directly through the 1inch decentralized application (DApp), benefiting from maximal extractable value-protected swaps, optimized rates and open-source smart contract infrastructure.
The move brings 1inch’s Fusion protocol to Solana for the first time. Fusion enables users to define their ideal swap parameters, which are then executed by competing professional market makers, or “resolvers,” using Dutch auction mechanics.

Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

Dalio added that this is leading to irreversible damage, and an increasing number of importers and exporters, particularly between the US and China, are drastically reducing interdependencies and “making alternative plans.”

The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins, regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28.
The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them.
He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use …]]></summary>

The board will act as the “security council to protect the heart and soul” of the foundation and set visions for Ethereum, while the new management will be focused on the strategic and operational execution of those visions, the Foundation said in an April 28 blog post.
It added in an April 28 X post that Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were appointed as co-executive directors on March 2 to deliver on those visions — which are centered around championing censorship resistance, open-source innovation, privacy and security

Bitcoin gained 10% over the past week, but overhead resistance continues to obstruct a rally to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below.

Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst
The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.
Although the rally has been accompanied by $3.06 billion in spot ETF inflows, there are doubts whether that is enough to break Bitcoin out of consolidation.

The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum.
The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion, an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space.

According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt (USDT) continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies.
As of April 25, Tether has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC (USDC), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. 
Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. 
“With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said.

In a third reading on April 28 of Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay.
“This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025.

A week full of US macroeconomic reports could impact Bitcoin traders’ sentiment. 

Bitcoin’s rally could stall if there’s a sharp reduction in spot buy volumes.

If PCE, the ISM PMI, and jobs data align with market expectations, BTC could rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price could face a period of range-bound trading after managing a 10.37% rally over the past 7 days. Robust spot purchasing demand from Strategy, the spot BTC ETFs, and announcements from 21Shares and Coinbase played a role in Bitcoin’s rally to $95,700. With the exception of the April 28 announcement of a $1.42 billion BTC purchase from Strategy, a quiet week on the crypto news front could translate to a reduction in spot demand and lower support tests from Bitcoin price.
