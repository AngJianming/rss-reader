Many developers hit weird bugs due to scope and hoisting without realizing what's really going on. I just dropped a post that breaks down:
Why var, let, and const behave so differently


How JavaScript really handles function and block scopes


What hoisting actually does (and doesn’t)


How to write bug-free, predictable code

**A JavaScript engine is the core software component that executes JavaScript code, typically as part of
a web browser or runtime. Modern engines are highly optimized and use Just-In-Time (JIT)
compilation to improve performance . For example, Google’s V8 engine (written in C++) drives
Chrome and Node.js, while SpiderMonkey runs in Firefox, JavaScriptCore in Safari, Chakra in (legacy)
Edge, and Hermes in React Native. Each engine implements the ECMAScript standard (the formal spec

Understanding Kubernetes Setup


Kubernetes is not just a tool—it is a framework that provides a collection of utilities to deploy applications effectively. Unlike traditional cloud infrastructure tools, Kubernetes enables you to fully own and manage your remote machines with the following tasks:  
Creating clusters and nodes (Master & Worker nodes).

Setting up Kubernetes services like API Server, kubelet, and other components.

So, if you’ve ever looked at a messy spaghetti codebase and thought "This could use some structure", welcome.
Let’s untangle these patterns one by one, and see when and where each one fits.
Imagine your app is a play. MVC is the classic trio:
Model is the script.
View is the stage.
Controller is the director telling actors what to do when the audience reacts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[*Day 28: Create a Custom systemd Service and Timer on Red Hat Linux *
Today’s project focused on a powerful automation tool for Red Hat Linux admins: creating a custom systemd service + timer.
This lets you automate any script or task at system startup or on a schedule, without relying on traditional cron jobs.

This task is also a great match for RHCSA exam scenarios!
🔧 Objective
Write a simple shell script

Create a custom systemd service to run the script

Configure a systemd timer to run the service automatically

Verify the timer execution and check logs
📚 RHCSA Skills Covered
✔ Shell scripting basics

✔ Service creation and management with systemctl

✔ Timer creation with systemd

✔ Troubleshooting and log analysis with journalctl
1️⃣ Create a Custom Script
Create a script to log system uptime every 5 minutes.
Example script:
echo "$(date): System uptime is: $(uptime)" >> /var/log/uptime.log

Make it executable:
2️⃣ Create a Custom systemd Service
Example unit file:
[Unit]
[Service]
3️⃣ Create a systemd Timer
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/log-uptime.timer
Example timer file:
[Unit]
[Timer]
[Install]

4️⃣ Start and Enable the Timer
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Check status:

Verify logs:

Check systemd logs:

🧪 Try It Yourself
Change OnUnitActiveSec=5min to 1min and test faster execution
Replace the script with any custom automation (e.g., backup, cleanup)
Use systemctl status log-uptime.timer to verify next scheduled run
✅ Recap



Task
Tool/Command




Create shell script
nano /opt/scripts/log_uptime.sh


Create systemd service
/etc/systemd/system/log-uptime.service


Create systemd timer
/etc/systemd/system/log-uptime.timer


Enable and start timer
systemctl enable --now log-uptime.timer


Check logs

cat /var/log/uptime.log, journalctl




🎯 Why This Matters (RHCSA)
systemd skills are now explicitly tested on the RHCSA exam.
This project touches:
Unit creation
Timer configuration
Troubleshooting failed services
You’ll likely face a systemd troubleshooting or service creation task in the real exam.]]></summary>

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into th…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project’s CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 
He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That’s the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  
The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.

In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.
While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. 
At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. 
Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation an…]]></summary>

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
