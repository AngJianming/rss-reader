Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Session storage is a useful feature in JavaScript that allows developers to store data in a web browser for the duration of a page session. The question at hand is whether utilizing session storage to query user data from a database is a secure practice. The concern primarily revolves around the potential vulnerabilities that could arise when sensitive data is stored in session storage.
The benefit of using session storage is that it enables you to avoid repetitive database queries, thus optimizing the performance of your application. By caching the data in session storage after the initial retrieval, you can easily access user data without needing to make additional requests to the server, provided the session remains active…]]></summary>

In my case, it's not like I just graduated and came to work overseas — I’m a bit older, and besides worrying about my aging family and our household expenses, I also have to deal with a lot of complicated issues back home.
I really like Japan. Even though people say Tokyo is a cold and impersonal city if you actually live here, I think that suits someone introverted like me quite well. That’s why I set my sights on coming here a long time ago.
Right now, my main goal is still to successfully change jobs. But since I’ve been here longer now, and with the recent surge in living costs, I’ve started to worry more about everyday expenses. I’ve built up some savings over the years as an engineer, but looking ahead, I feel like I really need to find a way to improve my financial situation — and changing jobs seems like the only real option.
Life is still very hectic and fast-paced, but when I have more time, I’ll definitely share more details. To everyone out there working overseas — let’s keep pushing forward together!]]></summary>

Understanding State in Jetpack Compose
At the core of Jetpack Compose is a concept known as state. In your provided code, progress is defined as a mutable state using mutableStateOf(0f). This means that whenever progress is updated, Compose will automatically trigger a recomposition of any composables that are using this state.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Ecuador, public data systems are becoming increasingly accessible, and developers have a unique opportunity to create tools that make this data more user-friendly. One such system is the ANT matrícula, which allows individuals to check the legal status of a vehicle by entering its license plate.
This system is crucial for verifying vehicle registration, ensuring that taxes are paid, and checking whether there are any fines or restrictions on a vehicle. While the ANT does not provide a public API, developers can still create tools that simulate this functionality.
For instance, a backend system can be built using technologies like Node.js, where users can input a license plate number and receive data about its registration status. This not only helps users avoid scams when buying a used car but also assists businesses in managing vehicle fleets or ensuring compliance with national regulations.
However, it's important to follow ethical guidelines when accessing public data. Developers should ensure that personal data is never stored without consent and that scraping or data collection is done in compliance with legal standards.
Creating tools based on the ANT National Transit Authority matrícula system brings significant value to users, especially by saving them time and offering an easy way to confirm the legal status of a vehicle without having to visit government websites.
By building accessible and useful tools, developers can support transparency, safety, and efficiency in Ecuador's transportation system.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lido Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), the entity that governs the Lido liquid staking protocol, has initiated an emergency vote to rotate a compromised oracle — a bridge that connects real-world data to blockchain systems.
According to members of the Lido DAO, an address belonging to the Chorus One oracle was compromised, and the Ether (ETH) balance associated with that oracle was drained in an incident still being investigated.
Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

The attacker deployed the contract from address 0xb32a53... at 07:31:38 UTC and initiated the exploit at 07:33:56 UTC, draining funds from the victim wallet 0xb5252f...
Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…]]></summary>

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…]]></summary>

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong-based fintech firm RedotPay has reportedly launched its cryptocurrency-enabled payment cards in South Korea, positioning itself as a potential disruptor in a market dominated by traditional credit card firms and mobile payment services.
The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.
In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) capped off the trading week with another day of inflows, pulling in $356.2 million on May 9. The fund has now extended its inflow streak to 19 consecutive days — its longest run of inflows so far this year.
IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.
