Discover the Actor Model, a powerful paradigm for writing concurrent C++ that is simpler, safer, and more scalable. We'll build a "Ping-Pong" application from scratch using the qb framework to see how it works in practice.
Target Audience: Beginner / Intermediate C++ developers curious about modern concurrency.
For decades, concurrent C++ has been synonymous with std::thread, std::mutex, and std::condition_variable. While powerful, these tools force you to manually manage shared state, leading to a minefield of potential issues:
  Race Conditions: When multiple threads access shared data and at least one access is a write, leading to unpredictable results.

We'll demonstrate how to set it up, discuss upcoming features, and be available to answer all your questions.
Clerk Billing takes the same incredible DX we built for implementing authentication and applies it to recurring subscription logic to help you quickly monetize your products.
Configuring Subscriptions from the Clerk dashboard is simple:
Create your plans
Add the features associated with the plans
Enable Billing
You can add the new <PricingTable /> component to create a pricing page customized for your plans and your customers can manage their subscriptions directly through our profile components.
You can even gate features based on the plan/tier that a user is subscribed to using the has helper to confirm access before rendering the content. 
Clerk Billing easily syncs with new or existing Organizations, unlocking B2B subscription functionality.

JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit information between parties. It has three parts:
Header – Type and algorithm
Payload – User info (e.g. ID, email)
Signature – Verifies the token's authenticity
A sample token looks like:

But when things break in production, understanding how ClusterIP works internally is essential to resolving outages fast. This guide walks you through the ClusterIP traffic flow, and shares two real-world production issues, including how they were detected and fixed.

Plotting is one of those things you don't really care about until you need it. For that reason, working on plotting isn't exciting - but not having it can be really annoying.
The goal of the plotting API in Divooka is to provide a very high-level, easy-to-use (ideally single-node) setup for common plot types: you just supply the source data, pick the plot type, behold and voila - you get the resulting chart. In the case of the Plotting toolbox, the results are static images.

This scheme allows some fairly complex plot types, as seen here:

However, things can become tricky when we want to support advanced style configurations, for which the convention is to expose data on a node as direct inputs and style configurations as a separate Configurations input, as discussed in this b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past, when I opened Excel, it just looked like an empty grid — rows, columns, cells, and tables. It felt dry and technical, like a digital notebook without much purpose.
But once I began learning data analysis, I quickly realized Excel is far more than a basic spreadsheet tool. It's one of the most accessible and powerful platforms for working with data — especially when you're just starting out.
So, What Is Excel Really?
It’s part calculator, part notebook, part detective. And with just a few key skills, Excel becomes your go-to tool for understanding what your data is really saying.
💼 Real-World Uses of Excel in Data Analysis
HR Analytics: Understanding People Through Data
HR teams do more than just handle hiring paperwork. They use data to improve employee experiences and workplace performance.
Example:
Example:
Healthcare Data: Improving Efficiency
While Excel doesn’t replace hospital systems, it’s incredibly useful for managing non-sensitive healthcare data like appointments, staff schedules, or treatment plans.
Example:
🔍 Excel Features I’ve Come to Love
VLOOKUP: A lifesaver when combining datasets. I’ve used it to match product names with IDs or to connect survey results with demographic info.
Conditional Formatting: This makes patterns jump off the page — like highlighting overdue tasks, duplicate entries, or high scores.
IF Statements: Great for applying logic and flagging data — for example, labeling rows as “Pass” or “Fail” based on a score.
💭 How Excel Changed the Way I See Data
But now? I see data as a conversation.
When I open a dataset, I instinctively ask:
More importantly, Excel has made me more careful. I’ve learned to look twice before jumping to conclusions, and I’ve gained a deep appreciation for how a simple tool can surface powerful insights.]]></summary>
