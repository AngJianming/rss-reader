Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways
Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

But sometimes, the very things that seem perfect on the surface can silently rack up technical debt, or worse, financial cost.
Let’s talk about caching.
Sometime last year, I implemented a payment integration flow:
Generate a token
Authorize the request
Create a payment link
It was seamless. This setup successfully handled hundreds of thousands of deposits. No errors. No downtime. Everything looked rock solid.
Until about 6 months later.
Our payment gateway provider reached out:
"We’re seeing a spike in token generation. It’s burning through our resources."
My first reaction: Wait, what?
We followed the docs and generated a new token before every payment. Nothing seemed wrong. But here’s what we missed: each token had a 20-minute lifespan. Yet,…]]></summary>

About two months ago, I started volunteering for an NPO in a system admin role. The organization is quite pre-modern in how it operates—user inquiries were handled entirely via email. Sometimes our IT-related team handled the issues, and other times we had to forward them to the appropriate department. Of course, that meant forwarding the emails. I hadn’t seen dozens of endless “Re:Re:Re:” threads in a while. It felt like time-traveling back to the 2000s when I first entered the workforce.
Fortunately, the NPO uses Google Workspace for Nonprofits, so we have access to the basic Google apps. I decided to centralize user inquiries using a Google Form. However, form responses are aggregated into a spreadsheet by default, and managing each ca…]]></summary>

The developers were stunned. They had tested the code, but their familiarity with it had blinded them to the issue.
This scenario is all too common. When developers test their own code, they often miss bugs due to cognitive biases. It's like proofreading your own writing—you see what you expect to see, not what's actually there. Under tight deadlines, teams might:

According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” 
The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said.

One of the biggest winners is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take contro…]]></summary>

The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ether (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bancor, the creator of a smart contract-based automated market maker, is suing Uniswap for patent infringement, alleging the decentralized finance exchange has used its technology without permission and profited significantly from it.
According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).
