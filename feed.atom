Meet the modern magic of CSS:
animation-timeline: view();
With this property, you can create scroll-triggered animations without a single line of JavaScript. Smooth. Performant. Declarative.

  🧠 What Is animation-timeline: view();?


The animation-timeline property allows CSS animations to be driven by something other than time. When you use the special value view(), the animation is controlled by the element’s scroll position in the viewport.
That means your animation will start and progress based on how far the user has scrolled…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re using Cursor and keep seeing this error:
“Connection failed. If the problem persists, please check your internet connection or VPN”
You’re not alone. This issue tends to appear randomly—even when your internet is working just fine. It can interrupt your flow and make the experience frustratingly unstable.
Cursor uses the HTTP/2 protocol to power many of its AI features, since it allows streaming responses. However, not all networks handle HTTP/2 properly. If you're on a corporate network, using a VPN, or behind a proxy like Zscaler, HTTP/2 connections might fail.
As a result, Cursor may struggle to index your code or connect to its AI backend—leading to that annoying “Connection failed” message.
Thankfully, there’s a simple workaround. Cursor now includes a fallback to HTTP/1.1, which is slower but much more reliable on certain networks.
Here’s how to enable it:
Open Cursor Settings (Cmd or Ctrl + ,)
Go to VS Code Settings

Search for http2

Find and check the option “Disable HTTP/2”



This forces Cursor to use HTTP/1.1 instead, which should fix the connection issue and restore access to AI features.
✅ Once you do this, the error should stop showing up and things will run more smoothly.

        <link href="https://dev.to/linuxmaster/understanding-ssd-endurance-what-does-tbw-really-mean-5bpc"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using an SSD — and let’s be honest, you probably are — you might have come across a spec labeled TBW, or Terabytes Written. But what does it actually mean for the real-world lifespan of your drive?
Let’s break it down in simple terms.
TBW stands for Terabytes Written, and it’s a metric that tells you how much data can be written to an SSD before the drive is likely to start wearing out. Think of it like a fuel limit — not for how long the drive will exist, but for how much write work it can handle over its lifetime.
For example, if your SSD has a TBW of 600, that means you can write 600 terabytes of data to it before you start entering the "wear-out" zone, as defined by the manufacturer.
Let’s do a quick, real-world calculation.
Say you're a regular user writing about 100 GB per day — downloading files, installing apps, updating your system, working on projects. That’s quite a bit for a typical user, but let’s go with it.
100 GB/day = 36.5 TB/year

600 TBW / 36.5 TB/year ≈ 16 years



Yes, sixteen years of daily 100GB writing. That’s how much endurance a 600TBW SSD gives you. And if you write less than that (which most people do), it’ll last even longer.
You can monitor your SSD’s health and total data written using tools like:
CrystalDiskInfo (Windows)
smartctl from smartmontools (Linux/macOS)
These tools can show you how much data has been written so far, so you can get a real-time sense of your drive’s life expectancy.
TBW is an important but often misunderstood metric. SSDs don’t just suddenly die after hitting the limit, but the risk of data loss increases as the flash memory wears out. That said, for most users — even power users — modern SSDs offer years of reliable performance.
So the next time you see a TBW rating, don’t panic. Unless you're stress-testing your drive daily, you're probably fine for a decade or more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

The IPFS enhances privacy and security compared to traditional web protocols, such as HTTP, by identifying data based on its content rather than its location. This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight.
“The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”

"We know that miners will produce 165,000 BTC this year. Already, publicly traded companies have bought more than that. ETFs are at $6 billion in inflows. We think governments are going to be buying. We see this sort of structural difference between demand and supply."

"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote."

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. 
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.
In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…]]></summary>

Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. 
In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.

Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement, according to a filing on May 15.
Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the rejection does not reverse the company’s victory in the case. The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.

Alderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”

In a May 16 announcement, AsiaStrategy said it is partnering with Sora Ventures to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Sora previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan’s first corporate Bitcoin treasury.
The stock market took immediate notice of the announcement. Top Win stock closed the trading day at $7.50 on May 15, but traded at $12.12 in premarket at the time of writing — a jump of over 60%.

Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…]]></summary>

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.
