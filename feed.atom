        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a submission for the Runner H "AI Agent Prompting" Challenge
I built the Automated Opportunity Scout, an autonomous AI agent that acts as my personal business development analyst.
As a freelancer, my biggest non-billable time sink was prospecting. I used to spend over 10 hours a week manually searching for new clients, a repetitive process that yielded inconsistent results. The problem wasn't just finding data; it was connecting the dots to find real, actionable opportunities.
My Runner H workflow solves this problem entirely. Each morning, it autonomously scans the web for key business signals (like company funding announcements), identifies promising target companies, conducts deep-dive research to find the right decision-maker, analyzes their needs, and compiles a complete strat…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As full-stack developers, we waste countless hours debugging mismatched data types between frontend and backend. A 2024 survey by Postman reveals that 65% of API errors stem from type mismatches. Let’s fix this permanently with Express + tRPC – a combo that enforces type safety from database to UI.  
// Traditional Express - THE NIGHTMARE  
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {  
  const email = req.body.email; // Type: any 🤮  
  // 200 lines later...  
  res.json({ token: JWT }); // Hope frontend guesses the shape!  
});  

Result: Runtime errors, broken features, and angry Slack messages.  
Why This Wins




REST
GraphQL
tRPC + Express

✅ Codegen

As an independent contractor, time tracking is both necessary and absolutely important for getting paid. It also helps you stay organized and, by being in full control of the hours spent, it maintains trust from your clients. But often, time tracking feels like an unwanted chore.
In this blogpost, we will show you the smart and easy way to track your time using Nureti Timesheet.
This article specifically explains Nureti Timesheet in the context of an independent or self-employed solo person — whether your role is contractor, freelancer, or consultant. I mix and match the terms.

Build A Rocket Boy’s new single-player shooter Mindseye has landed with more hiccups than hi-res textures. Gamers on social media have been sharing everything from eldritch-style character stretches to laughable NPC antics, and PC performance is so unoptimised that environments literally pop into view. The Steam page sits at a tepid 42% “Mixed” rating, with users griping about bad Unreal Engine vibes, slow load-ins and choppy gameplay.
Silver linings and fixes incoming

Despite the tech woes, most agree Mindseye’s early story beats, sci-fi premise and solid gunplay/driving mechanics show real promise. The devs insist patches are on the way, so if you can stomach the current bugs, there might be a fun ride waiting once the hotfix train arrives.]]></summary>
