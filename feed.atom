        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: During early Baldur’s Gate 3 development, Larian Studios experimented with a cartoony, stylised “indie book” look—tearing the visuals down and restarting the art direction at least twice—before settling on the grounded, richly coloured style fans know today.  
Why it matters: Lead character artist Alena Dubrovina says those full turnarounds were brutal but ultimately paid off, giving BG3 a more realistic edge that likely helped its massive success. That said, the team’s animated shorts and indieish sketches are so charming that the author hopes one of Larian’s upcoming projects leans back into a fun, exaggerated cartoon vibe.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: After smashing it with the original Battlefront games, Pandemic Studios quietly kicked off Battlefront 3 right after Part II’s release…but LucasArts only gave them a one-year deadline. With a massive leap to PS3/Xbox 360 hardware and no idea what those new consoles could really do, Pandemic couldn’t hit the timeline and talks fell apart.
LucasArts then handed the project to Free Radical Design, who pushed their version to about 95% complete (complete with seamless space-to-ground battles), yet it too was canned. Pandemic folded in 2009, and aside from EA’s 2017 Battlefront II reboot, a bona fide Battlefront 3 still remains the stuff of fan dreams.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR

Games Workshop—best known for its Warhammer 40K miniatures—is riding a massive boom, reporting £560 million in core revenue (up from £494.7 million) and £50 million in licensing revenue (vs. £31 million) for the year ending June 1, 2025. Profits soared too, with pre-tax earnings of £255 million (up from £203 million), prompting the company to hand out a £20 million bonus pool—around £13,333 (≈ $18,000) per staffer across its ~1,500 employees.
Beyond tabletop sales, GW’s IP machine is humming: smash-hit games like Space Marine 2 (and Space Marine 3 in the pipeline), Amazon’s Secret Level animation, and a newly inked Henry Cavill–fronted Warhammer cinematic universe all helped lift licensing revenue to record highs. While they don’t expect this licensing surge to repeat next year, Warhammer’s never been bigger—and it doesn’t look like it’s slowing down anytime soon.]]></summary>

They offer a practical context for students to apply academic learning, understand workplace dynamics, and develop job-ready skills.
While major metros like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru continue to dominate the internship ecosystem, there is a rising momentum in Tier-2 cities.

According to a May 27 Standard Chartered research report shared with Cointelegraph, Solana “dominates in areas that demand high-volume, low-transaction-cost solutions” due to its design prioritizing fast and cheap transaction confirmation. The report suggested that this has had an unintended consequence:
“So far, this has been mostly in memecoin trading, which accounts for the majority of activity on Solana (as measured by ‘GDP’, which is application revenue).”
Standard Chartered said the memecoin frenzy served as a stress test for Solana’s scalability but came with drawbacks due to the volatility and speculative nature of such assets. As m…]]></summary>

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.
“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph that have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.

“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

The second man is a Swiss crypto investor who allegedly assisted business partner Joel Woeltz, who is accused of kidnapping Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan and torturing him in a Soho apartment in an attempt to pressure him into revealing his crypto wallet phrase, ABC7 New York reported on May 26.
A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader —  who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”
