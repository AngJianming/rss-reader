        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I’d change if I had to start my frontend journey over again.
Learning frontend development today is both exciting and overwhelming. There are countless tools, frameworks, and tutorials out there and it’s easy to get lost chasing everything.
I’ve been a frontend developer for 3 years now. I’ve built real projects, made real mistakes, and discovered what actually matters over time.
If I were starting from scratch today, here’s exactly what I’d do differently and what I’d focus on instead.
🎨 1. Learn UX While Learning Frontend
What I missed? User experience.
If you want to build good products, you need to understand:
How users interact with your UI
Spacing & hierarchy
🔧 2. Choose One Framework and Go Deep
Spoiler: I learned none of them well.
If I could go back, I’d pick one probably React (again) and go deep:
Build multiple real projects with it
⚙️ 3. Don’t Skip the Core Fundamentals
How the DOM works
Vanilla JavaScript
🤖 4. Use AI as a Learning Assistant (Not a Shortcut)
If I were a beginner today, I’d use ChatGPT or Copilot to:
Explain code I don’t understand
🧠 5. Focus More on Projects, Not Just Tutorials
If I were learning again, I’d spend less time watching tutorials and more time building things:
A personal portfolio
✅ Final Thoughts
If I were learning frontend development in 2025, I’d:
Learn UX alongside code
📣 What About You?
And if you’ve been coding for a while, what’s your biggest “I wish I knew that earlier” moment?

Design patterns in software development are like well-trodden paths in a dense forest—they guide us through complex problems using proven solutions. For experienced C# developers, mastering foundational patterns like Singleton or Factory is just the beginning. To truly elevate your craft, you need to dive into advanced design patterns that address more nuanced and sophisticated challenges.
In this blog post, we’ll explore three advanced design patterns: the Repository Pattern, Unit of Work, and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). You'll learn not just how to implement them in C#, but also why they matter and how they can improve the architecture of your applications.

  🧭 The Landscape Is Changing


In the growing chaos of “agent everything” hype, a much-needed paper dropped recently:
👉 AI Agents vs Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications, and Challenges by Sapkota et al. (MAY 2025)
This is not just another buzzword-salad. It’s the first serious attempt at defining what we actually mean by “agents” in the age of LLMs—and why most “agent frameworks” today are stuck in the wrong paradigm.
This post breaks it down, unpacks the key insights, and shows how they map directly to why I built OrKa: a cognitive orchestration framework designed for actual agentic reasoning, not just task scripting.

If you've ever built or deployed applications using Docker, you've likely hit a point where running containers on your laptop just isn’t enough. You need scaling, automation, recovery, and networking across machines. Enter Kubernetes, the container orchestrator trusted by startups and tech giants alike. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll walk you through what Kubernetes is, why it matters, and how Docker developers can start leveraging its power.
What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes (also called K8s) is an open-source platform that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. While Docker helps package your app into a container, Kubernetes helps run and scale it across many machines.

I never knew how my website links would look when I shared them online. Would the image show up on Twitter? Does it look good on Facebook? What about WhatsApp?
Instead of checking each site manually (which takes forever), I decided to build a tool to fix this problem. What started as a fun weekend project ultimately went viral on Hacker News.
MetaCheck is a simple web app that shows you how your website links will look on different platforms. Just paste in any URL and see how it appears on Google, Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and more - all at once.
The idea was simple: help people see their link previews without having to post test links everywhere.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔧 Amazon EKS and EKS Distro now support the latest Kubernetes 1.33 release!
The Kubernetes ecosystem just got a solid upgrade — and now Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro are ready for it.
AWS has announced general availability of Kubernetes version 1.33 for both:
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D)
Starting today, you can:
🚀 Create new EKS clusters with Kubernetes 1.33
🔄 Upgrade existing clusters using the EKS console, eksctl, or your favorite IaC tool
Kubernetes 1.33 packs a number of improvements focused on scalability, observability, and developer flexibility.
🧱 1. Stable Support for Sidecar Containers
Finally! Sidecars (e.g., for logging, security, or service mesh) are now officially stable. This unlocks better lifecycle management and more reliable injection patterns.
📡 2. Topology-Aware Routing and Distribution
Improved support for routing traffic based on node topology (region, zone, rack) — reducing latency and improving availability across zones.
🧮 3. Pod Topology Spread Constraints + Taints/Tolerations
Kubernetes can now consider taints and tolerations when calculating pod distribution. This means smarter scheduling decisions across your clusters.
🔐 4. User Namespaces for Linux Pods
This brings enhanced security and isolation by allowing pods to use different user ID mappings within the host system.
📶 5. Dynamic Resource Allocation for Network Interfaces
Pods can now request and be assigned network resources dynamically — great for high-performance workloads like eBPF or service meshes.
📈 6. In-Place Pod Resource Resizing
No more restarting pods to change CPU/memory limits! You can now scale vertically with minimal disruption.
You can upgrade your EKS clusters to 1.33 via:
EKS Console
eksctl
Terraform, CloudFormation, or CDK
Be sure to check compatibility with your workloads and custom controllers before upgrading.
Kubernetes 1.33 is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon EKS is supported.]]></summary>
