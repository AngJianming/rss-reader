        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hey all — i'm looking for an existing tool (or folks interested in building one) that can intelligently assist with filling out web forms. not just basic autofill, but something smarter — context-aware, user-aware, and unobtrusive.
here’s what i’m envisioning:
a browser extension that stays dormant until triggered (via right-click or keybind)
when activated, it should:
analyze the current form — field labels, structure, surrounding content
offer inline suggestions (ideally like copilot/intellisense) or autofill prompts i can tab through or accept
optionally suggest values for multiple fields at once when context allows
learn from my past entries, securely and privately (preferably local-first)
essential features:
gpt-4o or local llm integration for generating smart, field-appropriate responses
inline ui for previews/suggestions (not just “fill all”)
context menu or keyboard-triggered activation
encrypted local memory of my entries and preferences
multi-profile support (personal / work / educator etc.)
open source or built for extensibility
i’ve tried tools like harpa ai, compose ai, and magical — they get partway there, but none offer true inline, multi-field aware suggestions with user-defined control and memory.
if this exists, i want to use it.
thanks.]]></summary>

Hybrid mobile applications built with frameworks like Ionic (using Capacitor or Cordova) and React Native (using WebViews) combine web technologies with native app capabilities. While this approach offers many benefits, authentication—particularly cookie-based sessions—presents unique challenges that differ from both traditional web apps and fully native apps.
When your hybrid app runs:
iOS WKWebView: Uses a separate cookie storage from Safari
Android WebView: Behavior varies by OS version but generally isolates cookies
Capacitor's WebView: Implements a specialized cookie policy that differs from browsers

If you want to create PDFs or screenshots of sites the best solution is Puppeteer (https://pptr.dev/). The problem is that if you have Emojis or languages such CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) they are not included in the default layers provided.
The easiest way is to use package created by Sparticuz. It's small enough to fit in a Lambda Layer etc.
download chromium layer from here:
https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases


upload chromium layer to S3 bucket


create lambda layer from chromium layer in S3 bucket




  
  
  Fonts layer


Sparticuz/chromium does not include any fonts other than Open Sans. Will need fonts for emojis, and langs such as CJK.
I suggest using the font Noto by Google. You can see in my example directory I have NotoSansJP (for Japanese) NotoColorEmoji.

add font files to a fonts folder
run zip -9 --filesync --move --recurse-paths fonts.zip fonts/ in your CLI.
create lambda layer from fonts.zip




  
  
  Creating the Lambda




install puppeteer-core - the version will depend on your chromium version
https://pptr.dev/supported-browsers
npm i puppeteer-core@v24.0.0
Add the following to file:


import chromium from '@sparticuz/chromium'
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-core'

Attach both the Chromium and Fonts layers to your Lambda
Fonts will be automatically loaded from the /fonts directory in your attachd layer..]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I came across a bash script that checks the effectiveness of a Web Application Firewall (WAF). While it was useful, I wanted a bit more flexibility and the ability to add my own custom checks. I also wasn’t comfortable running a random bash script from the internet on my machine – even in a container. So, I decided to create this small web app, which allows not only me, but also you, to easily test how well your WAF is working.
WAF Checker is a simple, user-friendly service that lets you test your web application firewall against common attack payloads (like SQLi, XSS, Path Traversal, Command Injection, SSRF, NoSQLi, and LFI) using various HTTP methods. You just enter your target URL, select the HTTP methods you want to test, and get a clear, color-coded summary of the results. Just go and try https://waf.secmy.app/
If you’re interested in the latest techniques for bypassing WAF rules, I recommend checking out waf-bypass.com – it’s a great resource for staying up to date with new evasion methods and research.
Feel free to use this tool to test your own WAF and contribute ideas or improvements!]]></summary>

Forgot apple moved during the years we've got kids from x86 to ARM, thus couldn't use the standard VirtualBox images. When reading a bit on it I stumbled upon some horror stories on getting Kali up and running on apple silicon.... however for me the install went smoothly.

At first glance, they sound like some secret weapon only AI wizards know about. But once you understand what they are and why they matter, it all clicks.
Let me break it down in a way that feels less like a math textbook and more like a conversation over coffee.
Imagine you’re building a neural network. You pass in some inputs (like pixel values from an image), multiply them by some weights, add a bias, and boom — you get a number.
But then what?
That’s where activation functions come in. They act like gatekeepers or decision-makers for each neuron. Once your neuron computes a value, the activation function decides whether it should "fire" or not — and by how much.

So... I recently decided to dive deep into the world of DevOps, and I want to take you along for the ride. If you’re curious about DevOps or just starting out too, this post might resonate with you — or even better, we can learn together!
Right now, I'm still curating the best roadmap to follow and then start
I come from a background in Robotics Process Automation, using tools like  UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Power Platform. I’ve always been drawn to systems that make work more efficient, automated, and scalable.
Over time, I kept hearing the buzzwords: CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Cloud, and so on... It felt overwhelming. But I also knew that behind all the jargon was a philosophy that made tech teams faster, stronger, and more reliable.
What if I give DevOps a real shot?
💬 Let’s Connect!


Are you also starting with DevOps? Or are you further ahead and have some advice for me? Let’s chat in the comments — I’d love to hear your thoughts or book recommendations.
✍️ Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow my journey here if you’d like to keep up with my DevOps series. I’ll be posting weekly updates, lessons learned, and the occasional “oops, I broke something” story. 😅
Thanks for reading — here’s to learning something new, every day. ✨
