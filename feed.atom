        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being around for over two decades, WordPress remains one of the most dominant platforms for building websites — powering over 40% of all sites on the web.
And yet, in developer circles, it often gets unfairly dismissed as “just for bloggers” or “not technical enough.” The reality is far more nuanced.
**
**
A flexible CMS
Quick deployment
Scalability
Easy content management
A wide plugin ecosystem
WordPress checks all the boxes.
It’s not about using WordPress because it’s easier. It’s about using the right tool for the job.
Modern WordPress development isn’t just about installing themes and plugins. The top WordPress development companies use advanced techniques like:
Custom theme development (often using block-based editing)
Performance tuning for Core Web Vitals
Building scalable WooCommerce stores
API integrations for CRM, ERP, and other business tools
Security hardening and automated testing pipelines
If you're curious what that kind of high-level work looks like, here’s a curated list of some of the top WordPress development companies leading the charge in 2024.
If you're building a dev business or freelance practice, WordPress gives you:
Recurring revenue opportunities (via maintenance, hosting, SEO)
A low learning curve with room to scale into complexity
A massive client base that already understands the platform
And with tools like ACF, CPT UI, Elementor, and custom REST endpoints, you can build pretty much anything — from lightweight landing pages to full-scale web apps.
WordPress isn’t dead. It’s evolving.
The community has matured, the tech stack is more flexible than ever, and when used right, it’s incredibly powerful. So before writing it off, take a look at how the best in the industry are pushing it to the next level.
Check out this list of the top WordPress development companies to see how it’s done.]]></summary>

The foundation of this interaction is Model Context Protocol (MCP).
In this blog, I'll show you a simple working example of an MCP Client and MCP Server communicating locally using pure stdio — no networking needed!
The MCP Server acts as a toolbox:
- Exposes Python functions (add, multiply, etc.)
- Waits silently for requests to execute tools
 It executes the function and returns the result.
Example:
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("calculator")

@mcp.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

@mcp.tool()
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.  
“I can feel it in my bones, $2,000 ETH coming fast.”

As someone transitioning from the administrative assistance field into the world of technical writing, I knew I had a lot to learn. One of the biggest challenges I faced early on was understanding APIs—something completely new to me. But thanks to a LinkedIn discovery on one Elizabeth Bassey's post describing how she was able to conquer her fears about APIs and API Documentation. I also picked the encouragement to study more from a vibrant technical writing community called Technical Writing Mentorship Program, that I came across on LinkedIn, I found my way into the Postman Academy’s API Fundamentals Student Expert Certification. Here's how the journey unfolded.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Day at the Backend Embassy
Once upon a time in Webland, there was a grand building called the Backend Embassy. This building held all the secrets and data of a powerful kingdom — services, user data, currency prices — everything. But it wasn’t open to just anyone.
Out front, a friendly but strict API Secretary sat behind a reception desk. She managed all the requests, deciding who could go in and what they could ask for.
Now, our hero — a curious Frontend Developer — wanted to get some information. He didn’t want to go through a backend server of his own; instead, he sent a request straight from his Frontend App, running right out of his browser in the village of http://localhost:5173.
When the messenger arrived at the Backend Embassy, the CORS Guard stepped in.
“Hold on,” said the CORS Guard. “Where are you from?”
http://localhost:5173’?”
The secretary checked the papers and shook her head. “Nope. The API didn’t mention them.”
The frontend developer scratched his head. “So I can’t talk to the API directly from the browser unless they trust me?”
“Hey, can you go talk to the API Secretary on my behalf? The CORS Guard doesn’t block backend servers.”
The backend agreed. It passed through the gate easily, retrieved the data, and brought it back to the frontend.
The frontend now had what it needed — by going through a trusted backend proxy :))))))
Moral of the Story: CORS is a browser rule enforced by a security guard between frontend and backend. The browser checks if the API allows the origin. If not, the response is blocked — even if it's sent."]]></summary>

But as Maryrose Whittaker points out, integrating ASR into sensitive communication systems like PBXs raises significant data privacy concerns. While cloud-based ASR APIs offer convenience, they often mean sending potentially sensitive voice data—customer calls, internal strategy discussions, HR matters—to third-party servers.

Welcome back to Day 9 of our Linux journey! Over here, we are learning by doing every single day.
Today’s focus? Special permissions: They are powerful tools that give extra control over files and directories in multi-user systems.
Understanding how these permissions work can help you manage user behavior securely and professionally.

In Linux, we know basic file permissions (rwx). But special permissions go a level deeper. They include:
SUID (Set User ID)


SGID (Set Group ID)


Sticky Bit

Take a simple example: when I want to host an application I've built, I usually have two options:

You might ask yourself: why does this matter?
Browsers are moving away from the legacy unload event because it breaks the back/forward cache (bfcache), an in-memory snapshot that makes “back”/“forward” navigations nearly instant. Any page with an unload listener is ineligible for bfcache, slowing down users when they navigate away and then return13.

Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin (BTC) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. 
Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Tra…]]></summary>

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The concept of a Russian ruble stablecoin received special attention at a major local crypto event, the Blockchain Forum in Moscow, with key industry executives reflecting on some of the core features a ruble-backed stablecoin might require.
Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

Bitcoin gained 10% over the past week, but overhead resistance continues to obstruct a rally to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
