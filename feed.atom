  1. History of JavaScript Interpretation and Performance Challenges


JavaScript, launched in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape, was designed to bring interactivity to web pages, such as form validation or simple animations. As an interpreted language, it executed code line-by-line without pre-compilation, which suited the basic web applications of the 1990s. Back then, web pages were static, and JavaScript’s role was limited to client-side scripting in browsers like Netscape Navigator.
By the 2000s, web applications grew complex, incorporating real-time features and rich interfaces. JavaScript also expanded beyond browsers to server-side platforms (Node.js), mobile apps (React Native), and desktop apps (Electron). Thi…]]></summary>

If you're an old fart like me, you'll probably remember a line from a Chris de Burgh song released in 1982:  "Ship to shore, answer my call, Send me a signal, a beacon to bring me home."
What does this have to do with game development?  Well, the first thing I code in any game I make is a form of the Observer pattern.  It allows you to send signals to trigger events in different parts of your game engine without actually calling the code directly. 
NOTE: This technique is only useful in fire-and-forget type situations.  If you need a response from your call, you shouldn't use this method.  Don't get trapped in the situation where yo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🌟 What is Abstraction in Java?
Abstraction is a concept where you hide the internal details of how something works and only show the essential features.
In Java, abstraction is implemented using:
Abstract classes
Interfaces
💡 Why Do We Use Abstraction?
Here’s why abstraction is useful and often necessary in Java:
1. Reduces Complexity
Abstraction helps you focus on what an object does, not how it does it. This makes code easier to understand and use.
2. Improves Maintainability
Since the internal implementation is hidden, changes to it don’t affect other parts of your program.
3. Supports Reusability and Scalability
Abstract classes and interfaces define reusable templates. You can create different implementations without changing the rest of the system.
4. Enables Loose Coupling
You can program to an interface or abstract class, which reduces dependency on specific implementations.
🕒 When Should You Use Abstraction?
Use abstraction in the following situations:
If several classes have similar methods but differ in implementation, use an abstract class or interface to define the shared behavior.
Example:
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}

Now different shapes like Circle, Rectangle, or Triangle can inherit from Shape and define their own draw() method.
✅ When building frameworks or libraries (tbd)
If you're designing a framework or API, abstraction lets you define contracts that other developers can implement without exposing internal logic.
Example:
interface Database {
    void connect();
    void disconnect();
}

Different databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB can implement this interface in their own way.
Use abstract classes when you want to provide some common code and restrict object creation.
Example:

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();
}


You can’t create an Animal object directly, but subclasses like Dog or Cat can extend it and implement sound().]]></summary>

After installing and setting up Amazon Q, I only asked for help in creating a simple expense tracker using React, utilizing a list object to ensure no API is involved in data manipulation.

I was surprised when Amazon Q Developer asked, 'Allow this action?'—curious about what would happen next.

After I allowed the action, I was honestly surprised—it didn’t just show me some code, it actually created real files in my project.

For finalization, since the code and files were already generated, all I did was refine some parts of the code provided by Amazon Q. I created a React project using Vite, integrated the recommended code, and ran it. That’s it—it was surprisingly easy to build with Amazon Q Developer.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Before working with Red Hat Linux commands, you need a practice environment where you can experiment safely. Whether using a local Linux terminal, a virtual machine, or a dedicated system, setting up an environment ensures you can explore Linux without affecting your main system.  
If you already have Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) installed, the terminal is your main tool for executing commands.  
To open the terminal:  
Press Ctrl + Alt + T or search for Terminal in the applications menu.

Start typing commands directly to interact with the system.



If you don’t have RHEL installed yet, you can download the ISO file and install it on your system.  
👉 Download Red Hat Enterprise Linux: Red Hat Download Page  
If you prefer running Red Hat Linux without installing it on your main computer, using a virtual machine (VM) is a great option.  
Install Virtualization Software  
VMware Workstation Player: Download Here


Oracle VirtualBox: Download Here








Download Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) ISO  
Register for a free Red Hat Developer Account:


Visit the Red Hat Developer Program.

Create an account (free for individual developers).






Sign in and access the RHEL Download Page:



Download RHEL ISO






Choose the latest version and save the ISO file.








Set Up the Virtual Machine  
Open VMware Workstation Player or Oracle VirtualBox.

Create a new virtual machine, selecting the RHEL ISO as the installation media.

Follow the setup instructions to install RHEL in a virtual environment.








Once the VM is up and running, you can start practicing Red Hat Linux commands without modifying your main system.  
Setting up a Red Hat Linux practice environment ensures safe learning and experimentation. Whether using the built-in terminal, a virtual machine, or a dedicated system, having a proper setup makes mastering Linux commands easier.

I got these Antela smart bulbs a while ago. They connect to my home network, and I control them from my phone via either the Tuya Smart app (Tuya is a Chinese IoT service provider) or Google Home. I got the smart bulbs rather than smart switches because they allow me to customize the brightness and colour, a feature I found helpful when my eyes were super sensitive to light after surgery.
I also recently began to use Home Assistant. Think of it as an open-source and more powerful alternative to Google Home/Amazon Alexa/Apple HomeKit/Samsung SmartThings. With those vendor platforms, you're limited to what they support. With Home Assistant, you can build your own setups and connect things as you wish, whether it's totally DIY or consumer-ready products from vendors.

Quando penso em "jogo" no sentido mais puro e essencial, fora do digital, penso em um conjunto claro de regras que definem vencedores e perdedores, como no futebol, vôlei, golfe ou pôquer. O primeiro sucesso digital foi Pong (1972), lançado em 1972 pela Atari: basicamente um "tênis de mesa" virtual, dois jogadores controlam raquetes verticais e devem rebater uma bola em linha reta; deixar passar é ponto para o oponente. Depois vieram níveis, fases, mais desafio e ação com Space Invaders (1978), puzzles com Tetris (1984) …]]></summary>

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.
In a race where rivals are slashing transaction times and polishing user experiences, standing still isn’t an option. To hold its ground at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 as a whole, Ethereum must keep sharpening both its exe…]]></summary>

The lack of interoperability across blockchains means users need to create multiple wallets to interact with different networks, with users having at least two wallets rising by 16% over the past year. 
According to a research report published by onchain user experience platform Reown and crypto intelligence firm Nansen, 62% of crypto users reported using at least two wallets over the past three months, up from 45% in 2024.
More than 18% of respondents said security was their top concern related to wallet use, while 10.6% cited poor user expe…]]></summary>

The report, published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures.
Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters.

World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

The former Binance executive joined a fireside panel with macroeconomic analyst Raoul Pal to discuss the rationale behind his 2022 investment in X and artificial intelligence. Zhao said:
“I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don't have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.”

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>
