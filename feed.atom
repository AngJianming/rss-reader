In Part 1 - "Parallel Processing with PHP: why, how, and when", we learned how to use pcntl_fork() in PHP to create parallel processes.
In PHP, once a child process finishes its task (or even during the task), it often needs to send information back to the parent process.
This second part will explain how to build a communication channel between parent and child processes.
Without a dedicated communication channel, a parent process can only rely on the child’s exit status code, which is limited to a simple numeric value (0–255). This tells the parent if the child finished successfully or if a signal terminated it, but not what the child did or why something failed.
That means the parent is left guessing:
Did the child…]]></summary>

As software developers, we often think our job is to develop software, but, really, that is just the means to an end, and the end is to empower business to reach their goals. Your code may be elegant, but if it doesn’t meet the objectives (be they time or business) it doesn’t f***ing work.
From a business point of view, what makes a good developer (in fact, any employee, from the most hands-on roles to leadership) is how they influence the entire system — in our case, the business itself.
A useful way to judge a solution’s quality is to ask whether it is a global or local optimisation. Local optimisation improves something on a narrow scale, while global optimisation benefits the whole.

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security. 
This hack differs from earlier eras because it happened to a major global exchange that takes securit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

DefiLlama states that major liquid restaking protocols now hold over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), with dozens of middleware services aligning their security with Ethereum’s economic base layer. What started as an idea to increase capital efficiency for validators has evolved into a serious attempt to redefine how security is provisioned across decentralized systems.
While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.
In a race where rivals are slashing transaction times and polishing user experiences, standing still isn’t an option. To hold its ground at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 as a whole, Ethereum must keep sharpening both its exe…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fragmentation and complicated user experience remain two of the most significant obstacles to cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption, according to a new industry report. Most users now use at least two wallets to manage their cryptocurrency investments.
The lack of interoperability across blockchains means users need to create multiple wallets to interact with different networks, with users having at least two wallets rising by 16% over the past year. 
According to a research report published by onchain user experience platform Reown and crypto intelligence firm Nansen, 62% of crypto users reported using at least two wallets over the past three months, up from 45% in 2024.
More than 18% of respondents said security was their top concern related to wallet use, while 10.6% cited poor user expe…]]></summary>

The report, published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures.
Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters.
“This is absolutely false,” she said. “The CEO of Tesla…]]></summary>

Strategy’s stock rose 32% in April, its biggest monthly gain since November.

Speculation is building that Strategy will announce a major capital raise during its Q1 earnings call on May 1 as it continues to grow its Bitcoin holdings.

Analysts expect a 1% year-on-year revenue bump to $116.6 million, following the firm’s $120.7 million revenues for Q4 2024.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy closed April with its highest monthly gain since November, ahead of the firm’s highly anticipated earnings call on May 1.
Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, closed April 30 trading at $380.11, a 32% increase from its closing price of $288 on March 31, according to Google Finance data.

The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement.
World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. 
The firm had previously skirted launching in the US due to regulatory concerns over offering a token, fears now seemingly allayed with the crypto-friendly Trump administration.
