🔍 Why Real-Time Knowledge Graphs?
Extract semantic relationships using an LLM
Stream structured graph data into Kuzu
Build a real-time, self-updating knowledge base
✅ CocoIndex
https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex
✅ Kuzu
https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu

✅ Large Language Models (LLMs)
We understand preparing data is highly use-case based and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. 
We take the composition approach, and instead of building everything, we provide native plugins to embrace the ecosystem and make it easier to plug in and swap any module by standardizing the interface - exactly like LEGO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers track changes in their code. Sometimes, you may commit changes accidentally or realize that you need to undo them. That's where git reset comes in.
The git reset command allows you to undo commits at different levels:
--soft - Keeps changes in the staging area.


--mixed (default) - Unstages changes but keeps them in the working directory.


--hard - Discards all changes completely.



In this guide, we'll explore each option with examples, use cases, and tips to help you undo commits effectively.
git reset --soft - Keep Changes Staged


This option moves the HEAD pointer to a previous commit but keeps all changes in the staging area(index).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose


In a world where software must evolve or perish, we embrace a principle often overlooked:
The value of things that are designed to disappear.
Ephemeral Design is a mindset that encourages developers to build systems with impermanence in mind—favoring modularity, replaceability, and minimal long-term baggage.
Favor deletion over preservation.


Design with a clear exit strategy.


Ephemeral Design Manifesto


Be honest about what might disappear.


Optimize for change, not permanence.




  
  
  Practice Hints




Modularize everything: small parts are easier to remove or replace.
Isolate experimental features from the core domain logic.
Document the lifespan of components, especially if temporary.
Avoid over-engineering for uncertain features.
Use structure or conventions to indicate ephemerality (e.g., separate directories, metadata, flags)—but balance clarity with elegance.
Adopting Ephemeral Design doesn’t mean building carelessly.
intentionally, with the courage to discard what no longer serves.
Teams that embrace this mindset:
Move faster by reducing fear of technical debt
Feel safer experimenting and iterating
Write more honest, sustainable software
Everything is temporary—especially in code.
By designing with this in mind, we create systems that are not just flexible, but free.]]></summary>

That was me — during my college days, opening the AWS Console for the very first time.

It felt like IRCTC with jet engines: options everywhere, nothing made sense.

So, I did what most students do — I closed it. 😅
But here’s the secret: AWS isn’t scary if you learn it like an Indian story — with chai, analogies, and use cases that click.
AWS in Desi Terms


Think of AWS as the Tata Group of Technology.
They already own: 🏭 Data centers · 🔌 Networks · 🧠 AI models · 🛡️ Security tools

You just pay for what you use, like Ola rides or Paytm Fastag.

Spoiler alert: I didn’t win. But the project that did was seriously impressive a Satellite Signal Log Analyzer that parsed satellite radio logs in real time, with interference risk scores, visual trend charts, log comparisons, and more, all powered by Llama 4 and a sleek orange/white UI.

Let me introduce a superpower duo:
HTMX + AI → a match made for developers who want speed, personalization, and interactivity without the overhead.
And guess what? It works beautifully without needing a massive front-end framework like React or Vue.

HTMX lets you:
Use standard HTML attributes to make AJAX requests, load dynamic content, and update the DOM.
Keep your backend in control (Django, Flask, Rails… you name it).
Avoid the complexity of JS-heavy frontends.
