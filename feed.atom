        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[تا حالا به این موضوع فکر کردید که چطور میشه داده ها رو به راحتی و سریع مرتب کرد؟ الگوریتم InsertionSort یکی از روش های جالب و ساده برای این کار هست. این الگوریتم به شما کمک می کنه که با درک بهتری از چگونگی مرتب سازی، مهارت های برنامه نویسی خودتون رو تقویت کنید.
همونطور که می بینید، Insertion Sort در بهترین حالتش عملکرد خوبی داره و برای مجموعه های کوچک داده ها مناسب به نظر می رسه. در ادامه، بیشتر به مزایا و معایب Insertion Sort نسبت به سایر الگوریتم ها خواهیم پرداخت تا بتونید انتخاب بهتری داشته باشید.
 حالت بهترین: وقتی که آرایه تقریباً مرتب شده، Insertion Sort عملکرد خیلی خوبی داره. در این شرایط، الگوریتم فقط به یک یا دو مقایسه برای هر عنصر نیاز داره و پیچیدگی زمانی اش به O(n) می رسه. مثلاً فرض کنید آرایه ای مثل [1، 2، 3، 4، 5] داریم؛ Insertion Sort به راحتی هر عنصر رو در جای خودش پیدا می …]]></summary>

This has left me with some down time each day while she's doing her thing.  So I've had some extra time to work on a fun new project, and today I'd like to share that with you.
The project is called Fathom's Edge, and it's a retro-style RPG.

Fathom's Edge


This game draws inspiration from several sources:
classic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like Nethack


EAMON, an RPG game system back in the Apple ][ days
Oblivion Remastered, which I've also been playing a bit this week
Each of these have some fun elements I'd like to bring to Fathom's Edge, but EAMON is the one that really sets it apart.  EAMON was a unique system where you could take one character through multiple adven…]]></summary>

🎨 "Dad, how do I make my website PRETTY?"
Now that your child has mastered HTML basics (from  Part 1), it's time for  CSS—the magic that turns black-and-white websites into colorful, exciting creations! This guide makes CSS fun and visual for young learners.
Why Teach CSS to Kids?




Instant Visual Rewards  - Change colors and see immediate results


Boosts Creativity  - Lets them personalize their projects


Teaches Design Thinking  - Introduces spacing, alignment, and style




  
  
  CSS Crash Course (Ages 8-14)



  
  
  1. The 3 Ways to Add CSS





<!-- Method 1: Inline (quickest for kids) -->
<h1 style="color: blue;">Hello!</h1>

<!-- Method 2: Internal (in <head>) -->
<style>
  body { background-color: lightgreen; }
</style>

<!-- Method 3: External (advanced) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

2. Kid-Friendly CSS Properties


🎨 Colors & Text
h1 {
  color: purple;           /* Name */
  color: #ff00ff;          /* Hex code */
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS";
  text-align: center;
}

📦 Box Model (Explain like LEGO bricks)
img {
  border: 3px solid red;   /* Outer line */
  padding: 10px;           /* Inside space */
  margin: 20px;            /* Outside space */
  width: 200px;
}

3. Fun Projects to Try


Project 1: Rainbow Text
<h1 style="
  background: linear-gradient(to right, 
  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple);
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
  color: transparent;
">RAINBOW!</h1>

Project 2: Animated Button
button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  transition: all 0.3s;
}
button:hover {
  background-color: red;
  transform: scale(1.1);
}

Understanding the Error
The error message 'attempt to index a nil value' typically occurs when you try to access a property of a table (or in this case, an array) that hasn’t been created or initialized properly. In your case, it seems that the elements of the objects.asteroids table are being declared in the for-loop, but the structure might not be preserved as you expect.

According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.

When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…]]></summary>

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
