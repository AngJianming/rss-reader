This article examines their historical contexts, operational advantages, implementation challenges, and optimal use cases, providing actionable insights for organizations navigating modern data management.  
Developed in the 1990s, ETL emerged as a response to technological constraints, including expensive storage and limited computational resources. Its sequential process—extracting data from heterogeneous sources, transforming it into standardized formats, and loading it into centralized repositories—prioritized storage efficiency by discarding raw data post-transformation.

Tony Robbins (and probably your future self after debugging for 3 hours)
Once upon a time in a land not far away — just behind your browser tabs and that one folder called tempStuffForLater — lived a tired developer named Elliot.
Elliot was brave, skilled, and a master of JavaScript sorcery, but he had one fatal flaw:
He feared writing docs.
In his kingdom, documentation was handled through monstrous WYSIWYG editors. They promised magic — bold with a click! headings with a shortcut! — but Elliot knew the truth. They:

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
Examples (Input -> Output):
"String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
"Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
"1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
Thoughts:



I transform the string to an array and split it into individual letters.
I use the map() method to replace each letter to a double letter and join the array to a string.
Solution:





function doubleChar(str) {
 const array = str
    .split("")
    .map((arr) => arr.replace(arr, arr + arr))
    .join("");
  return array;
}

  Abstract


In modern DevOps environments, integrating security directly into CI/CD pipelines is no longer optional. This paper explores methods to incorporate anti-malware scanning into development pipelines using ClamAV, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne, focusing on container images, software dependencies, and runtime behavior. It provides actionable guidance for security automation in build and deploy processes.
Traditional malware threats are now targeting build environments, open-source libraries, and container registries.
The concept of identifying security issues early in the development lifecycle, not post-deployment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Otherwise known as lifelong learning, I love to experience the sort of rebirth of starting from scratch. I've been programming for 8 years at this point and have built complex high-level systems in the context of web applications, mainly based on product requirements at a job.
But most of the time, I still feel like I'm putting lego pieces together. I've had a yearning to start from scratch for a long time, even if that means being uncomfortable and banging my head against a wall until I become minimally competent.
In addition, the rise of AI as a dual-use technology is making it so we can build faster, but also build "dumber," with a general disconnect toward the tools that we need to be self-sufficient. I think that we should be using AI, but I also think that this challenges us to make ourselves better so we are not churning out mediocre slop code.
For years, I have been trying to learn systems programming. I've done previous dives into Go, Java, and now I'm on C. I can't say I've ever got the systems learning to "stick," but this time I feel closer than ever.
Starting with Beej's Guide and now building alongside a tutorial for making my own text editor (replacing variable names and some syntax choices for readability), I am really excited about where this journey will take me.
So what is the goal of all of this? At the end of the day, it's going to make me a better programmer. Learning DSA from the ground up is also going to make me a better programmer (highly recommend The Primagen's Course for this one). I don't have a computer science background, and I'm not going to pretend I know everything because I have been building things on a practical basis for so long.
It's good to be a beginner. The world is open again.]]></summary>

Every enterprise or every project needs to have a codebase. Without it, It's chaos. Developers working on project will have a hard time picking up on updates. As each of them will have their own copy. If local computer is somehow crashed, The entire data is deleted. So many problems. In our case, We have our own on-prem GitLab Server.

While using Cursor, I was aware of Copilot and its features, but at the time, it felt unstable and not as polished as Cursor. Recently, I noticed that GitHub Copilot has been improving significantly, becoming a strong competitor to Cursor. This encouraged me to give Copilot a try, especially since it offers a larger quota for expensive LLM calls and has proven to be stable even in its preview version.
Another reason for the switch was my existing GitHub Pro subscription, which meant I could save $22 per month by not needing Cursor’s subscription if Copilot proved to be a good alternative.
