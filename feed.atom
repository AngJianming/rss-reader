This topic is critical for developers who want to manage their initialization logic effectively while leveraging Rust's ownership and concurrency features. In this article, we will explore the inner workings of OnceLock, how it initializes values, and whether it allows resetting to handle errors.
Understanding OnceLock


The OnceLock type is part of the Rust standard library, found in the std::sync module. It provides a way to initialize a value once and ensures that the initialization is thread-safe. This makes it ideal for scenarios where a resource should only be created the first time it is needed, but once initialized, it cannot …]]></summary>

As infrastructure has evolved from monoliths to microservices spread across multiple clouds, our approach to monitoring and maintaining these systems needs to evolve too.
Enter AI in IT monitoring - a fundamental shift in how we detect, diagnose, and resolve issues. Let's dive into why traditional approaches are falling short and how AIOps is changing the game.
Modern infrastructure has pushed traditional monitoring approaches beyond their breaking point. Here's why:
Traditional Monitoring Approach:
1. Set static thresholds for metrics
2. Generate alert when threshold crossed
3. Human investigates alert

I get that some people are worried AI will take their jobs. Honestly, I don’t think that’s the right question. It’s less about “Will AI replace me?” and more about “How can I use AI to level up and stay ahead?”
Here are five ways I’ve seen AI help software engineers do just that.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bhutan, known for investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, has launched a tourism crypto payment system in partnership with Binance Pay and DK Bank.
The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department, said.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. 
With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states. 
“This will allow World Liberty Financial to validate the technical functionality of its airdrop system in a live environmen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.
The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit…]]></summary>

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. 
The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.
