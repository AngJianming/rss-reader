Since failing that interview I have been working on an AI system design interviewer which let's me practice discussing trade offs while diagraming and reacting to any questions the interviewer has for me! 

Through that I have been doing lots of practice interviews and these are my top tips i have learnt for those preparing for any interview:
1 - Practice! Just as you practice leet code questions you need to practice discussing trade-offs and explaining how components in your system combine to solve a problem. 
2 - Have a couple trade off points ready to discuss. A lot fo system design follows a similar pattern, so be able to easily reel off why you prefer once caching strategy to another in a certain scenario will help give your interviewer points to write down in your favour. 
3 - Brush up on your database design. This is an area many interviewers will want to deep dive on and area where there is plenty to discuss and show off your knowledge. Looking into SQL vs NoSQL, CAP Theorem, and ACID are reasonable places to brush up. 
4 - Be aware of time. In this high pressure situation time can creep up on you. You can find yourself thinking you have plenty of time left to discuss all the great points you have in mind and then your interviewer says "and that's time!“
Overall System design interviews offer a chance to showcase our knowledge of how complex systems are built, how we understand the effects of our design choices, and how well we can communicate the trade offs that come with those decisions. Make sure you are prepared to deliver your best self!]]></summary>

Let’s break down the 8 Route 53 routing policies, explain how they work, and when to use each—with real-world examples.
1️⃣ Simple Routing
🧠 What It Does:
Basic one-to-one routing to a single resource (like an EC2 instance, load balancer, or S3 website).
📦 Use Case:
    Static website hosted in S3
    Single-region application
🔧 Example:
example.com → 192.0.2.1

2️⃣ Weighted Routing
🧠 What It Does:
Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on assigned weights.
📦 Use Case:
    Canary deployments or gradual traffic shifting
    Load testing a new version of your app
🔧 Example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Big Decision
FPGA: Fast, Flexible, and Friendly (At First)
Design experimentation
Low-volume production
Rapid updates
FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) are the go-to for flexibility. You can change the logic even after deployment, which makes them perfect for testing, tweaking, and pivoting. You don’t need to lock in your design—and that’s the big win early on.
ASIC: Locked, Loaded, and Ready to Scale
Power-sensitive applications
Long-term deployment
When performance matters most
ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are custom-built for one purpose. Once designed, they’re not reprogrammable—but that’s part of the appeal. You get better performance, lower power usage, and tighter control over your product’s footprint.
So, When Do You Make the Leap?
Don’t Rush the Leap
Why Verification Matters More Than Ever
What If You’re Not Sure?
Wrapping Up
ASIC Design, Verification and Validation isn’t a phase—it’s the path to getting it right.
FAQs
Can I use the same design files from FPGA for an ASIC?
You can often reuse parts of the RTL code, but you’ll need to optimize it specifically for ASIC. This usually involves working closely with ASIC Design, Verification and Validation teams to clean up, adapt, and test thoroughly.
How long does ASIC development take compared to FPGA?
FPGA design cycles are shorter because you can program and reprogram them instantly. ASIC timelines are longer and require rigorous ASIC Design, Verification and Validation to minimize risks and avoid costly re-spins.
Is it possible to go back to FPGA after moving to ASIC?
Technically yes, but it’s not practical or cost-effective in most cases. Once you move to ASIC and invest in physical fabrication, the better question becomes: how can we get the most out of ASIC Design, Verification and Validation to make the chip as robust as possible?]]></summary>

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

Bitcoin dominance hits 65% for the first time in over four years, but analysis thinks its days are numbered.

The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days. 
Coinbase managing director for APAC John O’Loghlen said on May 5 the reelected Albanese Government has the “opportunity and the responsibility to move quickly on this issue” and called for a Crypto-Asset Taskforce to be established within its first 100 days “with the aim of bri…]]></summary>

The US-based Bitcoin (BTC) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.

The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery.

The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post.
The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.
During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the pos…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met.

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico.
Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.
Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.
