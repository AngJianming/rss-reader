        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share a very quick on something I learned that was pretty useful to me, so thought it might be useful to others. Here is a scenario that some of you might be familiar with:
You have a successful Amazon Q Developer session, and then maybe a few days later, you are trying to recall exactly what you did and how you put your prompts together - what can you do?
As it turns out, a recent update to Amazon Q Developer was a big help. In the Amazon Q Developer chat interface, there is a new icon next to the different tabs (its an icon of a click, which when you hover over says "View Chat History") which when you click on this, it will bring back a list of previous chats that have been recorded. What does this mean? 
In the "~/.aws/amazonq/" directory there is a "history" directory, and looking at it, it contains a number of time/date stamped json files.
├── history
│   ├── chat-history-0f97086b54fd7d6128dfd80426dfd63d.json
│   ├── chat-history-10d817f64fc99f04badf1568a6c23814.json
│   ├── chat-history-deba93a681a17ae26ff2b977acf0ba97.json
│   ├── chat-history-fa5091a7425e7938fe770a584b63076e.json
│   └── chat-history-no-workspace.json


These are what the Amazon Q Developer VSCode plugin now produces as you start using it. 
That said, because I had deleted my project, and so I was unable to get this from VSCode itself. Aarrgh, I thought to myself. Not to worry though. I still had the files in the history directory. So reviewing these with my favourite json viewer (I knew  which file to use, aligning date stamps from these and the code files in my project workspace), allowed me to extract all the history, including prompts and responses. Very handy to know if you want to go back in time.

This saved me, so hoping it will help others who are looking to recover what they did.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started writing code, I thought the goal was perfection.
A flawless feature. A zero-bug release. The cleanest, DRYest, most elegant solution to every problem.
But if there’s one thing software engineering teaches you—again and again—it’s this: Perfect doesn’t ship. Progress does.
Behind every product you love, every app you use daily, and every "it-just-works" moment, there’s a messy history of trade-offs, iterations, rewrites, and late-night breakthroughs. There’s never been a perfect version—only the best version for right now.
“If you’re aiming for perfection, you’ll never release,” he says. “But if you aim for learning, you’ll improve with every commit.”
That’s the shift that happens when you grow—not just as a coder, but as an engineer.
Early Career: Learning the Rules
Most engineers begin their journey by learning the rules.
Mid-Career: Building Beyond Code
As you gain experience, your job evolves. You're not just writing functions—you’re:
The Myth of Mastery
There’s a moment many engineers hit mid-career: you expect to feel confident, but instead, you feel behind.
Late Career: Scaling Impact
By the time you’re a senior or staff engineer, the problems you solve are rarely just technical.
Letting Go to Grow
So what does it really mean to grow as a software engineer?
Final Thoughts: We’re All Still Learning
No matter where you are in your career—just starting out, mid-level and unsure, or senior and scaling—remember this:
You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to keep learning.
Great software is built by people who care enough to try, fail, ask, share, and try again.
People like Abhishek Desikan, who show that engineering is not just about building products—it’s about building people, teams, and ethical systems that serve others well.
“We’re not just writing code,” Desikan reminds us. “We’re writing the story of how people experience technology.”
And when we do that with care—even if it’s not perfect—we’re already doing something right.]]></summary>

We will explore the reasons behind the problem and provide actionable solutions to ensure optimal performance.
Understanding the Issue
The code example provided describes a puzzle generator that works based on a Latin square. Running four different tasks concurrently should ideally distribute the CPU load effectively across available cores. However, when tested on iOS 15, it appears that only one task is being executed at a time. This…]]></summary>

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US Vice President JD Vance will speak at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, roughly a year after then-presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at the same event.
According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. 
Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning.
Though Vance is a Bitcoin (BTC) holder — he holds $250,000 to $500,001 worth of the cryptocurrency, according to a financial disclosure filed in…]]></summary>

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much ETH they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: 
“Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment.

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential election.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

Instead, real-world use cases like student loans backed by DeFi may be crypto’s most convincing value proposition to date.

On April 30th, Pencil Finance, a project supported by Animoca Brands and its education arm Open Campus, announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative aimed at providing cheaper, blockchain-backed loans.

“Once we commence business activities, we will be able to offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA [European Economic Area] under MiFID II,” said Gemini’s head of Europe, Mark Jennings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott blamed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act’s failure on partisan politics during a Senate speech on May 8.
Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

The seizure, announced on May 9 by Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and Frankfurt’s main prosecutor’s office, involved multiple crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Dash (DASH). The move marks the third-largest crypto confiscation in the BKA’s history.
The authorities also seized eXch’s German server infrastructure with over eight terabytes of data and shut down the platform, the announcement added.

When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?
It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.
