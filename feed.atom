        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I learn more about cloud computing and AWS, I came across EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – a service that enables me run virtual servers in the cloud. These instances gave me full control over how to set them up and access them.
To connect to an EC2 instance securely, I used SSH (Secure Shell). Since I’m on a Windows machine I used a free tool called PuTTY, which helps me manage my instances both safely and conveniently.
SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure way to connect to a remote device like a server. Instead of typing in a password I used a key pair – a public key stored on the server and a private key saved safely on my computer.
To connect to AWS instance I followed below steps using PuTTY on Windows.
What I Used:
A running EC2 instance on AWS
A .ppt key pair that I downloaded when launching the instance
PuTTY installed on my PC.
I opened PuTTY.
In the Host Name field, I entered the public IP of my EC2 instance (from the AWS console).
Under Connection → SSH → Auth, I browsed and selected my .ppk file.
I clicked Open to start the session.
When prompted for a username, I used ec2-user for Amazon Linux
PuTTY is lightweight and easy to use. It helps me:
Save sessions for quick connections
Use terminal commands like I would on a Linux server
Learning how to connect to AWS EC2 instances using SSH and PuTTY has been a valuable experience. It helped me understand the basics of secure server management and gives me hands-on practice in cloud computing.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

Well…let me tell you something. Choosing your HTTP client was just the beginning. 
You know what happens next right? Your APIs start changing, types drift, errors pop up everywhere, and suddenly you're spending more time debugging API calls than building features. Sound familiar?


  
  
  The Problem Nobody Talks About


First thing first. Your project starts small. A few API calls here and there, maybe some user auth, simple data fetching. Everything works fine with basic fetch or axios calls.
APIs change without warning (classic backend team move)
Your TypeScript interfaces don't match what the API actually returns
Error handling is all over the place

TLDR: A designers brain is wired differently, and as a logical thinker you will never be able to comprehend their deep state of being.
As a developer, it's not necessary to adapt this state. After all - designers and developers are completely different roles. But it sure helps if you know at least some basics. So here are 5 tips that I use to avoid building crappy apps and make something usable.

I recently built a tool called tilegen, which is essentially a tile generator that slices up a high-res image into thousands of tiles across multiple zoom levels, just like Google Maps does (well, almost). This post is a deep dive into what tilegen is, how it works, the quirks I ran into, and how mapping giants like Google do it too.
At its core, tilegen takes a massive image (like a satellite photo, map scan, game world, or giant illustration), and cuts it into 256×256 PNG tiles across zoom levels. These tiles can then be loaded on demand by a viewer, allowing users to pan and zoom without downloading gigabytes of image data up front.

Quick story: My coding journey started with writing assembly code by hand on exam papers, forums full of chaos, and messaging colleagues on MSN (because phone calls? Nah). Then came Stack Overflow (lifesaver), modern docs, interactive courses, and things got easier—but we still spent hours debugging weird edge cases.
Then a few months back, my PhD friend drops:
“You know you can talk to AI about this, right?”
I’m like, “F.ck.”
Now?
I chat with Gemini for big-picture brainstorming,
Claude for code generation,
GPT (aka Goker-ish) for chaotic brilliance and alternative ideas.
I even use AI for my art project, Echoneo.

According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said:
“We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions."

According to a May 27 announcement, the strategies will include buying undervalued biotech companies, purchasing “distressed Bitcoin claims” like those associated with crypto hacks and bankruptcies, and acquiring bottom tranches of Bitcoin credit vehicles at discounted prices. 
“ [...] our alpha-generating Bitcoin accumulation strategies are designed to drive sustained outperformance relative to Bitcoin itself, which requires a new valuation framework,” Strive CEO Matt Cole said.

Bitcoin could turn parabolic if prices move above $115,000 to liquidate more than $7 billion in short positions.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit-taking from BTC investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.

XRP derivatives markets turn bearish amid reducing institutional demand, suggesting further downside for XRP price.

XRP’s descending triangle breakout could lead to a decline toward $1.96.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 45% since April 7 lows to trade at $2.31 on May 27. But the price remains 31% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns about XRP’s ability to rise higher.
Will XRP’s price drop from the current levels in the coming days?
XRP derivatives data lean bearish  
One of the clearest signs that there could be trouble ahead for XRP is the presence of neutral funding rates and decreasing open interest (OI) in its futures markets.

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>

Platforms like Nexo provide tailored solutions, but thorough research is essential to ensure security and regulatory compliance.

Bitcoin futures flip bearish with a 43% decline in perpetual CVD.

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.
