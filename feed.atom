  Introduction


ArkTS imposes constraints on certain TypeScript features to enhance development correctness and runtime efficiency. This article lists the constrained features and provides code refactoring suggestions. ArkTS retains most TypeScript syntax, and code refactored according to this guide remains valid TypeScript code.
Original TypeScript code using the var keyword:
function addTen(x: number): number {
  var ten = 10;
  return x + ten;
}

Refactored code:
function addTen(x: number): number {
  let ten = 10;
  return x + ten;
}

Errors: Constraints that must be followed. Violations will cause compilation failures.
Warnings: Recommended constraints. Violations currently do not affect compilation but may cause failures in the futur…]]></summary>

Let’s say you’ve been using GitHub under your personal identity — maybe something like TrollCoder. Everything’s been smooth until you get hired, they give you a corporate email, and set you up with a company GitHub or GitLab account.
Suddenly, you're expected to use your real name and photo in commit history — but your next commit to a work project shows up as TrollCoder:

😱 Awkward. Especially if your Git identity shows ties to a different company...
Bottom line: if you work for multiple clients or just want clean separation between personal and professional activity — it's crucial to manage Git identity per project.
A few Git facts:
Git stores your name and email globally.

Proper observability tracks application and infrastructure activity, provides core insights into performance and system health, and allows IT teams to quickly identify and solve problems before they impact end users.
The best way to implement observability is by setting up observability tools within your infrastructure. Once correctly implemented, these tools can detect performance issues, security threats, and health threats, providing full visibility into the system.
Datadog and Splunk are the leading observability tools with unique features. While both platforms offer monitoring and analytics features, Datadog is typically favored for modern DevOps workflows and cloud environments, where…]]></summary>

While this abundance might seem like a dream, it often leads to what researchers call "choice overload," leaving us overwhelmed and unsure where to start. We've all felt the frustration of endless scrolling on Netflix or Spotify, relying on opaque algorithms to tell us what to consume.
These complex, machine learning-driven recommendation systems have become ubiquitous, yet a growing dissatisfaction with their black-box nature and tendency to create "filter bubbles" has fueled a demand for more authentic, human-centric alternatives.

I love Figma. But exporting animated prototypes as smooth videos? Painful.  
You either screen record your screen (and crop it manually), or you give up.

I got tired of that — so I built Flowshot.
With Flowshot, you can:
Export any Figma prototype as MP4 or GIF

Preserve transitions and animation timing
Choose frame size, speed, loop mode
All in just a few clicks
And yes — it’s free, open source, and no watermark.
Under the hood, it uses:
Playwright to simulate Figma playback
ffmpeg to generate clean video/gif output
A simple REST API (for devs)
A Figma plugin (for designers)
A cross platform desktop app built on top of the core API for easier management
You just click “Record”, and it does the rest.
I needed it. Simple as that.

And I know a lot of other designers and devs do too.
I care about tools that help people express ideas — without getting stuck on dumb limitations.
👉 Install the Figma plugin

Would love your feedback, ideas, or even PRs.

10 years ago it was the Deep Learning hype, when companies of all sorts (including the one I was working back then) thought that Deep Learning for Computer Vision was all about training neural networks from scratch, without thinking of deployment and operationalisation (aka fancy ML without Ops).

React is not the best JavaScript framework/library.
There. I said it.
It’s not the fastest. It’s not the cleanest. It’s not the most bug-free. Heck, it’s not even the most elegant. But it is the most famous. And that counts for more than you might think.
So, if you're here to see React get glorified like a golden retriever with a PhD in Computer Science, sorry to disappoint. This is not that blog. But if you're here to understand why React continues to dominate, even though it feels like it's held together by JSX, duct tape, and vibes—buckle up, my friend.

Everybody knows React.

No more CLI flags: Skip --aws-profile on every command, just use --stage and you're done.
Safer workflows: Avoid accidentally deploying to production from your dev environment.
Reusable pattern: Set it once, add new environments in seconds, ideal for scaling teams and CI/CD pipelines.

Just when you've finally wrapped your head around React hooks, someone drops a tweet about how "Qwik is the future" and suddenly you're questioning your entire career choice. Sound familiar? Welcome to framework fatigue—the special kind of exhaustion that only web developers truly understand.
"The average enterprise application now uses 14.5 JavaScript libraries and frameworks; 71% of developers report experiencing 'framework fatigue'
Remember when you first learned JavaScript? Those simple days of document.getElementById() and feeling like a wizard when you made something move on screen? Fast forward to today, where setting up a "simple project" means:
Choosing between 37 frameworks
Installing 4,328 dependencies
Configuring webpack (or wait, should I use Vite now? Or Turbopack? Or...)
Staring blankly at your terminal as error messages scroll by
Questioning all your life choices

It's no wonder we're tired. We're not just building websites anymore—we're maintaining an entire ecosystem of tools just to begin with a project.
Nothing triggers developer anxiety quite like a Medium article titled "Why [Your Current Framework] Is Dead." Suddenly, that project you've spent months mastering feels like a career liability. The subreddit threads don't help either:
"Anyone still using React in 2025 is basically writing COBOL."
"Switched to Svelte and now I can build in 3 hours what took 3 weeks in Angular."
"My cat learned Solid.js and now she's making $250k at a start-up."
Fear-of-being-left-behind creates self-fulfilling prophecies because developers abandon perfectly good tools to avoid being obsoleted.
This isn't just annoying—it's psychologically damaging. We're creating a generation of developers who feel perpetually behind despite working harder than ever to keep up.]]></summary>
