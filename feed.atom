        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the growing adoption of AI agents and LLM-powered applications, securing the communication layer between these systems has become critical.
At Zuplo, we've introduced two new Zuplo policies designed specifically to protect endpoints used by AI agents, LLMs and MCP servers: Prompt Injection Detection and Secret Masking.
These policies work seamlessly with our recently launched remote MCP server support, but they're equally valuable for any API endpoint that interfaces with LLMs or AI agents.
Want to see these policies in action with a remote MCP server and OpenAI? See the video below!





  
  
  Why These Policies Matter


AI agents often process user-generated content and make API calls based on that input. This creates two primary security risks:

En una aplicación pequeña, podrías tener los cables y las tuberías a la vista, mezclados con los muebles. Al principio no es un gran problema. Pero, ¿qué pasa cuando la casa se vuelve una mansión? Si un enchufe deja de funcionar, tendrías que romper paredes y mover muebles solo para encontrar el cable defectuoso. Si quieres cambiar la calefacción, podrías dañar el sistema de agua sin querer.

Neon Drift is a top-down infinite runner game with neon aesthetics, drift mechanics, and an upgrade system. I chose to create this game because:
• I've always been fascinated by arcade-style games with simple yet addictive mechanics
The game challenges players to navigate through an endless track, collecting energy orbs with funny faces while avoiding obstacles. As you progress, the game speed increases, making it progressively more challenging.
Throughout the development process, I learned several effective prompting techniques:

Refer to the article HarmonyOS Flutter Practice: 01-Building the development environment to build the development environment. IDE Install DevEco and VsCode/Android Studio.
If it is vscode, you can add the following configuration in the .vscode/launch.json file
{
"name": "ohos-app (attach mode)",
"cwd": "packages/apps/ohos_app",
"request": "attach",
"type": "dart",
},
{
"name": "ohos_app",
"cwd": "packages/apps/ohos_app",
"request": "launch",
"type": "dart"
},

After adding successfully, the launch option will appear in the Tab column of running and scheduling. Two configurations are added here, one is the Attach mode and the other is the normal running mode.
To view logs, you can view the Flutter project logs in the IDE debugging console where Flutter is running, and you can use the hdc hilog command or DevEco to view the system logs.
There are two main debugging solutions.
Run the Flutter project directly in the IDE. You can choose Andriod Studio or VsCode for the IDE. Click Debug in the debug bar to run.
Adapt to DecEco to run the Harmony project. Note that you need to open the ohos Harmony directory code. After the IDE analysis is completed, click Run.
When the app is successfully launched on the Harmony device, immediately call up the Command Pallet in Vscode, find Flutter Attach, and connect the Flutter debugger to the host machine
Then add breakpoints, use hot reload to reload Flutter, and debug the project code.
You need to use DevEcho to open the project, click the Debug Entry button next to Run, and start program debugging.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HarmonyOS Flutter hybrid development mainly has two forms.
Package the flutter module into a har package and introduce it in the native Harmony project as a har package.
The advantage is that the main project developer does not need to pay attention to the Flutter implementation and does not need to install and configure the Flutter development environment. The disadvantage is that the Flutter code cannot be modified in time and there is no hot reload.
Introduce the Flutter module in the native Harmony project through source code dependency.
The advantage is that it is easy to maintain and update the Flutter code, and hot reload can also be used. The disadvantage is that the Flutter development environment needs to be built and the developers need to master Flutter.
Its project structure is similar to the following:

TL;DR: Built an AI mentor for laid-off developers. Looking for alpha testers. 2-min quiz at the bottom.
"We're optimizing our development team with AI tools."
Sound familiar? It's the corporate way of saying "we're replacing developers with ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot."
I've seen it happen to:
my friends who graduated from bootcamps
my friends are developers in their companies 
Countless freelancers losing clients to "AI-powered solutions"
Here's the irony: We're getting replaced by AI, but most of us don't know how to USE AI to create our own products.
We can build complex applications for others, but when it comes to:
Validating a product idea
Choosing the right business model
Marketing and user acquisition
Thinking like founders vs employees
...we're lost.
So we are building AI Founder - an AI mentor that teaches developers how to go from idea to deployed MVP in a week.
Not just "write code faster" - but:
The job market isn't getting better. AI will continue eating junior/mid-level roles.
But here's what AI can't do: Replace human creativity and the ability to identify real problems.
That's our superpower. We just need to learn how to wield it.
I need 50 developers to test this concept:
Ideal tester:
Junior/Mid-level developer (0-5 years experience)
Recently laid off or struggling with freelance stability

Has an idea (even vague) for a product
Can spend 3-5 hours/week testing and giving feedback
What you get:
6 months free access (worth $174)
Direct line to me for feedback and questions
"Pioneer" badge in our community
First chance at any additional tools we build
What I need from you:
Honest feedback on the AI mentor
Weekly 15-min check-ins during testing
Help us improve the product for other developers
Take our 2-minute qualification quiz:
landing-ai-founder.up.railway.app
Taking 50 testers for this round.
What's your experience with AI replacing dev roles? Share in the comments!]]></summary>
