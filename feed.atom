        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first time I encountered state management in Vue, I was overwhelmed. I was building a simple dashboard application that had grown from a weekend project into something much more complex. Components were passing props six levels deep, and emitting events that would get lost in the hierarchy. I remember thinking, "There has to be a better way."
That's when I discovered Vuex. It felt like finding an oasis in the desert. But as time passed and my projects grew more complex, I started to feel the pain points. The boilerplate code, the mutations that seemed redundant, the TypeScript support that always felt a bit bolted on rather than built-in.
Then came Pinia, and it was like a breath of fresh air. In this article, I want to share my journey with Pinia, how it transformed my approach to sta…]]></summary>

Every developer has seen it:
“I don’t know what this code does, but if I delete it, things break.”
“Nobody knows who wrote it. But it’s working, somehow.”
No comments. No documentation. Even version control can’t explain it. And yet, if you remove it, your app stops behaving correctly.
Until now, we didn’t have a word for this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Will Ai replace programmers" by AI 
The idea that "AI will replace programmers" is a hot (and often exaggerated) debate. Here’s my take:  
AI Won’t Replace Programmers—But It Will Change the Job.
-AI is a tool, not a replacement. Just like calculators didn’t replace mathematicians, AI (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Devin) will automate parts of coding (boilerplate, debugging, docs) but can’t:
1 Understand complex business needs or ambiguous human requirements.
2 Design creative architectures or novel solutions.
3 Make ethical/critical decisions (e.g., privacy, security, trade-offs).



Programming is more than writing code. It’s problem-solving, collaboration, and adapting to chaos—things AI struggles with.  
The “Junior Dev” Role Might Shrink

AI can already:


Generate simple code snippets.

Fix common bugs.

Answer Stack Overflow-style questions.




Entry-level tasks may get automated, forcing new programmers to upskill faster (e.g., focus on system design, domain expertise).  


Future Programmers Will Look Different


Shift from “writing code” to “orchestrating AI.” Example prompts:  
“Design a scalable API for X, optimize for cost, and explain trade-offs.”




More emphasis on:
Soft skills (stakeholder communication, UX empathy).

Domain knowledge (healthcare, finance, etc.).

AI-augmented workflows (prompt engineering, validation).




Historical Parallels


Fear: “High-level languages will kill coding!” → Instead, demand exploded.  


Fear: “No-code tools will replace devs!” → They just enabled non-devs.  


AI will likely create new roles we can’t yet imagine. 




  
  
  Bottom Line



Worst-case: Low-end coding jobs decline; programmers need to adapt.

Best-case: AI removes grunt work, letting devs focus on harder, more meaningful problems.

My advice: Learn to leverage AI, but double down on uniquely human skills (creativity, critical thinking, leadership).

Sometimes, during development or debugging, you need to quickly enable or disable logging globally across your entire JavaScript application. Here's a straightforward approach to achieve this.
console.log


Before we override the console.log function, it's crucial to keep a reference to the original function.
let original_console_log = console.log;

This ensures you can restore the original functionality anytime you want.
Next, create a function that can toggle logging on and off by replacing console.log.
let logging_enabled = true;

function set_logging(enabled) {
    logging_enabled = enabled;
    console.log = enabled ? original_console_log : function () {};
}

⏰ Your user in Tokyo picks 2 PM → New York sees 1 AM 💀

📅 Calendar exports show wrong times

🌍 DST changes break everything  
Here’s how I built a converter that handles all this – and how you can clone it.  
Step 1: Steal My Base Code




git clone https://github.com/codewithmikee/laravel-timezone-handler  

Why start from scratch? This includes:  
Pre-built service class

Working demo UI

Passing tests (mostly 😉)





  
  
  Step 2: The Magic Methods


Convert Anywhere → UTC
// Static call (no user context)  
$utcTime = UserTimeZoneHandler::toUtc(  
    '2023-01-01 14:00',   
    'Asia/Tokyo'  
);  

User-Friendly Instance Mode
// In controller  
$handler = new UserTimeZoneHandler($user->timezone);  

// All conversions use the user’s zone  
$localTime = $handler->toUserTimeZone($event->start_time);  

Step 3: Avoid My Carbon Mistake


I wasted hours on this failed test:
public function testGoogleFormatting() {  
    $time = Carbon::parse(...); // Fails!  
}  

Why? Laravel extends Carbon. Always use:
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon; // Not Carbon\Carbon!  

Step 4: Add Your Secret Sauce




New Calendar Provider?




// Add to formatForProvider()  
'zoom' => $utcTime->format('Ymd\THis\Z')  

Custom Time Ranges




$converted = UserTimeZoneHandler::convertTimeRanges(  
    $businessHours,  
    'America/Chicago',  
    'Europe/Paris'  
);  

Step 5: Launch Your Demo





php artisan serve  

Visit http://localhost:8000/timezone-converter to see:

  
Why This Works



✅ Handles 597 timezones (including weird ones like Australia/Lord_Howe)

✅ Tests cover DST/edge cases

✅ No hidden dependencies



Clone & Customize:

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”
For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (…]]></summary>

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

According to New Zealand Police, the man is one of 13 individuals charged after authorities executed search warrants across Auckland, Wellington, and California over the past three days.
The charges stem from allegations that members of an organized criminal group manipulated seven victims to obtain large amounts of cryptocurrency, which was then laundered through multiple platforms between March and August 2024.
The US Department of Justice has indicted the man under federal law, including charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and conspirac…]]></summary>

Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight.
“The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.”

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”

"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote."
