The agreement, formalized during the Dubai fintech Summit on May 12, is part of Dubai’s cashless strategy, which hopes to foster the city’s transition to “a fully digital, cashless society,” by introducing “a new digital payment channel across its official platforms,” the Dubai Department of Finance (DOF) said on May 12.
Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

We'll explore each with simple JavaScript examples to make them easier to understand.
1️⃣ Encapsulation — Hiding the Complexity
Example:

By Dhanian | Author of How APIs Work: The Invisible Force Behind Modern Apps
APIs power nearly every app you use today—from weather updates to payment systems. But what is an API, and how does it work? Let’s break it down using a familiar setting: a restaurant. This analogy will help you visualize the invisible magic behind software communication.
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge that allows two systems to communicate. Think of it as a messenger that delivers your request to a system and returns the response back to you.
In software terms:
The client (like your app or browser) wants something.
The API receives the request and talks to the server.
The server sends back data via the API.

This is a submission for the Amazon Q Developer https://dev.to/challenges/aws-amazon-q-v2025-04-30
What I Built
Built using Python, Streamlit, and AWS (Translate & Polly), it offers an intuitive interface for translating English text into several languages and listening to the correct pronunciation. It's an ideal foundation for educational tools, language learning platforms, or voice-enabled applications.
Key Features
Demo

Code Repository
https://github.com/MahalakshmiM54/Language-learning-bot
How I Used Amazon Q Developer
🧠 Refactoring Python logic to streamline AWS Translate and Polly calls
Amazon Q Developer significantly accelerated development by offering real-time coding suggestions, bug fixes, and architectural advice — all directly from the command line.
Final Thoughts
I'm proud of how seamlessly the bot handles translation and speech synthesis, and I'm excited to enhance it further—possibly by adding speech input, progress tracking for learners, and more supported languages.
👩‍💻 Individual Submission
💡 Tips & Insights
Use inline suggestions to quickly resolve syntax issues or logic bugs, especially when working with external libraries like boto3.
Take advantage of real-time CLI support to configure cloud resources without leaving your development environment.
Boost efficiency by letting Amazon Q handle repetitive setup and error handling, so you can stay focused on building features that matter.

Developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be costly, especially during the development phase. Each API call to services like OpenAI or Anthropic consumes tokens, and these costs can accumulate rapidly during iterative development and debugging.
I developed Copilot Proxy to address this issue. It's a local API proxy that routes your LLM requests to GitHub Copilot, maximizing your free quota usage and minimizing your API costs.
Some developers turn to local solutions like Ollama, which allows running open-source models such as LLaMA and Mistral locally. While this approach offers privacy and cost benefits, it comes with certain limitations:

Processing nonlinear constraints in MATLAB's fmincon function can sometimes lead to puzzling errors, particularly the message stating that the nonlinear constraint function is undefined at the initial point. This can be particularly confusing when the command window indicates that the function is indeed defined for the initial guess. In this article, we will explore the causes of this error and provide a step-by-step guide to resolving it.
Understanding the Issue
When using fmincon for optimization in MATLAB, the function evaluates constraints to determine whether the initial point provided (in this case x0) is feasible. The error message you've encountered, "Nonlinear constraint function is undefined at initial point," often arises due to one of the following reasons:

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion by: Robin Singh, CEO of Koinly
Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into th…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Backpack announced that customers of the defunct crypto exchange FTX EU can begin reclaiming their funds through its service.
According to a May 12 X post, Backpack now allows FTX EU users who selected it as the redistribution platform to claim their euro balance. Users must first complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
Backpack’s support page also said that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU:
“If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.”
