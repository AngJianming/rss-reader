In the fast-paced digital age of today, it's not sufficient for websites to display images.
And that's where AI-based Image Recognition comes in to transform the way users engage with content.
What is Image Recognition, Actually?
With machine learning models trained on millions of images, AI can now:
Recognize objects, people, scenes, and emotions
Automatically label and tag images
Enable visual search (image search, not text search)
Moderate user-uploaded content for safety and suitability
It's not only innovation — it's the new standard.

Why Your Website Needs Image Recognition — Today

Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) lives or dies on that first hop—can the system put the right snippets in front of the language model?

In this post, we peel back the buzzwords (BM25, EM@5, F1) and show how to turn them into levers you can actually pull.
End‑to‑end metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, human ratings) blur two questions together:
Did I pull the right passages?
Did the generator use them well?
Untangling the knot matters. If you log a 5‑point jump in answer F1, you want to know where the jump came from—better retrieval, a smarter prompt, or a lucky seed? The retrieval metrics below give you that X‑ray.

Agentica is a TypeScript AI framework specialized in Function Calling.
Github Repository: https://github.com/wrtnlabs/agentica

Guide Documents: https://wrtnlabs.io/agentica



By simply listing functions, you can create an AI agent more easily than with any other AI framework, while maintaining a stable and flexible structure.
When you plug a TypeScript class into Agentica, its functions are appropriately called by AI Function Calling. If you bring in React Native's Mobile API functions, you can create a mobile assistant with higher quality than Apple's Siri.
Additionally, if you import a Swagger/OpenAPI document, Agentica will appropriately call your backend APIs, and even when integrating with MCP, its stability will be in a different league compared to other AI frameworks.

Most tutorials out there use Passport.js to implement Google Sign-In in your app, but Passport’s default session-based approach is poorly documented and forces you to build your own user-creation and token-storage logic. It overcomplicates what should be a simple process.
In this guide, I’ll walk you through integrating Google’s officially supported Node.js Auth Library — clean, straightforward, and free from the usual headaches. I’ll also show you how to implement role-based access control so that admins can perform sensitive operations while regular users simply browse. By the end, you’ll have:
A clean login flow that issues access and refresh tokens
Automatic token renewal via an Axios interceptor
Middleware to validate tokens on every request

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

FT4 supports multiple account strategies. We’ll use two of them:

Connecting your agent to real tools like web search, file systems, APIs is messy, and complicated.

Launch separate MCP servers for each tool.
Manage server lifecycles manually.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below.

The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.
Although the rally has been accompanied by $3.06 billion in spot ETF inflows, there are doubts whether that is enough to break Bitcoin out of consolidation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wallet provider MetaMask is launching a crypto payments card that will allow users to spend self-custodied funds, offering crypto holders additional ways to use their tokens.
The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum.
The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion, an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space.

Crypto group asks Trump to end prosecution of crypto devs
The DeFi Education Fund has led an April 28 petition to White House crypto czar David Sacks asking to end what it claimed was the “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers, including Roman Storm, a creator of the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
The group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice's lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite growing competition from emerging issuers, the stablecoin market remains largely dominated by a few key players. According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt (USDT) continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies.
As of April 25, Tether has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC (USDC), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. 
Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. 
“With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said.

In a third reading on April 28 of Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay.
“This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025.

A week full of US macroeconomic reports could impact Bitcoin traders’ sentiment. 

Bitcoin’s rally could stall if there’s a sharp reduction in spot buy volumes.

If PCE, the ISM PMI, and jobs data align with market expectations, BTC could rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price could face a period of range-bound trading after managing a 10.37% rally over the past 7 days. Robust spot purchasing demand from Strategy, the spot BTC ETFs, and announcements from 21Shares and Coinbase played a role in Bitcoin’s rally to $95,700. With the exception of the April 28 announcement of a $1.42 billion BTC purchase from Strategy, a quiet week on the crypto news front could translate to a reduction in spot demand and lower support tests from Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin’s year-over-year return and realized price metric signal strong long-term support from holders and suggest that BTC is currently undervalued.

 Standard Chartered estimates a Bitcoin price target in the $110,000–$120,000 zone by Q2 2025.

Positive funding rates point to a potential long squeeze to $90,500.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly close near $94,000 delivered an impressive year-over-year total return of 53.61%. Since the last halving in 2024, the market has shifted from the early 2024 euphoric phase to a "mature bull trend" based on onchain growth, rather than speculative frenzy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin continues to face resistance at $95,000, but the possibility of an upside breakout remains high.

Solid spot Bitcoin ETF inflows do not always signal a short-term top.

Select altcoins are showing early signs of a short-term trend change.

Bitcoin (BTC) pierced the $95,000 resistance on April 28, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are trying to defend the level. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a move toward $100,000.
Another positive is that institutional demand seems to be back, as seen from the solid $3.06 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week. Although some instanc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

US Treasury funds saw $19 billion inflows, the highest since March 2023, as the 30-year yield fell 30 basis points.

Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%.

Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. 

The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion — the highest since March 2023.
