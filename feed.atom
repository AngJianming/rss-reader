Yet despite Docker's widespread adoption, a surprising number of organizations struggle with inefficient, insecure, and problematic Dockerfiles. These issues silently drain productivity, increase costs, and introduce security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle.
The numbers tell a concerning story:
The average container image in enterprise environments is 650MB - often 2-3x larger than necessary
Developers spend an average of 15-20 minutes daily waiting for Docker builds to complete
87% of container images contain at least one high or critical vulnerability
Only 35% of organizations have automated container security scanning

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will delve into the basic syntax and structure of the Cangjie language. These fundamental knowledge lay a solid foundation for writing efficient and maintainable code. By understanding statement structures, expressions, comments, and data types, you can use Cangjie for programming with greater confidence.
I. Basic Syntax
Assignment Statements: Used to assign values to variables.
let x: Int64 = 10
println(x)

output:10
Conditional Statements: Used to control the execution flow of a program.
if (x > 0) {
    println("x is +")  
}
output: x is +

for (i in 1..=5) {
    println(i) 
}

output: 1 2 3 4 5
Please translate the following text into English.
1.2 Expressions
Arithmetic Operations: Such as addition, subtraction, etc.
let a: Int64 = 1
let b: Int64 = 2
let sum: Int64 = a + b
println(sum)

output:3
Logical Operations: Such as AND, OR, etc.
if (a > 0 && b < 10) {
    println("a > 0 && b < 10") 
}

output:a > 0 && b < 10
II. Variable Naming and Identifiers Overview
III. Comments
3.1 Single-Line Comments
println("Welcome to Cangjie!")
output:Welcome to Cangjie!

3.2 Multi-Line Comments

func factorial(n: Int): Int {
}

IV. Data Types
Integer Types„ÄÅFloating-Point Types„ÄÅString Type„ÄÅBoolean Type
let age: Int64 = 25
let height: Float64 = 1.75
let name: String = "Cangjie" 
let isAdult: Bool = true

V. Control Structures
Use if, else if, and else for conditional judgment.
The for loop and while loop are used to repeatedly execute code blocks.
Summary
This article provides a comprehensive introduction to the basic syntax and structure of the Cangjie language, including statement structures, expressions, comments, data types, and control structures. Mastering these fundamental concepts will lay a solid foundation for subsequent programming learning and serve as the basis for creating efficient and maintainable code.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever built something that needed real-time updates and found yourself wondering if HTTP alone could cut it? I‚Äôve been there too. In this post, I‚Äôll walk you through the key differences between HTTP and WebSocket, technologies you‚Äôll often encounter when building modern web applications.
What‚Äôs the Core Difference?
Both HTTP and WebSocket are protocols used for communication between a client and a server. But they operate very differently and that matters a lot depending on what you're building.
HTTP: Request-Response, Stateless
HTTP is the way the web communicates. A client (like your browser) sends a request, and the server sends a response. That‚Äôs it. Once the transaction is done, the connection usually closes.
Great for:
- Web pages

- REST APIs

- Static resources

Not so great for:
- Anything that needs real-time data updates

WebSocket: Full-Duplex, Persistent
WebSocket is designed for continuous, two-way communication. After an initial handshake over HTTP, the connection upgrades to WebSocket and stays open. Both client and server can push messages to each other anytime.
Perfect for:
- Live chat

- Online games

- Stock tickers

Collaborative editing tools

HTTP runs securely over HTTPS. Well supported, widely used, and easy to scale.

WebSocket uses WSS (WebSocket Secure) for encrypted traffic. Requires a bit more care in implementation, especially with authentication and origin checks.

Both protocols are supported by all modern browsers and most cloud/server infrastructures.
If your app:
Only needs data when a user does something (like clicking a button)

Is stateless or RESTful

‚úÖ Use HTTP
If your app:
Needs to send or receive data without user action

Updates in real-time

üî• Go with WebSocket
Whether you're building a chat app or just exploring backend development, understanding the difference between HTTP and WebSocket will help you design smarter, more efficient systems.

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn‚Äôt need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity.¬†
But what‚Äôs the goal?¬†
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It‚Äôs not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical to learn how to spot the signs early.
