        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you tired of manually copying and pasting content between your LLM tools and Notion? Look no further! In this article, I'll show you how I leveraged MCP (Model Context Protocol) to automate your Notion workflow from Claude Desktop. 🎯
MCP provides a powerful way to:
Connect AI models with external data sources and tools
Break down information silos through standardized integrations
Enable dynamic, context-aware AI interactions
A Notion account (https://www.notion.so)
Claude Desktop app (https://claude.ai/download)
Go to Notion's integration settings

Create a new integration with a suitable name for example "Notion MCP"
Click "Save". It will generate your API key 
Copy your API key
Connect a target page with new integration. (Create a page-> click on 3 dotted-icon -> connections -> search integration)



{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer ntn_xxxxxx\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\" }"
      }
    }
  }
}

Edit the above pasted JSON code to include your Notion API key
Now that you have successfully configured the MCP server in your Claude desktop app. You can start using it to list, create, update and delete Notion pages. I was able to create, publish a research and it created a new page automatically within few minutes without opening the Notion in just single prompt -]]></summary>

The File System Access API (FS Access API) represents a landmark evolution in web technology, enabling web applications to interact directly with a user's local file system. This contrasts sharply with traditional web paradigms, which treat the file system as a sealed notebook, only accessible via upload mechanisms. The ability to read from and write to local files in a secure, efficient manner empowers developers to build highly interactive, desktop-like experiences directly within the browser.
Historically, browser security has heavily restricted access to the local file system. The introduction of the <input type="file"> element served as a workaround, allowing users to upload files from their machines, but it did not facilitate editing…]]></summary>

Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters.

Strategy’s stock rose 32% in April, its biggest monthly gain since November.

Speculation is building that Strategy will announce a major capital raise during its Q1 earnings call on May 1 as it continues to grow its Bitcoin holdings.

Analysts expect a 1% year-on-year revenue bump to $116.6 million, following the firm’s $120.7 million revenues for Q4 2024.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy closed April with its highest monthly gain since November, ahead of the firm’s highly anticipated earnings call on May 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s crypto-tied digital identity project World, formerly Worldcoin, has made its US debut in six cities. 
The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement.
World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. 
The firm had previously skirted launching in the US due to regulatory concerns over offering a token, fears now seemingly allayed with the crypto-friendly Trump administration.
The data from World’s Orb scan can be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform…]]></summary>

CertiK said in an April 30 X post that a total of $364 million was lost to exploits, hacks and scams in April, jumping from the $28.8 million recorded by CertiK in March. 
The firm added that white hat exploiters had returned around $18.2 million from exploits on the crypto protocols KiloEx, Loopscale and ZKsync, which brought down the month’s total.
The largest hack in April, and the fifth largest to date, involved an elderly US individual who lost 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million. The Bitcoin was stolen from their wallet after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access on A…]]></summary>

“It’s not easy to convert it, but if you manage to win in Bitcoin DeFi, you win the entire market.”

The House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92, on its third reading on April 30 by a vote of 71 to 44.
Republican House Speaker Destin Hall introduced the bill in February, which would allow the treasurer to allocate 5% of the state’s investments into designated digital assets.
The investments can only be made after obtaining an independent third-party assessment confirming that the crypto holdings are maintained with a secure custody solution and risk oversight and regulatory compliance standards are met.

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. 
“Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. 
The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws.

Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report.
“Alarmingly, the first quarter of 2025 alone saw the collapse of 1.8 million tokens,” he added, which is “the highest number of failures recorded in a single year.” It also comprises just under half of all failures and represents a quarter of all tokens launched since 2021.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto industry has seen a significant shift toward regulatory compliance since its early days, according to James Smith, co-founder of Elliptic, a crypto compliance firm established in 2013.
“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

The former Binance executive joined a fireside panel with macroeconomic analyst Raoul Pal to discuss the rationale behind his 2022 investment in X and artificial intelligence. Zhao said:
“I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don't have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.”  
“So, when we invested in Twitter back then, it was based on that philosophy,” Zhao continued.

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, Ether (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Related: Ripple acquisition of Hidden Road a ‘defining moment’ for XRPL — Ripple CTO
Ripple reportedly had an $11 billion valuation in 2024, an estimate CEO Brad Garlinghouse called “outdated” as of January. The blockchain company purchased prime broker Hidden Road for roughly $1.2 billion in April, claiming the move would help scale activity for XRP and XRP Ledger.
Court cases winding down
It’s unclear whether Ripple intends to pursue the Circle acquisition as the firm begins to clear some of its legal entanglements with US regulators. 
In August 2024, a court found Ripple liable for $125 million in a case with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) first filed in 2020. However, Garlinghouse announced in March that the SEC planned to drop its appeal against the firm over the ruling, with Ripple later stating it would pay a net $50 million for the lower court judgment.

Both announcements followed meetings between Garlinghouse and Ripple's chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, and US President Donald Trump. The blockchain firm contributed $5 million to Trump’s inauguration fund after his election victory, and both executives attended events as official guests on Jan. 20.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally. Several analysts are also optimistic that Bitcoin’s break will occur to th…]]></summary>

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.
According to Markova, dollar-pegged stablecoins operating in the European Union are already "having a massive headache," particularly from central banks. "Even tho…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.
