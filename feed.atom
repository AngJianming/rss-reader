        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 👋 Are you tired of the usual job application process—filling out endless forms, uploading resumes, and waiting for weeks to hear back? Well, I was too, so I decided to build a chatbot that makes the job application process feel like chatting with a friend. Let’s dive into how I created Quick Apply, a conversational job application bot, step by step!
What’s the Deal With Quick Apply?


Quick Apply is an interactive, chat-based job application tool. The idea is simple: instead of filling out boring forms, you chat with a bot that collects all the necessary information (name, email, answers to screening questions, and your CV). The best part? It actually feels like you're talking to a human—no more dry, robotic forms.
You can explore the project on GitHub or deploy it directly to …]]></summary>

Most breaches start with stolen credentials—not advanced hacking—and 80% involve compromised passwords.
AI is making account takeover attacks faster, smarter, and harder to detect, even bypassing MFA.
Traditional identity-based security isn’t enough; organizations need data-centric, zero-trust defenses.
Human risk management tools like Polymer detect and contain compromised accounts before damage spreads.
Despite what Hollywood might suggest, most data breaches don’t involve elite hackers cracking firewalls with lines of code. In reality, all it often takes is one stolen password. Just look at the Samsung breach last month—hackers used compromised credentials to access the personal data of over 270,000 customers.
This kind of incident isn’t rare. In fact, 80% of all hacking-rela…]]></summary>

If you're working in Swift and trying to leverage the Canvas preview feature in Xcode, you may encounter the frustrating issue where the code does not render properly. One common scenario arises when integrating Firebase into your Swift application, where the preview fails, often displaying build path errors related to Firebase components. In this article, we’ll explore why this issue occurs and provide actionable solutions to resolve it effectively.
Why Does This Happen?
The problem generally stems from compatibility issues between the Firebase SDK and your Xcode version, or misconfigured project settings. The Canvas preview relies on a stable build of your application, and any discrepancies, like unresolved paths or missing frameworks, can lead to preview problems. For insta…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a past blog post, I discussed using the fetch API to send requests to a server --- specifically, making HTTP requests to GET, POST, update data with PUT, or DELETE data. These are one-time, on-demand requests, which are particularly useful for working with static data.
However, when we need more frequent or continuous communication with a server, such as for a chat application or an online game, we can use a different approach: WebSocket.
The WebSocket API enables a two-way interactive communication session between a client and a server without the need for polling (constantly checking if new data is available).
There are several WebSocket API mechanisms:
WebSocket Interface
WebSocketStream Interface
WebTransport API
Here, I'll take a closer look at WebSocket.

Today, our digital infrastructure mirrors that layered reality. Security teams are tasked with safeguarding an environment built on top of earlier architectures, older assumptions, and interfaces that weren't designed for what they now support.

In this blog post I am going over a very important topic, which is building a framework of knowledge.
Building a framework of knowledge is all about understanding how the human mind stores information, which is through relations. We don't remember specific points of information as much as we remember how those points of information are related. 
For example, is there a song that every time it comes on, you remember where you were when you first heard it? Or is there a particular smell that always reminds you of your grandparents' house? Thi…]]></summary>

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to soon break past $100,000 and potentially hit a new all-time high as US President Donald Trump is set to announce a trade deal with the UK.
Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency passed Senate Bill 21 with no amendments on May 7 in a 9-4 vote along party lines. The bill has already passed the Texas Senate, in a 25-5 vote on March 6.  
SB 21 would establish the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” controlled by the state’s comptroller — currently Glenn Hegar — who would be permitted to invest in digital assets that have obtained a market cap of at least $500 billion over the last twelve months, which would currently only include Bitcoin (BTC).

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…]]></summary>

Core Scientific’s Q1 2025 results, published on May 7, saw it more than double its $210 million net income from the year-ago quarter, while its total revenue reached $79.5 million, missing Zacks analysts' estimates by 8.11%, and falling from its $179.3 million in revenues for Q1 2024. 
The firm’s primary source of revenue came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue, $3.8 million in hosted mining revenue, and $8.6 million in colocation, formerly listed as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting.

Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on May 7, which allows Arizona to claim ownership of abandoned digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications within three years.
The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.
“This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” the bill’s sponsor, Jeff Weninger, said in a May…]]></summary>

Zhao, also known as CZ, said on a Farokh Radio podcast episode aired May 6 that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers have already filed the paperwork on his behalf
“I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US.
Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.”
