It looks like those plans have been shelved, and pretty recently at that. Bloomberg reports that while the bitten fruit brand “has […]

It's lovely to ask an LLM one question and get one answer. But how about giving it your entire customer support operation? Or asking it to handle a big research project from beginning to end? This is where a standalone LLM, no matter how smart, falls a little short. It's like having a super-powerful brain but no arms or legs.
A single LLM is like a wonderful solo musician. It can perform wonders. But sometimes you require a symphony-an orchestra where various instruments play in coordination with each other in perfect harmony. That is precisely …]]></summary>

“It was the worst food I’ve ever had at a Trump golf course,” Nicholas Pinto told WIRED on May 23, while other attendees the outlet interviewed said that the meal was “OK, but not top-class.”
On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Set Theory might sound academic, but it’s everywhere in development - from deduplicating data to writing cleaner algorithms or SQL queries.
Note - Before we get into it, checkout original post on csprimer.in
A set is a well-defined, unordered collection of distinct elements. Think of it as a way to group things without duplicates.
Tabular form:
A = {apple, banana, orange}

Set-builder form:
B = {x | x is a prime number < 10} → {2, 3, 5, 7}

const permissions = new Set(['read', 'write', 'delete'])

function naturalNumbers() {
    let n = 1;
    while (true) n++;
}

const emptySet = new Set()


A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4}
A U B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4}
A ∩ B = {3}

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4}
A-B = {1, 2}

Sets help remove duplicates from lists like tags, cache, or user inputs.
const cache = new Set();
cache.add('user123');
cache.add('user123'); // Duplicate ignored

Set theory powers common SQL operations like UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.
SELECT id FROM active_users
UNION
SELECT id FROM premium_users;

const adminPermissions = new Set(['read', 'write', 'delete']);

function hasPermission(roleSet, action) {
    return roleSet.has(action);
}

hasPermission(adminPermissions, 'delete'); // true

Set Theory helps developers write cleaner, more efficient code. Whether it’s handling unique values, writing SQL queries sets are a fundamental tool worth mastering.]]></summary>

From personal assistants to decision-making bots, AI agents are rapidly becoming integral to modern workflows, especially in areas that demand high cognitive effort and multitasking.
One compelling use case? Financial analysis.
AI agents are autonomous systems capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning about it, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. Think of them like digital co-workers that operate without you constantly feeding them instructions. They can gather data, assess situations, make decisions, and even adapt over time.

Bugfree



Some context: ZenTao is the current name (https://github.com/easysoft/zentaopms), Sanplex is a new invented name, and Bugfree is our original name from a decade ago — which we recently reacquired.
What’s your gut feeling? Which one would you be more likely to click on, or trust as a PM tool? No marketing here, just honestly curious how these land with people who work in tech/product.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost artificial intelligence chip specifically for China, following restrictions on exporting its more expensive model.
Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.
An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters it was still evaluating the company’s limited options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from Chin…]]></summary>

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

"I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose," Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.
HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July
In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australian Senator Gerard Rennick has drawn criticism from the Bitcoin community following his remarks referring to Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme and questioning the asset’s value because it can’t be eaten.
“You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.
Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy, regardless of how widespread crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade.
“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>
