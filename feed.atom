        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most users deploy SafeLine WAF to protect public web apps — but what about SafeLine’s own management console?
By default, SafeLine’s admin dashboard runs on port 9443. If this port is exposed directly to the internet, it's a potential target for scanners, bots, and brute-force attacks. That’s a risk you shouldn’t ignore.
Here’s how to use SafeLine to protect its own login portal — a clever self-defense trick that adds an extra security layer without extra tools.
Even though the admin UI is password-protected, leaving it open to the internet means:
Attackers can scan and probe it 24/7

Exploits or zero-days could be attempted

Admins have no visibility unless logs are manually checked
A more secure setup is to route access to the admin panel through SafeLine itself — just like any other protected app.
Go to the SafeLine dashboard and create a new application to protect.
Internal target: https://127.0.0.1:9443


External port: Choose something like 19443 to avoid conflicts
This effectively puts SafeLine’s own dashboard behind its WAF.

To avoid direct exposure:
❌ Close port 9443 in your security group or firewall

✅ Open the new external port 19443 (or your chosen value)
Now try accessing SafeLine:

✅ https://your-server-ip:19443 — should work via SafeLine

❌ https://your-server-ip:9443 — should be blocked completely
Try running a simple attack pattern against 19443 — like an SQL injection or admin fuzz. You should see SafeLine detect and block it:


This proves SafeLine is now actively guarding its own admin panel — a neat example of defensive recursion.
This setup isn’t just cool — it’s practical. By placing SafeLine’s own admin interface behind itself, you:
Reduce attack surface

Gain full audit logging of access attempts

Get real-time protection without extra software
If you're running SafeLine in production or even just testing it in public environments, locking down port 9443 should be your first move.

But before you dive headfirst into the exhilarating world of startups, there's a fundamental question every founder must answer: How will you fuel your vision? Broadly, two paths diverge: seeking Venture Capital (VC) funding or embracing the often grittier, yet incredibly rewarding, path of bootstrapping. This isn't just a financial decision; it's a choice that shapes your company's culture, your control, and your growth trajectory.

The 17th series of bonds, issued on May 29, comes with a face value of $525,000 each and will mature on Nov. 28, 2025. Unlike traditional debt instruments, these bonds yield no interest, allowing Metaplanet to borrow without additional repayment costs.
Under the terms, Evo Fund is entitled to early redemption by giving at least five business days’ notice. The bonds can be redeemed in full or in part, in multiples of $525,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

Let me break down the key actions I learned: Select, Update, Create, and Remove elements from the DOM.
Selecting Elements


To manipulate anything in the DOM, first we need to select it. Here are some common methods:
document.getElementById("myId");            // Select by ID
document.getElementsByClassName("myClass"); // Select by class (HTMLCollection)
document.getElementsByTagName("div");       // Select by tag name
document.querySelector(".myClass");         // Select first match[TBD]
document.querySelectorAll("p");             // Select all matching[TBD]


Example:
const heading = document.getElementById("main-heading");

Updating Elements


Once selected, we can update their content or style:
const title = document.getElementById("id name");
title.textContent = "Welcome to my site!";
title.style.color = "blue";

Example:
document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "This is a new paragraph text!";

Creating Elements


We can dynamically create elements and add them to the page:
const newElement = document.createElement("div");
newElement.textContent = "I was created using JS!";
document.getElementById("id name").appendChild(newElement);

You can also set attributes:[TBD]
newElement.setAttribute("class", "new-class");

Removing Elements


Finally, we can remove elements from the DOM:
const elementToRemove = document.getElementById("id name");
elementToRemove.remove();

Or using the parent element:[TBD]
const parent = document.getElementById("container");
const child = document.getElementById("item");
parent.removeChild(child);




Action
Method




Select

getElementById, querySelector



Update

textContent, innerHTML, style



Create

createElement, appendChild



Remove

remove(), removeChild()




Learning the DOM opened up a whole new level of interaction with web pages. It's like learning how to control every part of a website from JavaScript. I'm excited to use these techniques in my future projects!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
The May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.
Instead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. 
“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.
The letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.
Favorable regulatory environment
The SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.
Atkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.

The following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.
In a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.

“We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.
“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.
“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. 
The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.
Court “blows a hole in trade talks”
Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”
Bitcoin’s (BTC) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarke…]]></summary>

The strength of Bitcoin’s (BTC) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28.

Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30.
Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”
Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New Jersey county is set to tokenize $240 billion worth of property deeds after signing a deal with the blockchain-backed land record management firm Balcony.
Balcony said on May 28 that it signed a five-year deal with the Bergen County Clerk’s Office to tokenize 370,000 deeds on the Avalanche blockchain, adding that this was “the largest blockchain-based deed tokenization project in US history.”
Bergen County is New Jersey’s most populous county and is located northwest of Manhattan in New York City across the Hudson River. Bergen County has nearly 1 million residents, producing around $500 million in annual property tax revenue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key point:

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

Conduit markets its payment system as an alternative to the messaging network SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Banks have relied on the SWIFT protocol to process wire transfers since the 1970s. 
Conduit claims its platform offers a modern alternative, enabling near real-time cross-border settlements by combining stablecoins with local fiat currencies through crypto infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cork Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, was hit by a smart contract exploit on May 28, resulting in the loss of roughly $12 million in digital assets.
Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.
Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home.
