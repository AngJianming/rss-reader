I ranted previously about the awful state of .NET socket libraries for game devs. I originally developed my new socket library inside the confines of my Jawbone lib, but the project evolved enough and sparked enough interest from third parties that I decided it was worth spinning off into its own focused project.
Introducing... Jawbone.Sockets!
Be sure to take a tour to become familiar with the API design. The sockets perform zero allocation (beyond the socket creation itself), and they indeed perform better than System.Net sockets, but the more time I spend with this library, the more I just enjoy the drastically simplified design.

Frosty mornings, cozy nights, and winter's gentle charm,

As autumn's leaves surrender to winter's whispered form.
A serene silence falls, and enchantment fills the air,
Winter's magic unfolds, beyond compare.
The chill of morning whispers secrets to the bold,
As frosty winds caress the snow-covered streets to unfold.
The morning light casts warmth on winter's wonderland so bright,
A magical, where every moment feels just right.
Winter nights, a cozy warmth, a crackling fire, hot chocolate's delight,
Twinkling lights, marshmallows roasting, laughter in the night.
A reminder that life's simplest pleasures bring the most magic spell,
Winter nights, a time to cherish, and love that all can tell.
A season of wonder, a magical playground so grand,
Ice-skating thrills, snowshoeing serenity, nature's beauty to unfurl and stand.
Snow-covered mountains, frozen lakes, rolling hills so pure and white,
A winter wonderland, waiting to be discovered, cherished in delight.
Winter, season of enchantment, slow down, and behold,
Appreciate beauty, cherish moments with loved ones to unfold.
It wraps us in its warm embrace, reminding us of life's magic spell,
Let us unwrap winter's magic, and let joy and wonder fill us well.

School life is a symphony of sounds**, a rhythmic beat of lockers slamming, chatter of friends, and the steady hum of lessons. It's a world where we grow, learn, and develop social skills, and create memories that last a lifetime. From the chaotic morning rush to the evening reflection, school life is a journey of self-discovery, where we form meaningful relationships, discover our strengths and weaknesses, and learn to navigate the ups and downs of this journey.

The school day begins with a chaotic symphony of alarm clocks, breakfast on-the-go, and a mad dash to catch the bus. As we burst through the school gates, the sounds of chatter and laughter fill the air, a cacophony of excitement and anticipation. School is where we form some of our most meaningful relationships, bond over shared interests, laughter, and adventures, and create memories that we'll cherish forever. Our friends are our support system, confidants, and partners in crime, and together, we navigate the ups and downs of school life, sharing our joys and sorrows. School is also about learning, growing, and developing new skills, where our teachers guide us, inspire us, and challenge us to reach our full potential.

As the school day comes to a close, we reflect on what we've learned, what we've accomplished, and what we could do better tomorrow. We think about our goals, our aspirations, and our dreams. School life is a journey of self-discovery, where we learn to navigate the ups and downs, and develop the resilience and determination to overcome obstacles. In conclusion, school life is a beautiful symphony of sounds, a rhythmic beat of lockers, lessons, and laughter. Let's remember to appreciate the little things, the moments that make us smile, and the lessons that shape us into the people we're meant to be.

If there's one thing I don't have enough of, it's time. And by that I mean time for all my projects, for everything that interests me, for everything I would like to learn. I love learning new things. Definitely a great skill and practically indispensable in my job as a software developer. But sometimes it's also a curse.
I always try to organize my time as well as I can. Sometimes it works more or less well.
I believe that this one thing is the reason why projects are not fulfilling, don't work or simply fall by the wayside.
Our brain can do many things, but one thing it cannot do. Multitasking. It is said that women are better at it than men. And that may be true. But it's still bad.
It is both a curse and a blessing. But this skill of doing one thing with everything you have is incredibly powerful. It may sound like a fortune cookie saying, but you really can do anything with it. It's a superpower.
One trap I often fall into is the fact that I believe that if I only do one thing, I have to do it perfectly. It has to be worth it, right? Bullshit.
I wrote this blog mainly for myself. Of course I hope to help others but I personally struggle with this issue every day.
Focus on one thing. Don't split your attention and energy. Bundle them. Quality over quantity!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of software development, designing a scalable and maintainable architecture is crucial for building a successful application. One approach to achieve this is by using containerization with Docker. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of using containerized Java microservices and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement this architecture.
Identify the microservices: Break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.
Choose a containerization platform: Select a suitable containerization platform, such as Docker, and install it on your development environment.
Create a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building and running your microservice.
Build and run the container: Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image and run the container.
Integrate with other services: Integrate the containerized microservice with other services in your application.
By following these steps, you can design a scalable and maintainable Java microservice architecture using containerization with Docker. For more information on containerized Java microservices, check out IAMDevBox.com.

Simply put, encryption at rest in Kubernetes refers to how the API server encrypts data before storing it in etcd. Think of etcd as the brain of your Kubernetes cluster - it's where all your cluster's configuration data, state, and secrets live.
By default, the Kubernetes API server stores resources in etcd as plain text. This means if someone gains unauthorized access to your etcd, they can read all your sensitive data, including secrets, without any effort. This is a significant security risk.
While encryption at rest applies to any Kubernetes resource, in this series, we'll continue to focus on Secrets …]]></summary>
