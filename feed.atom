In software engineering, many real-world problems boil down to tradeoffs, and one recurring decision is whether to query the database multiple times or fetch once and operate on data in memory. This seemingly small architectural choice can shape performance, reliability, and maintainability in ways that are easy to overlook but matter deeply in production.
One of the most fundamental and frequently encountered tradeoffs revolves around data access: when faced with needing multiple pieces of information about a single entity (like a user or an order), should we fetch everything once and perform checks in our application's memory, or should we make several targeted queries to the database, asking for specific…]]></summary>

According to Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the growing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies while remaining largely unregulated.
“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins and is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant further highlighted that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve spent the last few weeks organizing and refining my own incident response process for AWS.
From handling Security Hub alerts to writing custom SES and Slack notifications, I needed more than just a checklist — I needed an actual toolkit.
So I built one.
✅ A printable incident response checklist for triage
✅ An editable IR playbook aligned with ISO 27001 + AWS best practices
✅ Notification flows using EventBridge, SES, and Slack
✅ A cloud forensics tool matrix to guide acquisition and analysis
✅ Deployment-ready Terraform + Lambda code for alerting automation
After publishing my free IR checklist on my blog, I realized many teams (and individuals) still struggle with:
Rebuilding IR processes from scratch
Responding to findings without a clear comms path
Automating triage across teams or accounts
I bundled everything I use — templates, scripts, docs — into one focused toolkit.
When I started planning IR action plans this would have helped me a lot.
You can explore the full breakdown + story behind it here:
https://thehiddenport.dev/posts/aws-ir-toolkit/
And if you’re ready to grab it:
Download the AWS IR Toolkit on Gumroad (€9)
Includes all future updates, and a community where you can suggest changes.
💬 If you've built your own IR tools or want to share feedback — I'm all ears. This is version 1.0, and I plan to keep refining it.
Thanks for reading — and stay sharp out there.

The team behind the TRUMP memecoin has announced an exclusive gala dinner with former U.S. President Donald Trump, inviting the top 220 holders of the token.

I’m just starting out with Python and honestly, every little step feels like a big victory. I’ve been working through some beginner problems, and while they might look simple to many, for me they’re a huge deal — and I wanted to share what I’ve learned so far.
If you’re new to coding or struggling to get started, this is for you. Let’s celebrate the small wins together!
Here’s what I tackled recently:
Even or Odd Number Checker
I learned how to use if-else conditions and handle errors gracefully when the user enters something unexpected. It was my first lesson in writing friendly code that doesn’t just break.

Reverse a String Without Built-ins
No shortcuts here! I figured out how to reverse a string by looping through each character — it really made me think like a programmer.

Counting Vowels in a String
This taught me how to loop through strings and do checks. Also, I learned that converting characters to lowercase makes checking easier, which was a neat trick.

Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter
I applied a real-world formula and added input validation — so the program politely asks for valid numbers instead of crashing.

Word Count in a Sentence
A simple but powerful way to split strings into words and count them, opening the door to more text processing challenges.

Why This Matters
Every expert was once a beginner.
Small wins add up to big progress.
Writing code is as much about mindset as it is about syntax.
If you’re learning, don’t underestimate the power of these early steps. They build confidence and a solid foundation to tackle bigger challenges.
What’s Next?
Thanks for reading my story! 🙏
Happy coding! 💻✨]]></summary>

Semantic Versioning is a versioning system that uses a three-part number: major.minor.patch. Each segment has a specific purpose:
major: Incremented for incompatible API changes,
minor: Incremented for new features that are backward compatible, and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX estate, accusing the defunct crypto exchange of trying to deflect blame for its own failure.
Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.
Binance rejects this claim, stating that “…]]></summary>

According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that led to 45–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.
“Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post, adding:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty.
Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.
Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.
Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.

A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. 
Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. 
The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…]]></summary>

Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.
On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. 
In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.
She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.
In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange.
“The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantum Biopharma has purchased an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Canadian biotechnology company said. 
The buys take Quantum’s total cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a May 19 press release. The biotech company plans to stake a portion of its crypto to generate revenue. 
Quantum expects that holding a treasury of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets will “provide a return on investment for shareholders and […] provide some hedge against the Canadian dollar,” it said. 
Shares of Quantum’s stock, QNTM, rose by approximately 25% following the announcement, according to data from Google Finance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In one of his first speeches since becoming chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in April, Paul Atkins addressed some of the regulatory concerns around the cryptocurrency industry.
In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.
“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:

“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”

The Canary CRO Trust will hold the Cronos (CRO) token in a regulated fund wrapper, Crypto.com said, adding that the trust is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and is only available to accredited investors. 
Creating regulated funds such as CRO Trust is part of Crypto.com’s plan for “further mainstreaming crypto,” Eric Anziani, president and chief operating officer of Crypto.com, said in a statement.

Bitcoin’s rejection at $107,000 shows sellers are active at higher levels, but the recovery from the intraday low shows solid buying.

Strategy and Metaplanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin, adding steady buy-side pressure to BTC price. 

Select altcoins have pulled back, but they have not yet turned negative.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.
The short-term uncertainty has not deterred the long-term buyers from accumulating more Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, announced the purchase of 7,390 Bitcoin for an average price of about $103,500, taking its tot…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before discovering Bitcoin (BTC), Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo found success shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar as it rapidly lost value against the stronger US dollar. Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.
“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.
