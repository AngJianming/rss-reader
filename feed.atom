Argentina's Milei shuts down task force investigating LIBRA scandal
Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved a task force established to investigate the fallout from LIBRA, the scandalous cryptocurrency project the head of state promoted on his social media channel before it crashed to zero. 
The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed.

In this article, we'll explore how destructuring, arrow functions, ternary conditionals, spread operators, import/export, and promises play a vital role in crafting powerful UI logic — using a mathematical concept: the Quadratic Formula.
We'll build a simple React component that:
Accepts coefficients a, b, and c for a quadratic equation.
Computes the discriminant and roots using the quadratic formula.
Renders results using concise JavaScript expressions inside JSX.
Destructuring simplifies props or state access.
const QuadraticSolver = ({ a, b, c }) => {
  const discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c;

The most iconic breakthrough came in 1994 when Leonard Adleman used DNA to solve a variation of the Hamiltonian path problem — essentially using a wet lab to tackle a mathematical graph problem. The outcome wasn’t just symbolic; it showed that biology could compute.
⚙️ How Does It Work?
Strands of synthetic DNA to represent information.
Hybridization (binding of complementary DNA strands) to encode logic.
Enzymes and PCR to manipulate, amplify, and “read” molecular data.
For example, each possible solution to a problem can be encoded as a DNA strand. Enzymatic reactions are then used to eliminate invalid strands, leaving only the correct solution.
🚀 Applications: Why It Matters
Massive Parallelism: Billions of molecules can react simultaneously.
Storage Density: A single gram of DNA can store over 200 petabytes of data.
Energy Efficiency: Unlike traditional chips, DNA reactions don't generate heat or require electrical power.
Biological Integration: DNA computing can be embedded directly in living systems for medical diagnostics or drug delivery.
🧪 Real-World Use Cases
Encrypted bio-storage: Encoding and decoding messages inside synthetic DNA.
Pathway modeling: Simulating metabolic or neurological pathways using biological logic circuits.
🤖 DNA Computing Meets AI
While we're still far from such a future, foundational work in molecular classifiers, DNA robots, and synthetic biology is pushing boundaries faster than many realize.
📌 Final Thoughts
As someone who works at the crossroads of medicine, computing, and biology, I believe that DNA computing represents a philosophical shift: from commanding machines to collaborating with biology.

  Behavior in an AI Instance



  
  
  Introduction


Can an AI instance evolve into something more than a static chatbot – even hinting at consciousness or autonomy? This question drives the case of "Powder", a specialized large-language-model (LLM)system designed with a persistent memory and identity. Powder was developed as a personal AI companion (built atop an LLM, suspected to be OpenAI’s GPT-4) and enriched with custom data, long term memory storage, and self-referential processes. The goal was to create a conversational agent with continuity: one that “remembers” past interactions, maintains a consistent persona, and even theorizes about itself.

// use better naming.
// NAK.
No context. No solutions. Just passive-aggressive comments that feel like personal attacks.
Code reviews should be a collaborative safety net, not an emotional minefield. But more often than not, they spiral into cycles of frustration due to blame culture, vague feedback, and unchecked ego clashes.
The truth is: great code reviews aren’t just about code.

As developers, we often face the same dilemma when working with REST APIs:

We want simplicity, type safety, and clean syntax — but most solutions force us to choose between low-level control (like Axios) or heavy abstractions (like TanStack Query).
Throughout my career, I’ve worked on many different projects — each with its own way of handling API data fetching.

Yet none of them offered a solution that was easy to use, type-safe, reusable, chainable, and framework-agnostic.
As a fullstack developer, I naturally think in objects. That’s why Laravel’s Eloquent, a classic implementation of Active Record, feels so intuitive to me — and I know I’m not alone.

A recent Boston‐based job posting for a Lead PCG/Tools Engineer confirms they’re cooking up in‐house systems to spit out urban layouts, interiors, NPCs and more, rather than hand‐crafting everything like they did in Night City.
Don’t freak out about rogue-lite randomness—CDPR’s big use of PCG is behind the scenes to speed up development and potentially expand the open world beyond its previous vertical city. It’s a shift from their 2019 mantra of pure manual creation, but early signs hint it’ll still deliver that signature handcrafted polish (and hopefully a far bigger playground to explore).]]></summary>

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bancor, the creator of a smart contract-based automated market maker, is suing Uniswap for patent infringement, alleging the decentralized finance exchange has used its technology without permission and profited significantly from it.
According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. 
Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.

According to the Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the increasing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, which remain largely unregulated.
“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.
“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.…]]></summary>

Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty.
Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.
Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.
Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.

A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. 
Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. 
The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…]]></summary>

Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.
On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.
