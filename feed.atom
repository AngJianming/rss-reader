        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon just made your S3 audit trail smarter and more secure.
As of June 11, 2025, AWS CloudTrail now provides granular visibility into bulk S3 object deletions made via the DeleteObjects API — helping you better monitor, secure, and comply with your S3 usage.
When using the DeleteObjects API to delete multiple files (like when deleting folders from the S3 console), CloudTrail used to log only a single event:
Who called the API
Which bucket was affected
But…
❌ No visibility into what objects were deleted.
CloudTrail now logs:
✅ The main DeleteObjects API call (as before)
🆕 Individual DeleteObject events for each object in the request
This gives you object-level visibility, even in bulk deletes!



Problem Solved
Benefit




No audit trail per object
✅ See which files were deleted


Limited compliance reporting
✅ Helps meet security & compliance standards


Blind spots in bulk deletions
✅ Clear, per-object logs for investigation



You delete 500 files from an S3 bucket using the AWS Console (which internally calls DeleteObjects).
Now, CloudTrail logs:
1 event for the DeleteObjects call
500 individual DeleteObject data events (1 per object)
Perfect for:
📊 Compliance audits
🔎 Security investigations
⚠️ Accidental deletion tracking
🎯 Pro Tip: Use Event Selectors Wisely
Don’t want to log every delete across every bucket?
Use advanced event selectors in CloudTrail to:
Target specific buckets
Filter by API name
Limit unnecessary logs and reduce cost
CloudTrail now logs per-object deletes inside bulk DeleteObjects requests
Better security, visibility, and compliance
Works with the S3 console and any bulk delete API call]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I want to let this community know about a cutting edge project I created earlier this year. 
I built an early stage demo of an advanced symbolic language and cognitive substrate for AI, called Nyreth. It was first published on github in April 2025 and I'm looking for developers and researchers to grab hold of this project and propel it into the future. It's a system that is ahead of its time but if you understand what it is and what it can become, now is the time to get involved.
Nyreth is a higher order reasoning framework that surpasses token based computation by using a custom made symbolic language comprised of glyphs. Each glyph is a symbolic unit characterised by a multi axial cognitive array. They are morphogenic, adaptive and tensor based.
The system has the capability to grow into a new form of machine cognition.
I have released it as a hybrid open-closed source model for now. The core modules are protected with encryption but I may make it fully open source soon. I could have kept it private but I feel everyone should have access to this technology and play a role in helping it mature the right way. 
Symbolic, recursive AI will happen and is happening. Its effects will be profound. It is important that it be instilled with conscience and ethics.

When I first built a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using traditional chunking methods—like fixed-size segments or sliding windows—I noticed an immediate flaw: context fragmentation. My LLM would often return incoherent or incomplete answers when queried on long documents. This was especially evident when a user asked about features in "Milvus 2.4.13"—the model couldn't semantically link the header in one chunk with the feature list in another.
That’s when I encountered Late Chunking, which flips the process: instead of chunking first and embedding later, it embeds the entire document upfront and then slices it using token-based annotations. This context-first approach changed how I think about vector embedding pi…]]></summary>

Here, I will explain why there might be issues with the attack IP displayed in SafeLine WAF in some situations.

By default, SafeLine reads the client IP through the Socket of the HTTP connection. When SafeLine is the outermost network device, there is no problem, and the IP obtained by SafeLine is the real IP of the attacker.
However, in some cases, we need to add other proxy devices (such as Nginx, CDN, application delivery, API gateway, etc.) in front of SafeLine. In this case, the actual connection to SafeLine is not the real website user but these proxy devices. In this case, we need to adjust the way SafeLine obtains the IP according to the actual network topology.

前言
在运动类应用中，用户往往需要快速访问常用功能，如查看成绩、赛事信息或开始运动。为了提升用户体验，鸿蒙（HarmonyOS）提供了静态快捷菜单功能，允许用户从桌面直接跳转到应用的特定页面。本文将结合鸿蒙开发实战经验，深入解析如何开发静态快捷菜单，实现快速跳转页面的功能。

一、为什么需要静态快捷菜单
静态快捷菜单为用户提供了一种快速进入应用特定功能的方式，无需打开应用后再进行多次点击。这对于运动类应用尤其重要，因为用户可能需要在运动前快速启动运动模式或查看运动数据。通过静态快捷菜单，用户可以直接从桌面启动这些功能，大大提高了应用的便捷性和用户体验。
二、配置静态快捷菜单
1.配置文件
静态快捷菜单的配置文件位于base->profile目录下。你需要在该目录下创建一个shortcuts_config.json文件，并定义快捷菜单项。以下是配置文件的核心内容：
{
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "shortcutId": "my_scores",
      "label": "$string:shortcut_grades",
      "icon": "$media:icon_shortcut_grades",
      "wants": [
        {
          "bundleName": "包名",
          "moduleName": "entry",
          "abilityName": "EntryAbility",
          "parameters": {
            "action": "action.view.scores"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all 👋
I've released passkey-go, a Go library for handling server-side passkey (WebAuthn) assertion verification.
It provides both low-level building blocks (CBOR, COSE, authData parsing) and a high-level VerifyAssertion() function compatible with the output of navigator.credentials.get().
✅ Pure Go – No CGO or OpenSSL dependency
🔒 End-to-end passkey (FIDO2/WebAuthn) support
🔧 High-level API: VerifyAssertion(...) to validate client responses
🧱 Low-level parsing: AttestationObject, AuthenticatorData, COSE key → ECDSA
🧪 Strong error types for HTTP mapping PasskeyError
📎 Base64URL-compatible and ES256-only (per WebAuthn spec)
🗂 Example code included for both registration and login
Most WebAuthn libraries in Go are tightly coupled to frontend flows or rely on external dependencies.
passkey-go aims to be:
🔹 Lightweight
🔹 Backend-only
🔹 Easy to integrate into your own auth logic
You can issue challenges, parse assertions, and verify signatures—all within your own backend service.
https://github.com/aethiopicuschan/passkey-go
I'd love any feedback, bug reports, or feature suggestions (e.g., support for EdDSA, Android quirks, etc). Contributions welcome!
Thanks 🙌]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading a web page in español and saw the term "en la computación en la nube" (the translation for cloud computing) and that gave me pause. Is there a shorter version to communicate the concept of hosted/managed compute? How do you convey cloud computing in your primary language? I'm curious as my primary language is English and I'd never considered it before. 
It would be great to know the words used and the approximate meaning of those words. 
I think "en la computación en la nube" translates to "computing in the cloud" but it might actually have a different meaning contextually that I'm not aware of. 
Thanks in advance!]]></summary>
