        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance-affiliated BNB Chain has rebounded after a period of stagnation in 2023 amid accelerating institutional and decentralized finance (DeFi) adoption. 
During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward. 
“This resilience isn't just about price action — strong fundamentals also back it,” Joao Wedson, CEO of investing analytics platform Alphractal, said in an April X post. “Binance has built a massive ecosyste…]]></summary>

In a startup, your survival depends on how quickly you can iterate, ship features, and deliver value to end-users. This is where the foundational architecture of your startup plays a big role; additionally, things like your tech stack and choice of programming language directly affect your team’s velocity. The wrong architecture, especially premature microservices, can substantially hurt productivity and contribute to missed goals in delivering software.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[^ in Object Initializers


The ^ operator (read as "from the end") has been part of C# since version 8, allowing developers to easily access elements from the end of collections:
int last = myArray[^1]; // Last element

However, until C# 13, you couldn’t use ^ inside object initializers. This restriction has now been lifted, giving developers more expressive and compact ways to initialize collections directly.
Let’s explore how this change improves array initialization syntax and simplifies common patterns.
Prior to C# 13:
var countdown = new TimerRemaining();
countdown.buffer[^1] = 0; // Valid

But you could not write:
var countdown = new TimerRemaining
{
    buffer = { [^1] = 0 } // ❌ Compiler error before C# 13
};

Now, this syntax is fully supported.

Passing methods as delegates

C# 13+ introduces an important enhancement in how the compiler handles these method groups by optimizing the resolution of a natural type (i.e., an expected delegate type) for a method group.
Let’s explore what changed, how it affects overload resolution, and what it means for you as a C# expert.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When setting up a golden master test case in PHP, developers often encounter challenges due to unexpected differences stemming from side-effects. For example, in a scenario where certain strings may be altered at known places, it can lead to assertion failures when using PHPUnit's assertSame() method. The good news is that it's possible to filter out specific differences to allow for successful test case execution.
Understanding the Issue
When running tests in PHPUnit, the assertSame($expected, $actual) method checks whether two variables reference the same value. Consequently, if there are slight variations in the strings (like those introduced by side-effects), the assertion will fail, leading developers to question how they can manage expected differences effectively.

Solution:
Example src/test/resources/application.properties:
properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

Check Active Profiles: The logs mention that no profiles are currently active. If database settings are tied to a specific profile, activate it during testing. You can do this by adding the spring.profiles.active property.
Example:
properties
spring.profiles.active=test

Add H2 Dependency (If Using Embedded Database): If H2 is used as the test database, add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Adjust Workflow Configuration: Modify the workflow file to ensure that the correct profile or configuration is used during tests. Update the Run tests step in .github/workflows/backend-ci.yml:
YAML
- name: Run tests
  run: mvn test --no-transfer-progress -Dspring.profiles.active=test

Verify Test Class Annotations: Ensure that the FutureSeedBackendApplicationTests class is annotated correctly to load the appropriate context for testing. For example:
Java
@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test") // Ensure the 'test' profile is active
public class FutureSeedBackendApplicationTests {
}

Next Steps:
Implement the changes above.
Re-run the workflow to verify that the issue is resolved.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.
Source: Ethereum.org
EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.
Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially signif…]]></summary>

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.
