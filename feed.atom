Assim como arquitetos de software precisam entender sobre segurança, nós também precisamos conhecer sobre desenvolvimento seguro. Se esse conceito é novo para você e você trabalha com desenvolvimento web, recomendo começar pelo OWASP Top 10.
Mas a segurança vai além disso! Também existem outras referências importantes, como:
CWE e CWE Top 25 - Lista de fraquezas comuns de segurança em software.
CERT - Diretrizes para programação segura em diferentes linguagens.
CVE - Base de dados de vulnerabilidades conhecidas em produtos e softwares específicos.
Nesta fase, colocamos a segurança em prática através de código seguro e ferramentas automatizadas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dica de TI será uma série de posts com conteúdo sobre tecnologia. São posts curtos explicando alguns conceitos.
Nos exemplos a linguagem usada será: Java
Além dos operadores citados anteriormente, o operador de incremento é usado para aumentar o valor de uma variável em 1. Existem dois tipos de operadores de incremento: o operador de pré-incremento (++variavel) e o operador de pós-incremento (variavel++).
O operador de pré-incremento (++variavel) aumenta o valor da variável em 1 antes de usar a variável em uma expressão. Aqui está um exemplo:
int num = 5;
int resultado = ++num; //num é incrementado para 6 e depois atribuído a resultado
System.out.println(num); // imprime 6
System.out.println(resultado); // imprime 6

Já o operador de pós-incremento (variavel++) aumenta o valor da variável em 1 depois de usar a variável em uma expressão. Aqui está um exemplo:
int num = 5;
int resultado = num++; //num é atribuído primeiramente à variável resultado e depois incrementado para 6
System.out.println(num); // imprime 6
System.out.println(resultado); // imprime 5]]></summary>

Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.
The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nessa fase, são definidos os requisitos de segurança, funcionais e não funcionais, como as regras que devem ser seguidas, incluindo normas como a LGPD. Além disso, as decisões tomadas aqui influenciam diretamente a arquitetura e o design do sistema, garantindo que a segurança seja considerada desde a estruturação inicial.
Algumas perguntas importantes a serem respondidas incluem:
Qual é a classificação dos dados de acordo com as políticas da empresa? Isso inclui dados pessoais e sensíveis, e deve ser especificado como cada tipo de dado será tratado.
Quem terá acesso aos dados? Detalhar quem tem permissão para visualizar, alterar ou excluir os dados, com base nas políticas de controle de acesso.
Políticas de Exclusão: Devemos definir e documentar políticas claras para a exclusão de dados, incluindo como e quando os dados devem ser removidos.
Por exemplo, no nosso sistema, temos dados pessoais e acadêmicos das alunas. Quem terá permissão para ver esses dados? Quem pode alterá-los? Quais são as políticas de exclusão aplicadas?

Na imagem, podemos ver que a aluna possui dados pessoais (nome, CPF, endereço, data de nascimento) e dados acadêmicos (notas, RA, frequência e histórico escolar).
Nota Importante:
Dados pessoais: são aqueles que permitem a identificação direta ou indireta de uma pessoa.
Voltando ao exemplo, a aluna tem acesso apenas aos seus próprios dados(pessoais e acadêmicos), enquanto a professora tem acesso de visualização e também de edição apenas aos dados acadêmicos de suas alunas, podendo, por exemplo, alterar notas ou incluir justificativas para faltas. Já a administradora tem acesso a todos os dados pessoais, acadêmicos e administrativos de todos os usuários.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Para começarmos a entender o que é SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle), trouxe uma analogia para vocês. Eu sempre penso em como explicaria algo novo para a minha avó. Então, vamos à analogia e depois à explicação com exemplos.

Análise de Requisitos (Planejamento):  Nesta fase, você identifica os materiais e requisitos legais necessários para construir a casa, como consultar a prefeitura sobre regras e normas de construção.
Arquitetura e Design: Você desenha a planta da casa, escolhendo materiais, planejando entradas e saídas, e definindo medidas de segurança, como alarme e fechaduras.
Implementação: A casa começa a ser construída. Você percebe que, além do alarme, precisa adicionar câmeras para garantir mais segurança.
Testes: Antes de entregar a casa, a equipe testa o funcionamento das instalações, como eletricidade, alarmes e janelas. Verifica se tudo está em ordem.
Implantação: Antes de entregar a casa aos proprietários, engenheiros fazem uma análise para garantir que tudo foi construído corretamente. Se estiver tudo certo, a casa é entregue.
Manutenção: A casa está funcionando, mas você precisa fazer manutenções regulares. O alarme ou câmeras podem precisar de atualizações ou trocas devido a falhas descobertas.
Bom, agora vamos ao SSDLC :)
Como vimos na analogia o SSDLC pode ser considerado uma construção de uma casa, com um Lego, onde cada fase do processo de desenvolvimento de software seguro é uma peça importante que, quando combinada com as outras, forma um software seguro.
Ou seja, devemos pensar em segurança desde o início, já no planejamento, e não apenas a partir da codificação. A segurança deve estar presente em todas as fases do ciclo de desenvolvimento.
Agora, vamos entender como funciona cada fase desse ciclo.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pensando em segurança no desenvolvimento de software, onde geralmente a incluímos? Como pessoa desenvolvedora, posso pensar na fase de codificação, testes e implementação. Mas, se pensarmos um pouco antes, será que o início do desenvolvimento do software é na codificação? Não, sabemos que a codificação não é o começo. Então, por que não pensar e incluir segurança desde o início?

SQL Injection teve sua primeira identificação em 1998. Fonte: https://phrack.org/issues/54/8.html

Exemplo de report SQL Injection de julho de 2024. Fonte: https://hackerone.com/reports/2597543
Para responder a essas questões, vamos entender como funciona SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle) e como ele pode ser aplicado tanto em novos projetos quanto em softwares em desenvolvimento.

No exemplo, temos uma página de login com os campos "username" e "password". Um agente mal-intencionado (a ameaça) deseja acessar o sistema para obter dados ou privilégios que ele não deveria ter. Ele pode tentar explorar brechas de segurança conhecidas. Quando ele encontra uma falha de segurança por exemplo no login (a vulnerabilidade), ele explora essa falha.
Se o agente consegue acessar o sistema, o risco não é só o ato de acessar o sistema em si, mas sim a possibilidade de que a ameaça explore a vulnerabilidade e cause um impacto negativo, como roubo de dados, comprometimento do sistema, ou controle total, especialmente se ele conseguir fazer login como administrador. O risco acontece quando uma vulnerabilidade é explorada, e o impacto desse risco varia conforme o tipo de acesso obtido (por exemplo, um login de administrador representa um risco maior para a empresa).
A vulnerabilidade é o ponto fraco que pode ser explorado por uma ameaça, resultando em risco de danos ao sistema.]]></summary>

On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.

“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX estate, accusing the defunct crypto exchange of trying to deflect blame for its own failure.
Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.
Binance rejects this claim, stating that “…]]></summary>

According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.
“Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post, adding:

Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.
Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.
Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.

A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. 
Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. 
The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…]]></summary>

Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.
On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.
She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.
In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update (May 20, 3:17 am UTC): This article has been updated to add statements from senators and information on the GENIUS Act.
The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it’s a “…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.

If Ripple or Coinbase were to buy Circle, the details of a purchase would differ. Ripple would pay using cash and XRP (XRP), a cryptocurrency that Ripple created. Coinbase, on the other hand, would use cash and stock.
