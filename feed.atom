Setting up observability from scratch can be complex, so leveraging a ready-made, realistic example can significantly speed up the learning process. The official OpenTelemetry "Astronomy Shop" demo is designed precisely for this – it's much more than just a sample application.
Think of it as a pre-instrumented, multi-service online store built specifically to help us explore how distributed systems tick (and sometimes break!). It lets you see firsthand how tools like OpenTelemetry can help track down performance bottlenecks or tricky errors in a microservices setup.

When designing applications in C#, we sometimes need to ensure that a class behaves in a global or shared way — whether that means only one instance exists, or that all instances share the same state.
Two popular design patterns for this are the Singleton and the Monostate. They might seem similar at first, but they’re actually quite different under the hood. Let’s explore both using a story you’ll never forget.

What happens when you combine real-time news, generative AI, and modern art?
You get Unjica — a living, breathing editorial that curates and reimagines contemporary art stories using OpenAI and custom code.
As a developer and art enthusiast, I wanted to create something that:
Keeps up with the fast-moving world of art and exhibitions,
Feels editorial (not robotic),
Looks beautiful, like a curated magazine,
And updates itself — daily.
Next.js + App Router: for structure and speed


Prisma + PostgreSQL: to store and filter news


OpenAI (GPT-4o & DALL·E 3): to generate articles and header images


R2 Storage: to persist DALL·E outputs


Scheduled CRON jobs on Vercel: for daily automation


Markdown content: clean, simple, structured




  
  
  ✨ What Makes It Interesting



Articles sound like real human writers — critical, witty, even poetic.

Visuals are generated with painterly prompts (no generic AI mush).

It's self-sustaining — I just keep refining it.
Here's a recent post to give you a taste.
Tuning prompts to avoid generic AI tone

Balancing automation with taste

Making SEO work with dynamic Open Graph images




  
  
  🚀 What’s Next?



Integrating artist interviews

Letting users vote on which stories should be featured

Adding human + AI collaboration tools



Would love your thoughts — or any feedback on how to make it more useful for creators or art lovers.

Why?
Accept a pattern
Read a file or stdin
Print lines that contain the pattern
No regex engine. No flags. 
#include <stdio.h>      // Allows us to read files and print to the screen
#include <string.h>     // Gives us string functions like strstr()

#define MAX_LINE 1024   // Max characters we’ll read per line

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {

🧠 Bonus Tip: What’s with the ≠ Symbol? (for the YT video)

At one point in my editor, != was shown as ≠. A few folks asked if ≠ is valid C.

Sometimes, reducing things to their bare bones gives us a deeper appreciation of how they work.
If you're just getting back into C or want to build your own tiny utilities, this is a great place to start.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[앞서 RDMA에 대한 글을 적으며, 한 가지 '지연(latency)'에 대한 용어에 대해 좀 더 상세히 설명해야겠다는 생각이 들었다.
왜냐하면, 지연(latency)이란 데이터가 한 지점에서 다른 지점으로 이동하는 데 걸리는 시간을 말한다. 다시 말해, 네트워크나 시스템에서 요청(Request)이 전송된 순간부터 응답(Response)을 받을 때까지 걸리는 시간이다.
1. 네트워크에서 지연시간 
데이터 패킷이 출발지에서 목적지까지 도달하는 데 걸리는 시간
예) 사용자가 웹사이트를 클릭했을 때, 웹페이지가 로드될 때까지 걸리는 시간
주요 원인:
1) 거리(Distance) → 데이터가 먼 거리까지 이동할수록 지연 증가
2) 라우팅(Routing) → 데이터가 여러 네트워크 장치를 거치면 지연 증가
3) 네트워크 혼잡(Congestion) → 트래픽이 많을수록 패킷이 지연됨
4) 대역폭 제한(Bandwidth Limit) → 낮은 대역폭에서는 데이터 전송 속도가 느려짐



지연 시간 요인
설명




전파 지연 (Propagation Delay)
신호가 물리적인 전송 매체(예: 광케이블, 구리선)를 따라 이동하는 데 걸리는 시간 (거리 영향)


전송 지연 (Transmission Delay)
데이터가 송신 측에서 네트워크를 통해 전송되는 데 걸리는 시간 (패킷 크기 및 대역폭 영향)


처리 지연 (Processing Delay)
라우터나 스위치에서 패킷을 수신하고 검사하며 적절한 경로로 전달하기 위한 처리 시간


큐잉 지연 (Queuing Delay)
네트워크 장비에서 처리 대기 중인 패킷이 대기열에 쌓이면서 발생하는 시간 (혼잡도 영향)



2. 컴퓨터 시스템에서 지연시간
CPU, 메모리, 스토리지, 네트워크 간 데이터 이동 속도 차이로 인해 발생하는 지연


주요 원인:



3. 데이터센터 & AI 환경에서의 지연시간
 분산 학습(Distributed Training) 및 RDMA 네트워크에서 매우 중요한 요소 - GPU 간 데이터 교환 속도 좌우 
예) 256개의 GPU가 동시에 데이터를 교환할 때 레이턴시가 높으면 전체 AI 학습 속도가 크게 저하됨


주요 원인:


지연시간 최적화 방법



4. 지연시간을 줄이는 방법
1) 일반 네트워크에서의 최적화
5. 결론
지연은 AI 및 데이터센터에서 가장 중요한 요소 중 하나 -> 네트워크 및 시스템 성능을 결정하는 핵심 지표
AI 및 HPC 환경에서는 낮은 저지연(low latency)가 필수ㄹ
네트워크 설계(Network Topology), RDMA 기술, 케이블 배선 최적화를 통해 최소화해야 함]]></summary>

In concurrent programming, especially when dealing with threads, managing shared resources safely is crucial. In C, semaphores are often used to control access to shared resources to prevent conflicts. Here, we have a scenario where multiple threads are trying to fill a bucket one cup at a time, and we need to ensure that only one thread can fill the bucket at any given moment. To achieve this, we will use the sem_wait() and sem_post() functions.
Understanding the Code
Before we dive into the solution, let’s take a closer look at the provided code fragment:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
#include <pthread.h>

sem_t s;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era where digital privacy is under constant threat, relying solely on third-party infrastructure — even from trusted providers — isn’t always enough. That’s why I decided to self-host the Signal messaging service, giving me complete control over my communication environment and infrastructure.
Signal is widely known for its end-to-end encrypted messaging. But hosting your own Signal server takes privacy even further:
🚫 No third-party data exposure

👁️‍🗨️ Full transparency of the system
🏢 Private internal messaging for teams or organizations
🔐 Complete control over infrastructure and data
Whether you're a developer, privacy advocate, or a business, self-hosting Signal empowers you with full ownership of your messaging environment.
Here’s a quick look at the tech stack I used:
🐳 Docker & Docker Compose


💻 Ubuntu VPS


🌐 NGINX + Let’s Encrypt


🔐 Custom Domain + DNS Configuration


☁️ Cloud Providers
AWS, GCP, Azure, and Cloudflare for advanced DNS, firewall, or load balancing.







  
  
  🧠 Final Thoughts


Self-hosting Signal isn’t just a tech experiment — it’s a strategic move toward digital independence.
With today’s DevOps tooling and open-source software, deploying your own private Signal server is more feasible than ever.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 
If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core developers have decided to remove a limit on transaction data in the next network upgrade, enabling more data to be included in a more efficient way. 
“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) John Durham has departed as President Donald Trump’s pick takes control of the office.
In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…]]></summary>

In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. 
“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”
The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finz…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.
