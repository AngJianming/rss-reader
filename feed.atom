At first glance, it looks like madness - mushrooms on the orbit, banana art, tigers in Lambos. Crypto's wealthiest often seem to turn spreadsheets into spectacle - burning millions on stunts that feel more absurd than strategic.
But what if that chaos is the clue? Maybe how they spend their wealth says more about how they earned it - and how they think. And maybe, just maybe, the ability to reprogram markets... comes with the urge to reprogram reality, too.
🛰 $55M to orbit the Earth’s poles (and grow mushrooms)

💰 A $2M treasure hunt - buried across the U.S.

🍌 The banana that became a $5M media weapon
Yes. Strategic? Absolutely!

🦍 The James Bond of crypto… or Ace Ventura?

🪐 From Mars to Mercury (Freddie's, not the planet)

So what are we really looking at?
rare thinking that made these people billionaires: a comfort with risk, a hunger for attention, and a willingness to break the script entirely - in business and in life.
So the real question isn't "why did they buy that?", it is: 
How wild do your ideas need to be... to be worth millions?

I’m excited to say we’re nearly done!
Over the past few weeks, our team has been polishing the app — fixing bugs, refining the user experience, and preparing for launch. The backend and database will be hosted soon, making the platform live and accessible.
Looking Back at the Tech Stack:
Backend: PHP Laravel — my internship experience gave me a strong foundation here, and I’ve deepened my understanding of scalable architecture, API development, and ORM relationships.
Frontend: React — my teammate has built a clean, responsive UI that complements the functionality we’ve worked hard to develop on the backend, resulting in a seamless user experience across the platform.
Database: MySQL — we designed the schema to handle complex relationships efficiently, especially for managing users, food listings, and organization profiles.
This project has been both technically and personally rewarding. We’ve approached it like a real-world product, learning through every challenge.
What’s Next:
Deploying the backend and database online
Final usability testing
Gathering feedback for improvements
If you’ve worked on something similar or have any tips for hosting and scaling Laravel apps, I’d love to connect and learn from your experience.
Thanks for following along — more updates soon!]]></summary>

In traditional software development, when something breaks, you look at the logs. You dig into the stack trace, inspect variables, step through the debugger, isolate the bug.
In AI-powered applications, that world is gone.
When an LLM fails, there’s often no crash, no error, and no stack trace. Just a subtly wrong response. A hallucination. A weird behavior that’s technically correct but totally wrong for your user.
Debugging becomes conversational. And that changes everything.
In our product Linkeme, we rely on prompts to:
Generate social media content
Choose relevant CTAs
Compose visual overlays
And yet, some of the most frustrating bugs we faced early on didn’t come from bad code — but from poorly constructed prompts.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recipe first


Avoid using ObjectId Type for Ambiguous Typing System Across Tiers by favoring Strings instead. This will result in simpler backend types and DTOs that are reusable at the front end without requiring any special tools. The main disadvantage of this approach is a slight decrease in performance, as strings are larger than ObjectIds and can impact fast sorting operations.
This scenario originated from a real application. It seems we followed the basic rules in different steps but ultimately failed. It would be great if we had changed the architecture at the start. Our application has a stack consisting of NestJS, Angular, and Mongoose, all written in TypeScript.
We successfully implemented reusing typings across tiers, but it appeared complicated. Each tier had its own typing system, which could have been optimized. A clue to the problem is that the type of the primary field _id is ObjectId, a complex type present only on the backend. This made it unnatural for it to be used on both the frontend and backend.
Some tools were implemented to reuse these types on ObjectId. New UI types were created, which seemed to improve the application's typing system. However, the application became convoluted, and we didn't want to research the case of using plain string IDs because we thought our approach was correct and it worked everywhere except for MeteorJS projects.
If we refused to use the ObjectId type, we could eliminate the need for these tools, new UI types, and even DTOs that work on both frontend and backend. To test this idea, we created a separate project where I implemented the concept. The only disadvantage is the potential impact on MongoDB performance, which I couldn't measure.
Additionally, we experimented with meaningful primary IDs where demanded custom solutions where string type is demanded.]]></summary>

PostgreSQL 18 introduces a significant enhancement under the hood with its new asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem. According to the official release notes, this feature is designed to increase I/O throughput and to hide I/O latency. It can be enabled via the io_method server variable. For Linux users, this means io_uring can be leveraged, while a worker-based implementation is available for all platforms. The initial implementation focuses on file system reads, including sequential scans, bitmap heap scans, and vacuums.

📂 JavaScript’s File API - to extract and stream file content using the JS File Reader API

⚙️ Frontend logic that bridges both - code snippets, UX tips, and more
You’ll learn how to build a seamless experience where your app can take an uploaded file, process its contents, and produce smart, contextual responses — all inside the browser.

A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. 
Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. 
The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…]]></summary>

On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.
As per the complaint, Genesis creditors are still owed around $2.2 billion worth of…]]></summary>

In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance has asked a US federal judge to send all members of a class-action lawsuit alleging it sold securities to arbitration, arguing that the group waived their ability to form a class action under the company’s terms.
The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange.
“The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it’s a “…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

The buys take Quantum’s total cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a May 19 press release. The biotech company plans to stake a portion of its crypto to generate revenue. 
Quantum expects that holding a treasury of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets will “provide a return on investment for shareholders and […] provide some hedge against the Canadian dollar,” it said. 
Shares of Quantum’s stock, QNTM, rose by approximately 25% following the announcement, according to data from Google Finance.

In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.
“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:

“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”

Select altcoins have pulled back, but they have not yet turned negative.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.
“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.

Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.

Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.

Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply clus…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price fell 1.4% to $102,460 amid US economic concerns, with daily trading volume up 94%, indicating the return of sellers.

Moody’s US credit downgrade to Aa1 and a class-action lawsuit against Strategy add to BTC’s headwinds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by over 1.4% over the last 24 hours to $102,460 as concerns over the health of the US economy sour investor sentiment. Its daily trading volume has jumped by 94% to $66.6 billion, suggesting that the sell-side activity is intensifying.

Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.
Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.
Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.
