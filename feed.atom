        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s digital world, users expect fast, responsive, and reliable web experiences. One of the most effective ways to meet these expectations is through caching. In frontend development, caching reduces load times, decreases server strain, and improves overall performance — but only when done right.
This article explores what caching is, the different types used in frontend development, and how you can implement them effectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last article, I introduced the try-catch IIFE pattern. Some of you found it clever, while others couldn’t stand the syntax. And honestly? Fair. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) can look odd at first glance.
But I’m here to change your mind.
IIFE isn’t just a relic of the var era, there are still many modern use cases.
Here are 7 modern use cases of IIFE that go beyond legacy code and show how they can improve clarity, encapsulation, and expressiveness in your everyday code.

Before we look at modern use cases, let’s rewind a bit.
IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. It's a function that runs right after it’s defined. Like this:
(() => {
  console.log("Hello!");
})();

You define a function and immediately invoke it. But why go through thi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[❗ Avoid .Wait() and .Result in Async Contexts – Here’s Why


Calling .Wait() or .Result on a Task blocks the current thread until the Task completes.
🧠 Why?
The result:
Deadlock.
public class DeadlockDemo
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting...");
        var result = GetData().Result; // ❌ This can deadlock in UI/ASP.NET
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    }

    public static async Task<string> GetData()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async work
        return "Hello from async!";
    }
}


What happens?
public class AsyncSafeDemo
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Starting...");
        var result = await GetData(); // ✅ Safe and non-blocking
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    }

    public static async Task<string> GetData()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulate async work
        return "Hello from async!";
    }
}

Why this works:
❌ Avoid .Result or .Wait() in async contexts (can cause deadlocks).
✅ Use await to keep things async and non-blocking.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: We can test for equality, less-than and greater-than by using a combination of calc(), abs() and sign().
Others, such as Lea Verou, have written superb guides about using binary logic to perform conditions in CSS, using CSS Variables with values of 0 or 1.
Until CSS supports @if and @else then we have to make do with such workarounds.
Often however, we have numbers other than 0 or 1 in our CSS Variables so it would be handy if we could compare numeric values and drive logic from them.
In JS we might simply write:

  if (a === b) {
    // Apply some styles
  }

  if (a > b) {
    // Apply some styles
  }

but the best we could hope for in CSS right now is to set boolean variables like the following, and to use them in Binary Linear Interpolation:
  --isEqual:       /* Some magical logic here */
  --isGreaterThan: /* Some other magical logic */

Well there is a way, using calc() and the more recent abs() and sign().
Like this...
    --isNotEqual:    sign(abs(calc(var(--a) - var(--b))));
    --isEqual:                calc(1 - var(--isNotEqual));

    --isLessThan:    sign(max(0, calc(var(--b) - var(--a))));
    --isGreaterThan: sign(max(0, calc(var(--a) - var(--b))));

    --isLessThanOrEqual:         calc(1 - var(--isGreaterThan));
    --isGreaterThanOrEqual:      calc(1 - var(--isLessThan));

    /* I'd welcome any suggestions for smarter ways to derive these! */

Demo on CodePen.
Note: abs() and sign() have only partial browser support but they can be achieved using older syntax. At time of writing only Safari & Firefox supported them.]]></summary>

I’m Jose, a .NET backend & DevOps engineer on a mission to forge purposeful solutions—not just code and configs, but the clear reasons behind each decision. After a year of deep dives into cloud architecture, containerization, and front-end wizardry (Angular 18 + TypeScript, I see you!), I’m finally sharing my experiments in real time.

Pipeline Playground: GitHub Actions → Docker → AWS Elastic Beanstalk (and yes, I’ll show you how to tame that YAML monster).


Frontend Fun: Angular 18 UI that drinks from my API’s firehose—spoiler: caching matters!
I’m all about demystifying the “magic” of DevOps and API design. Expect:
Deep-dive posts on performance tweaks, security hardening, and real-world trade-offs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared
For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…]]></summary>

Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. 
Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.…]]></summary>

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $4,000.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish
Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s (ETH) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6.

On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.
Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…]]></summary>

Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals. It follows Genius Group being temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order had banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more BTC.
Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.
Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips.

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks
This is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significa…]]></summary>

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.
