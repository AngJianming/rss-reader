If you’ve just installed Ubuntu (or any Linux distro) and found yourself wondering, “Where are all the apps?”, this post is for you.
When I first dipped into Linux, I thought I’d have to give up the convenience of familiar tools like Word, Photoshop, or iTunes. But Ubuntu surprised me — it’s packed with open-source software that works just as well (sometimes even better).
Let me break it down for you 👇
Most of the tools you’ll use on Ubuntu are open-source. That means:
They’re free ✅
You can inspect the code ✅
You can tweak or contribute if you want ✅
But more importantly for us as users: you’ll find a Linux alternative for almost every app you’re used to on Windows or macOS.
Let’s explore some of them:

Have you ever been at a social gathering and introduced yourself as a cloud engineer, or answered the classic question, "What do you do?", only to be met with puzzled looks and the inevitable follow-up:

"What do cloud engineers actually do?"
You're not alone. Many people are curious about the cloud and what cloud engineers really do.
In simple terms, cloud computing is like renting a super-powerful computer over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, businesses use resources provided by cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

But what does a cloud engineer do in this vast digital world? Let’s break it down step by step.

Before diving into the web evolution, here's a fun fact: the internet was born from Cold War paranoia!
In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA created ARPANET — a communication network designed to survive nuclear attacks. The irony? What started as a military defense system became the foundation for cat videos and memes.
💡 Did you know? The first ARPANET message was sent on October 29, 1969, between UCLA and Stanford. It was supposed to say "LOGIN" but crashed after "LO" — technically making the first internet message failed attempt!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While DEV.to is typically a space for backend architecture and performance optimization, this discussion bridges that world with another deeply technical arena: algorithmic trading. Specifically, we’re talking about latency—the type that separates profitable execution from missed opportunity.
Whether you're writing trading bots, building dashboards, consuming exchange APIs, or handling transaction relays, this is a backend performance layer you cannot ignore.
In trading, timing is execution. The difference between spotting an arbitrage opportunity and capturing it often comes down to milliseconds.
A system can detect a price inefficiency across platforms, but if your transaction arrives a fraction of a second after someone else’s, it’s irrelevant. First arrival wins. Everyone else provides…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PostgreSQL limits tuple sizes to a quarter of the block size, generally capping at 2KB. In document data modeling, where documents represent business transactions, sizes often exceed this limit. Storing entire transaction documents as a single JSONB can lead to compression and splitting via TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique). While this is suitable for static documents that are infrequently accessed, it is less optimal for queries on documents. Let's take an example to detect this issue.
I create a user profile table similar to the previous post, but adding a bio field with large text:

create table users (
  id bigserial primary key,

They want tools that work. In 2025, that means choosing tools that cut noise, centralize communication, and sync with code.
Remote teams live in different time zones. They use Slack, GitHub, and Google Docs. They code during sprints and debug on-call. When teams don’t share office space, traditional tools fall short. What works in a conference room breaks on Zoom.
Developers need:
Clear task visibility
Fast, async communication
Source control integration
Lightweight documentation
Minimal context switching
Tools that miss these points? Dead weight.

What else might pop up?

Sony could flash external titles it’s publishing (think Phantom Blade Zero) or surprises from other global partners. In short: trailers, announcements and a deep dive into the PS5’s must-watch lineup.]]></summary>
