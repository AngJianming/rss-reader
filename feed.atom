        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my recent post on how to convert any git repo into llm readable format, there is an use case for this and that is feed it into a llm to chat.
I have just added the chat feature, check out the github repo.
You can also directly deploy it on railway: one click deploy
This post will be explain the features of the chat and how to use it, the code is more interesting than this post to be honest, so make sure to check out the github link.
Here's the summary on how it works:
Clone the repo
parse all files (ignore some like .git folder)
ask gemini/mistral-ocr to parse special files like images and pdfs
convert them into llm readable format like markdown
Now we have the text version of the repo, we can feed it to large context llm like gemini and directly chat with it.

And you can change the repo:

There is one problem that needs to be solved, and that is speed, since the project stores the repo data, we need to somehow reuse that to improve the chat speed. I have made the repo setting to allow to input commit and branch, so if the settings match with the ones the app had stored, we can immediately reuse the processed data with doing unnecessary processing.
That's all from this post, make sure to check out the repo to learn more about this project. It is made with svelte with hono as api, all in one folder which is kinda cool.]]></summary>

I developed QAutoGame, a retro-style arcade racing game constructed using Python and Pygame, powered by Amazon Q Developer. The game is played by controlling a pixel car, dodging traffic, and collecting orbs to earn more points. There are three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), customizable sound settings, and a high score system. The retro 8-bit aesthetic and minimal controls render QAutoGame nostalgic and entertaining for users of all ages.
What's enjoyable about QAutoGame is its simplicity and replayability—due to Amazon Q's coding assistance, I could experiment with game logic, optimize performance, and rapidly test features like difficulty scaling, pausing mechanics, and score persistence




Check out the video demo:
YouTube Demo Video
Code Repository
Amazon Q Developer played a crucial role during my game development journey. I utilized Q to:
Create and rework neat Python code for various game modules.

Fix movement, collision check, and sound effect logic.

Accelerate UI creation for the menu screen and instructions window.

Add high-score saving with JSON and enhance code modularity.

Q helped me stay in flow while building and made handling tricky parts like pausing and continuing the game without introducing bugs easier. My tip: break your logic into small pieces and use Q Developer step by step—it works best when your requests are short and specific.

Back in 2009, I just wanted to port Earcut to Flash for a mini-game I was working on. And honestly? It worked — for a while. But over time, I realized that simple solutions tend to fall apart the moment you try to push them to their limits.
That’s when I dove into the theory - digging through research papers, YouTube tutorials, and whatever else I could find. One of the most helpful resources was a book by A.V. Skvortsov. Eventually, I landed on the classic approach: decomposing a polygon into monotone pieces. It seemed obvious. And oh - I hit every possible wall while trying to make it work.
The first big insight? Replace float with int. That alone got me almost there. But the algorithm was still fragile. Really fragile. Self-intersections, collinear edge…]]></summary>

Build a Multi-Container App with Docker Compose


Modern apps rely on multiple services (like a web server, API, and database). 
Docker Compose orchestrates these services, handling networking and dependencies. Without it, you’d manually start each container and connect them a recipe for errors.

Under the proposed rules, crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks.
Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hong Kong-based fintech firm RedotPay has reportedly launched its cryptocurrency-enabled payment cards in South Korea, positioning itself as a potential disruptor in a market dominated by traditional credit card firms and mobile payment services.
The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.
In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential election.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.
