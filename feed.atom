Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. My solutions are written in Python first, and then converted to Perl. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given an array of numbers with even length.
Write a script to return the count of distinct average. The average is calculate by removing the minimum and the maximum, then average of the two.
The first thing to observe is this task mentions numbers, and not integers. And it's a well known fact that the average of 0.2 and 0.4 is not 0.3
>>> (0.2 + 0.4) / 2
0.30000000000000004

To mitigate this, I use the decimal module in Python, and the bignum module in Perl. Both of these will handle non…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I never really liked the term “10x engineer” for many reasons:
It’s more of a buzzword than a real thing
It doesn’t really measure growth or success
It’s thrown around way too much for it to be true in every case
I’ve never met a true “10x engineer” that called himself as such
There are people that write legendary code, avoid meetings, and outperform entire teams? Yes, but I prefer the term “Self Guided Missile”. You point them at a target and they figure out how to hit it on their own, no micro-management needed.
That’s why these people avoid meetings and dodge calls, they would rather keep their flow state, finish their task independently, and direct report when they’re done. (Definitely talking from personal experience here)
Excellent people select their goal and reach it independently
Strong people need to be shown the goal and reach it themselves
Average people need weekly guidance to reach goals
Below average people often don’t reach goals even with constant guidance
If you’re a startup founder looking to build your MVP quick and get to market fast, you don’t need a round of investment to hire a team of below average senior engineers. You need to partner with a single “Self Guided Missile” that can ship your product while you focus on the business and sales.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tutorial explains how to store and get value locally using AsyncStorage component in react native application. AsyncStorage is a simple, unencrypted, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system that is global to the app. It should be used instead of LocalStorage. It is recommended that you use an abstraction on top of AsyncStorage instead of AsyncStorage directly for anything more than light usage since it operates globally. React Native has its own solution for this by giving us a proper fully ready component named as AsyncStorage, AsyncStorage is used to store value locally in both Android and iOS react native applications by providing us a Key factor. Developers can retrieve saved value from anywhere or any activity in complete application using the Unique Key. AsyncStorage component helps to store the user login session details in login and registration system.
Note: The stored value is permanent and can be accessible after closing the app or restarting the mobile until its been deleted.

How to make a scalable folder structure that is clean and consistent


How to make sure your project works in different environments


How to set up professional ESLint and Prettier configs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Feature-Based Architecture is an organizational pattern where code is grouped by feature or domain, instead of by file type. In traditional React project structures, it's common to see directories like components/, pages/, hooks/, and utils/ at the top level. This might work for small projects, but it quickly becomes hard to manage as the app grows.
🧩 Traditional Structure (By File Type)

│   ├── PostList.tsx
├── pages/
│   └── PostsPage.tsx
├── hooks/

├── types/

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.
From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”
For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (…]]></summary>

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.
