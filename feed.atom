Se tem uma coisa que realmente me motiva é ver um projeto bem organizado. Até então, eu vinha utilizando apenas arquivos como BACKLOG e CHANGELOG para manter a organização, o que já ajudava bastante — mas percebi que esse método possui algumas limitações, principalmente conforme o projeto cresce ou envolve mais colaboradores.
Foi então que decidi me aprofundar mais no assunto e criar este post. Um ótimo exemplo de repositório bem estruturado que recomendo analisar é o do tabnews.com.br, mantido pelo Filipe Deschamps. Ele adota boas práticas de organização que pode…]]></summary>

Inside the class, I define methods and map them to specific HTTP requests. For example, I map a method that converts a name to uppercase using:
@GetMapping("/uppercase/{name}")
When an HTTP GET request is made to this endpoint (e.g., /vowelsController/uppercase/John), the method executes its logic and returns a response.
Since this is a REST controller, the response is automatically returned in JSON (or XML) format, which can be consumed by a frontend application. Based on the returned data, we can design the user interface to display the output.

Over time, I started to notice that the biggest improvements in my workflow didn't come from learning new frameworks or languages, but from small, boring habits.
Here are a few that really helped me:
Writing short and clear commit messages. Sounds basic, but it makes a huge difference when looking back at history.
Naming variables like someone else will read them. Because they will.
Taking 5 minutes before starting work to plan what I’m actually going to do. Not big planning, just a few lines in a notebook.
Leaving small comments in code, even when I think “it’s obvious”. Future me usually disagrees.
Closing Slack when I need to focus. Seriously.
None of these are impressive or hard. But doing them consistently changed how I work and made collaboration smoother for everyone involved.
If you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, maybe it's not your stack — maybe it's just your habits.

Spammers are individuals or groups who send unsolicited messages or advertisements, often via email or social media, to a large audience in an attempt to sell products or services, spread malware, or promote dubious schemes. Their primary goal is to reach as many targets as possible, regardless of the relevance or consent of the recipients. This behavior is often viewed as intrusive and annoying, leading to various regulations and filtering methods.

When I first started coding, the message was clear: “Master the language. Learn every detail. Know your tools inside out.”
But today? I’m not so sure.
We’re entering a new era one where artificial intelligence is changing not just how we write code, but how we learn and interact with it. And honestly, it raises a big question:
Does it still make sense to deeply learn programming languages in the age of AI?
🔥 AI Is Redefining the Learning Curve
Forget looking up JavaScript array methods for the tenth time. AI will suggest them.
Learning coding in the traditional sense. Studying textbooks, memorizing methods, perfecting syntax might soon feel outdated.
🧠 From Memorizing to Understanding
Instead of spending months or years mastering every detail of a language, the focus will move toward:
Understanding logic and system design
🤖 AI Can Teach You Too
Imagine this:
You don’t know how a React hook works? Ask ChatGPT and get a full explanation plus example code.
This changes the whole dynamic.
📚 What Might Replace Deep Coding Knowledge
Here’s where I think future developers will stand out:
Problem-solving skills
Because here’s the truth:
If you understand best practices, data structures, algorithms, and system design, you’ll spot issues AI might miss. You’ll catch edge cases that generic models overlook.
So while the way we learn is changing, the value of understanding coding remains high.
🧭 My Advice for Future Developers
🧠 Final Thoughts
AI isn’t removing the need for developers, it’s redefining what makes a great developer.
And the good news?
👉 What do you think? Will coding knowledge become less important in five years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices.
World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.
Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.

The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.
However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.
PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.
This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, Ge…]]></summary>

Synthetix said in a May 14 blog post that it plans to acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million. 
The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.

Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by "risk-on" sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.

“It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on May 13, adding that stablecoins are especially urgent because the country has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.”

Solana's $10.9 billion TVL surpassed the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem.

Solana’s 30-day fee revenue ($43.4 million) rose 109% compared to the previous month.

SOL’s 8% funding rate shows healthy leverage demand from bulls.

Solana’s native token SOL (SOL) surged 24.8% between May 6 and May 10, following the broader altcoin market rally after Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Since then, SOL has struggled to stay above $180, but derivatives and onchain data still suggest further gains are in store.

Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.
