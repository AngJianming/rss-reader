According to a May 22 announcement, the DOJ unsealed charges against the 48-year-old Moscovite with a federal indictment. Gallyamov is allegedly the malware developer behind the Qakbot botnet. 
“Today’s announcement of the Justice Department’s latest actions to counter the Qakbot malware scheme sends a clear message to the cybercrime community,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ’s criminal division.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Next.js layout.tsx is a shared UI component between routes. layout.tsx never rerenders when we navigate from one route to another. We use layout to render static elements that are not supposed to be changed. Like, the Header, Footer, etc. It means, layout keeps your component/pages or UI the same way and renders the page.tsx in it as children, if you want.

layout and template


Just like layout template also wraps the pages and components as children. But the main difference between layout and template is, layout can keep the current state, but template can't. That's why layout does not change the UI or does not manipulate the DOM. On the other hand, template does not hold the state value. It changes the state rerenders the UI, and manipulates the DOM.
Creating a template is very simple. 
Create a file named template.tsx/jsx/js.. in your desired directory.
In the template, returning a React component is compulsory.
Do as you do in layout.tsx




import SignUp from './signup';

export default function MyTemplate({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <main>
      <SignUp />
      {children}
    </main>
  );
}


In summary, don't use template for static assets. Use it for where state needs to be changed and rerender the component.
'use client'


Sometimes you may need to use 'use client'.
When you use any React hook or state (useState, useEffect) in your template

Attaches event handlers or relies on browser APIs (window, document)
Imports other Client Components (e.g., a carousel, chart, or provider) 
Once "use client" is present, all imports become part of the client bundle.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angular is a powerful, open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. Built on TypeScript, Angular enables developers to create scalable, high-performance single-page applications (SPAs) using a component-based architecture, which breaks the user interface into reusable, self-contained pieces for easier development and maintenance.
Key features include two-way data binding for seamless synchronization between the UI and application data, a robust dependency injection system for modularity, and built-in tools for routing, forms, and client-server communication. Angular also offers a comprehensive Command-Line Interface (CLI) for rapid project setup and development, as well as official support for server-side rendering and advanced UI libraries, such as Angular Material.
Trusted by major enterprises and startups alike, Angular remains a top choice for building modern, reliable web applications in 2025.

For example, a study conducted by IDC in 2021 estimated that on average, approximately 270 GB of healthcare and life science data will be created for every person in the world. The National Library of Medicine predicts that by 2025 the world’s human population will be 8 billion people. The scale and scope of having this amount of data to leverage is both enormous and daunting.
This is not a new problem; the phrase “Data Rich, Information Poor” was coined in 1996 to define the struggles healthcare organizations had in reviewing medical data, records, patient information, and medical history. If this was identified as a problem 25+ years ago, why is it that when we collect so much data today, we become information poor? CI…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you start a Go project, you usually copy something old, grab a half-broken boilerplate, or stitch together folders until it “feels right.”
But what if you had a clean, versioned starting point — designed from day one to scale, evolve, and stay sane?
That’s where goboot comes in.
goboot?


goboot is a deterministic scaffolding tool for Go projects.

Not a framework. Not a code dump.

Instead: a modular, developer-first CLI that grows clean Go projects in structured, maintainable layers.
It’s designed for:
OSS maintainers who care about hygiene
Indie builders and backend devs who hate chaos
Infrastructure/codegen projects that need reproducibility
v0.0.0 – Structured Bootstrap with Real Output


The first public release is more than just layout:
CLI entrypoint: goboot

Working service system (base_project)
Go text/template rendering — both in paths and file content

A fully functional scaffold generator with placeholders and structure
Full documentation: README, ROADMAP, VERSIONING, ADRs, diagrams
This means goboot already does something useful:

It can render a minimal project scaffold from a config, cleanly and reproducibly.
Modular by default (cmd/, pkg/, configs/, templates/)
Deterministic output — no random CLI magic
Layered roadmap with minimalism, security, and CI in mind
No runtime reflection, no global state, no magic
It’s boring on purpose — so your projects don’t fall apart.
Next milestones include:
CI & lint/test automation
Contributor workflows
Docker support
Template extension system
Plugin-based generator logic
Full roadmap: ROADMAP.md
git clone https://github.com/it-timo/goboot.git
cd goboot
go run ./cmd/goboot/main.go


`
This will invoke the base_project service — rendering a basic project scaffold from templates using your config.

Rate limiting is a critical defensive strategy for web applications, allowing you to control the flow of incoming and outgoing requests. By restricting how many requests a client can make in a given time window, you can maintain system stability, prevent abuse, and ensure fair resource allocation across your user base.
This configuration demonstrates infrastructure-level rate limiting by setting request identifiers, allocating memory, defining burst-tolerant limits, and applying rules to specific URLs.
Effective backend rate limiting is foundational for:
  System Stability: Prevents resource exhaustion during traffic spikes
  Security Enhancement: Mitigates brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and DDoS attempts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, on Decentralize with Cointelegraph, we break down a pivotal moment for US crypto legislation. 
In a 66–32 procedural vote on May 19, the US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.

Breaking down GENIUS
The GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.
“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week…]]></summary>

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…]]></summary>

In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. 
“This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. 
Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.

In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals.

Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.

Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.
“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.”

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks
This is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significa…]]></summary>

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.

Spotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.
