        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decentralized finance platform Synthetix is planning to venture further into crypto derivatives with plans to re-acquire the crypto options platform Derive.
Synthetix said in a May 14 blog post that it plans to acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million. 
The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.
Derive originally launched as Lyra in 2021, having spun out from the Synthetix ecosystem. Synthetix said the acquisition is part of a broader strategy that includes…]]></summary>

This is a fantastic, practical question that hits on a common performance bottleneck in MySQL: deep pagination. When the offset in a LIMIT offset, count clause is very large, query performance can plummet dramatically. A query for LIMIT 0,20 might be lightning fast, while LIMIT 1000000,20 on the same 10-million-row table could take many seconds, or even minutes.
Let’s break down why this happens and explore effective solutions.

If you're working with variadic templates in C++, you might find the need to call methods from base classes within a derived class. This involves invoking the same method name but potentially returning a different pointer depending on which base class is present. In your case, you are using a lambda function to execute this logic. Here, we will explore how to streamline the syntax of your D::onMethod() function while achieving the same functionality without using a lambda.
Understanding the Problem
In your original code, the derived class D inherits from multiple base classes specified in the variadic template. Each base class has an onMethod() that returns a pointer to the Ret object. You want to call onMethod() for each of the base classes and return the first non-null resul…]]></summary>

আজ আপনাদের সাথে শেয়ার করতে চাই আমার React Native & Next.js প্রজেক্টে npm থেকে pnpm-এ মাইগ্রেশনের অভিজ্ঞতা। সম্প্রতি প্রজেক্টের node_modules এর সাইজ একটু বেড়ে গিয়ে ছিল - প্রায় ১৫ গিগাবাইট!
একটি মিডিয়াম সাইজের অ্যাপের জন্য এত স্পেস?
আমি জানতাম pnpm ক্যাশিং ব্যবহার করে, কিন্তু পুরোপুরি pnpm-এ মাইগ্রেট করতে আমি একটু অলস ছিলাম। তবে পরে pnpm-এর হার্ড লিংকিং এবং সিমলিংক (Symbolic Link) ব্যবস্থাপনা নিয়ে বিস্তারিত রিসার্চ করলাম। এটি গ্লোবালি প্যাকেজ সংরক্ষণ করে এবং প্রজেক্টে সিমলিংকের মাধ্যমে ব্যবহার করে, যা স্পেস এবং ইনস্টলেশনের সময় উভয়ই কমিয়ে আনে।
প্রথমে সব node_modules মুছে দিলাম (rm -rf node_modules)
PNPM ইনস্টল করলাম (npm install -g pnpm)
নতুন করে ডিপেন্ডেন্সি ইনস্টল করলাম (pnpm install)
গ্লোবাল স্টোর: সব প্রজেক্টে একই প্যাকেজের শুধু একটি কপি রাখে
হার্ড লিংক: প্রতিটি প্রজেক্টে আলাদা কপি না করে লিংক তৈরি করে
সিমলিংক: যেখানে দরকার সেখানে সিমলিংক ব্যবহার করে
✅ ইনস্টলেশন স্পিড ২x ফাস্টার (১৫ মিনিট → ৭ মিনিট) ⚡
✅ node_modules সাইজ ৭০% কম (১৫GB → ৪.৫GB) 💾
✅ একই প্যাকেজ সব প্রজেক্টে শেয়ার হয় 🔄
✅ CI/CD পাইপলাইন ব্লেজিং ফাস্ট
স্পেস সেভিং: একই প্যাকেজ বারবার ডাউনলোড হয় না
সিকিউরিটি: ফ্যান্টম ডিপেন্ডেন্সি প্রবলেম ফিক্স করে
ফ্যামিলিয়ার: সব কমান্ড Yarn/npm এর মতোই
সুপার ফাস্ট: স্মার্ট ক্যাশিং সিস্টেম
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install


কেউ কি PNPM ইউজ করছেন? নাকি এখনও Yarn/npm এ আটকে আছেন?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i’ve been using both windsurf & cursor back and forth on my projects and here’s what i felt:
cursor (agentic flow) is amazing
– agentic cursor is powerful when you set up your .cursorrule around the project. it really follows that base and delivers way better output.
– cursor + claude 3.5 always works for me when generating code—I get cleaner, more accurate snippets than with gpt-4o.
– cost-wise it’s the priciest: credits disappear fast if you let it run wild through agentic mode. and blindly accepting every change without checking which files got updated will literally be a nightmare :)
for enterprises: cursor ships with SOC 2 certification and a privacy mode so your code never gets stored remotely, plus you can swap between models (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, custom) and even bring your own API key [if needed].
windsurf
– crazy fast. even when i compare windsurf + claude 3.5 vs cursor + claude 3.5, windsurf spits out code way quicker (maybe it’s my illusion 😂, but the speed difference is legit).
– cost = $15/mo. cursor is $20/mo (or $16/mo on a yearly plan).
– simpler setup—less “magic” under the hood, so fewer surprises with unwanted errors. it offers on-prem for enterprise and zero-data-retention if you care about IP.
– windsurf’s cascade agent can write changes directly to disk so you see live updates before accepting diffs.
so here’s my final thought:
– cursor wins on complex, multistep tasks and context-heavy flows; windsurf wins when you just need quick, reliable code without a ton of config.
– both run inside vscode—they’re basically vscode clones under the hood, so the UI and feel are nearly identical.
– both support AI terminal commands, inline edits, auto-generated commit messages, and full extension compatibility via the VS Code marketplace.
TL;DR
both tools only really perform if you know the fundamentals & how to use them; otherwise it’s just another piece of software.
so that’s it.]]></summary>

This follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) rule — the item added first is the one that comes out first.

FIFO rule.
In programming terms, putting items in the queue is called enqueue, and removing items from the queue is called dequeue.
We can implement the queue in any programming language like C, C++, Java, Python or C#, but the specification is pretty much the same.
A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT) that allows the following operations:
- Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
- Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this content originally on my website : https://alsohelp.com/blog/typescript-get-all-but-last-element
Whereas the answer is initially pretty straightforward, this blog article is mostly for beginners, and how to think about code readability for others.
Here is the article :
What if you want to get all elements but the last one inside an array in TypeScript ?
Well, it's a JS feature, that should be relevant in any environment.
The answer is
// remove only the last element of array a
let b = a.slice(0, -1);
// a is left as-is
// b is all but the last element

A more complete TS example would be
const a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = a.slice(0, -1);
console.log(result); // Will output [1, 2, 3]
console.log(a); // Will output [1, 2, 3, 4]

However, I'm not 100% satisfied with that.
It works, and has no side-effect, which means you can confidently pipe the output.
But it's not very readable.
There is no a.getAllButLastElement, which would be a lot more convenient to read (and to remember!)
So if you want to avoid over-engineering, you have no other option than commenting directly the code :
const a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const result = a.slice(0, -1); // remove last elt only
console.log(result);
console.log(a);

Mmh works, it is readable, but I'm still not 100% satisfied with that.
It's not re-usable accross the project
So finally I would use something like this :
function allButLast<T>(arr: T[]): T[] {
  return arr.slice(0, -1);
}

const a: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const result = allButLast(a);

console.log(result);
console.log(a);

Good!
Now this is reusable, and self-documented.
So that's it for today, solve this was not a big deal, but you can notice how to tackle elegantly a simple problem on real-world projects.
Best,

“One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in go…]]></summary>

A brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, was foiled after the daughter and passersby reportedly fought off the kidnappers.
Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.
The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by "risk-on" sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.

“It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on May 13, adding that stablecoins are especially urgent because the country has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.”

Solana's $10.9 billion TVL surpassed the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem.

Solana’s 30-day fee revenue ($43.4 million) rose 109% compared to the previous month.

SOL’s 8% funding rate shows healthy leverage demand from bulls.

Solana’s native token SOL (SOL) surged 24.8% between May 6 and May 10, following the broader altcoin market rally after Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Since then, SOL has struggled to stay above $180, but derivatives and onchain data still suggest further gains are in store.

Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.

Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. 

Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.

Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.

Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Defense lawyers have asked a judge to sentence the person responsible for helping post a fake message announcing regulatory approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to roughly a year in prison, countering prosecutors’ request for a two-year sentence.
In a May 13 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Eric Council Jr.’s legal team asked that he be sentenced to no more than one year and one day in prison following his guilty plea. 
Council was part of a group that took control of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) X account in 2024 through a SIM swap attack, posting a message that suggested the regulator had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund listings for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for a way to earn passive income on your crypto without riding the rollercoaster of volatile coins? TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …]]></summary>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

On May 9, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

The outflow occurred as Bitcoin traded above $103,600 and just days after the White House announced a 90-day reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the US and China, easing market concerns and lifting broader investor sentiment.

Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.
Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“
Hu challenged the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Brokerage fintech Robinhood is set to acquire WonderFi, a Canadian crypto firm, for about 250 million Canadian dollars ($179 million) in an all-cash deal to expand its global presence.
The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025, Robinhood said in a May 13 news release.
WonderFi operates two of Canada’s longest-standing regulated crypto trading platforms, Bitbuy and Coinsquare, managing over 2.1 billion Canadian dollars in assets under custody. These platforms offer crypto trading, staking and custody services.
“WonderFi has built a formidable family of brands serving beginner and advanced crypto users alike, making them an ideal partner to accelerate Robinhood’s mission in Canada,” said Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto.

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

A falling wedge breakout projects 40% gains ahead, but $2.80 may act as interim resistance.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

Web3 and privacy-focused web browser Brave Browser has integrated the Cardano blockchain into its native and standalone wallets.
According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:
“Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analys…]]></summary>

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.
