Prometheus is an open-source system monitoring and alerting toolkit originally developed at SoundCloud. A core component of Prometheus is its data model, which defines the different data types used to represent monitored metrics. Understanding these data types is essential for effectively using Prometheus to collect, store, and query monitoring data. This article will delve into Prometheus data types, provide Python code examples to demonstrate their usage, analyze how they change over time (within one minute and five minutes), explain the underlying change principles, and finally present a Prometheus flowchart using English bash box diagrams.

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
HTML to define the content of web pages
CSS to specify the layout of web pages
JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages
What is function?
In JavaScript, a function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It allows you to reuse code, organize logic, and create modular applications.
1. Declaring a Function
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

2. Calling a Function

greet(); // Output: Hello, world!

3. Function with Parameters
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(5, 3)); // Output: 8

For example, MCP (Model Context Protocol) is justifiably getting a lot of attention right now for the incredibly creative scenarios it can enable. But the security vulnerabilities MCP can expose should be a genuine nightmare for any organization, not to mention other major concerns like scaling or managing an MCP endpoint over time. But hey, good news: security, scaling, resiliency, and manageability is what we do!

Mitt usage in nuqs codebase.




Mitt is a tiny 200 bytes functional event emitter. So what are its features?
Microscopic: weighs less than 200 bytes gzipped.


Useful: a wildcard "*" event type listens to all events.


Familiar: same names & ideas as Node’s EventEmitter.


Functional: methods don’t rely on this.


Great Name: somehow mitt wasn’t taken.




Install:


This is how you can install mitt.
$ npm install --save mitt

Usage:





import mitt from 'mitt'

const emitter = mitt()

// listen to an event
emitter.on('foo', e => console.log('foo', e) )

// listen to all events
emitter.on('*', (type, e) => console.log(type, e) )

Docker images form the foundation of your deployed applications, and any misconfiguration, vulnerability, or bloat at this level can have cascading effects on your security posture. PCI-DSS emphasizes minimizing the attack surface, enforcing least privilege, and maintaining traceable controls - all of which can (and should) be implemented directly during image creation.
Start by choosing your base image carefully. Bloated, outdated images not only increase the size of your containers but also multiply the number of possible vulnerabilities. Use minimal, purpose-built base images like Alpine or Distroless whenever possible. These images contai…]]></summary>

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears.

Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside.

However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s (BTC) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>
