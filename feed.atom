No? 🧐

Now do you notice something weird? 🧐
This is something that tripped me up recently — turns out it’s caused by a little CSS behavior called margin collapsing.
🤔 So, what is Margin Collapsing?
As per MDN:
The top and bottom margins of blocks are sometimes combined (collapsed) into a single margin whose size is the largest of the individual margins (or just one of them, if they are equal), a behavior known as margin collapsing. Note that the margins of floating and absolutely positioned elements never collapse.
In simpler terms:
This can make it feel like your margins are “disappearing” — which is exactly what I experienced!
🔧 How to Fix It?
.parent {
  display: flex; /* or grid */
}

🌱 Why This Mattered to Me
After some digging, I found this gem of a page:
Mastering Margin Collapsing - MDN
Highly recommended read if you’ve ever felt CSS was gaslighting you.
✅ TL;DR
If vertical margins seem to “disappear”, margin collapsing might be the culprit


Happens between block elements’ top/bottom margins


Avoid it using display: flex, grid, or some padding






Would love to hear if you’ve faced this before — or if this helped you spot a sneaky bug. Let me know below! 👇]]></summary>

Nos últimos anos, vi de perto o impacto da má gestão técnica: times extremamente talentosos, com stacks modernas e processos de entrega sofisticados, paralisados por falta de clareza, alinhamento e foco. Foi nesse contexto que percebi como a gestão de projetos deixou de ser apenas uma função organizacional e passou a ser um pilar técnico.
A engenharia precisa de autonomia, mas também precisa de direção. Não adianta termos um time que domina o React, o Kubernetes ou o GitHub Copilot se os ciclos são confusos, as prioridades mudam a cada reunião e as entregas perdem consistência.

(Bookmark this—you’ll need it later.)  
🔍 Step 1: Reproduce the Bug Consistently


Before diving into code, make sure you can reliably trigger the issue.  
✅ Ask yourself:  
Does it happen in incognito mode? (Rule out extensions)

Does it occur on mobile vs. desktop?

What’s the exact sequence of actions that causes it?



🚨 Pro Tip: Record the bug with Chrome’s "Recorder" (DevTools > More Tools > Recorder) to replay steps.  
🛠️ Step 2: Isolate the Problem



  
  
  A) Check the Console First




Errors? Look for Uncaught TypeError, Failed to load resource.


Warnings? React hydration issues, deprecated APIs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been building a React-based video editing SDK tailored for apps that need to generate, edit, or enhance video content — especially AI-generated content like explainers, reels, and product showcases.
As more AI tools pump out video content, one big pain point keeps surfacing:
“How do we give users manual control over what the AI just made?”
Most AI video tools can generate content — but they fall short when users want to fine-tune it. You get a video, but can’t easily:
Add styled captions
Adjust scenes 
Sync audio
Edit the timeline 
Apply effects
So I am building a toolkit that lets you embed an editing layer right into your frontend.
Here’s a breakdown of what the SDK offers out-of-the-box:
Media Utils
Extract metadata (video, audio, images)
Resize and fit media for different layouts
Generate audio visualizers
Extract audio from video
Media Parser
Convert .mov / .webm ➝ .mp4
Compress large video files
Handle encoding seamlessly in the background
Lambda Integration
Export videos via AWS Lambda
Save output directly to cloud storage (S3)
Timeline Editor
Trim, split, and arrange media layers
Add & sync text, effects, and audio
Timeline-based editing made React-friendly
AI-Powered Captions
Auto-generate captions from voice/video
Apply styled caption themes
Live Edit Canvas
Drag, resize, rotate video elements
Realtime sync with the timeline
Live preview as you edit
UI Visualizer
Panel-based editor
Built-in state management (with undo/redo)
Effects Engine
Canva-style animations: pop, flicker, fade, zoom
Text effects: typewriter, staggered, bounce
Visual filters for color grading & tone
This SDK is ideal for:
AI video generation tools (ChatGPT agents, script-to-video platforms)
Social media automation apps
Product marketing video builders
Internal tooling for media teams
Watch it in action?

The syndicate was dismantled on May 15, resulting in the arrest of nine men and three women in mainland China and Hong Kong. 
The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17.
The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 re…]]></summary>

"The downside of the public internet is it was never built for high-performance systems. It was always built for this sort of relationship of one big server talking to one little server," Federa told Cointelegraph in an interview at Consensus 2025. The executive explained:

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.

“Bitcoin Reserve,” Mizrachi wrote to X on May 16 after meeting El Salvador-based Bitcoiners Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert.
While Mizrachi didn’t share details about his discussions with Keiser and Herbert, the timing of the post came 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak.

The creation of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama City would follow a recently approved measure permitting the use of crypto for public payments, including taxes, fines and municipal fees.

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight.
“The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A federal judge sentenced Eric Council Jr., who participated in posting a fake announcement on the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s X account saying it would approve spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs, to 14 months in prison.
Following a May 16 hearing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department announced that Council would serve 14 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.
“Schemes of this nature threaten the health and integrity of our market system,” said Jeanine Pirro, interim US Attorney for the District of Columbia. “SIM swap schemes threaten the financial security of average citizens, financial institutions, and government agencies.”
