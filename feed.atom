🧠 La regulación de la inteligencia artificial se ha convertido en un campo de batalla político y técnico. Según un reciente informe, el Comité de Energía y Comercio de la Cámara de Representantes de EE.UU. busca prohibir que los estados legislen sobre IA, argumentando que la fragmentación regulatoria podría frenar la innovación. Este movimiento refleja una tensión global: ¿debe la gobernanza de la IA ser centralizada o descentralizada? Mientras la Unión Europea avanza con su Ley de IA, Estados Unidos debate si seguir un modelo federal o permitir que estados como California impongan sus propias reglas.

The FloatingActionButton (FAB) is a staple in Material Design apps, typically used for primary actions. But what if you want to make it draggable, allowing users to reposition it anywhere on the screen, preventing from covering other parts of the screen or even texts in other widgets.
Better UX: Lets users place the FAB where it’s most convenient.
Avoids Obstructions: Useful when the FAB might block important content.
Engagement: Adds a playful, interactive element to your app.
1. Setting Up the Widget Structure


We’ll use:
Stack → To overlay the FAB on top of other content.
Positioned → To control the FAB’s coordinates.
GestureDetector → To handle drag gestures.
We calculate the initial position after the first frame render to ensure correct placement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scheduling Tasks with cron


Introduction:
cron is a powerful time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems.  It allows you to automate tasks, such as running backups, cleaning up logs, or sending emails, at specified intervals.  This article provides a brief overview of using cron.
Prerequisites:
To use cron, you need access to a Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, BSD) with a cron daemon running.  You'll also need sufficient permissions to edit your crontab (cron table).  This is typically done using the command crontab -e.
Features:
cron uses a simple syntax to define schedules.  Each line in your crontab represents a single task.  The format is:
* * * * * command
Where the five asterisks represent (in order): minute (0-59), hour (0-23), day of month (1-31), month (1-12), and day of week (0-6, Sunday=0).  An asterisk () means "every."  You can use ranges (e.g., 1-10), lists (e.g., 1,5,10), and step values (e.g., `/5` for every 5 minutes).
For example, to run a script myscript.sh every day at 3 AM:
0 3 * * * /path/to/myscript.sh

Advantages:
Automation: Automates repetitive tasks without manual intervention.
Reliability: Ensures tasks run consistently, regardless of user login.
Flexibility:  Allows for precise scheduling, from seconds to months.
Simplicity:  Relatively easy to learn and use.
Disadvantages:
Complexity:  The scheduling syntax can become complex for intricate schedules.
Error Handling:  Requires careful error handling within the scheduled scripts.
Resource Usage:  Poorly written scripts can consume excessive system resources.
Conclusion:
cron is a vital tool for system administrators and developers. Its ability to automate tasks saves time and ensures reliable operation.  Understanding its syntax and potential pitfalls is crucial for effective use.  Remember to always test your cron jobs thoroughly to avoid unintended consequences.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An OA interview stands for Online Assessment interview. It’s usually the first technical step in the hiring process for internships or entry-level roles at companies like Snowflake, TikTok, Google, etc.
An OA is a timed, remote coding test you take before interviews. It’s designed to screen candidates efficiently.
Delivered through platforms like Codility, HackerRank, Karat, or CodeSignal.
Timed (usually 60–90 minutes).
May include 1–3 coding problems, and sometimes MCQs on CS fundamentals.
Often automatically graded based on correctness and performance.
Snowflake OA — “Unequal Elements” Problem


While this isn’t an official published problem, “Unequal Elements” is a known Snowflake OA coding challenge that has appeared in past intern or new grad assessments.
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to remove so that no two remaining elements are equal (i.e., all elements are unique).
Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Remove one 2 and two 3s to make the array [1,2,3] — all elements are unique.

Count the frequency of each element.
For each element with a frequency > 1, you need to remove (freq - 1) duplicates.
Sum up all the duplicates to be removed.
from collections import Counter

def min_removals_to_make_unique(arr):
    freq = Counter(arr)
    removals = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        if count > 1:
            removals += count - 1
    return removals

# Example
print(min_removals_to_make_unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]))  # Output: 3

Practice on LeetCode – Focus on:
Hashing problems
Arrays and frequency counts
Greedy strategies



Do mock tests on Codility / HackerRank
Understand problem patterns — like making arrays distinct, sorting with constraints, subarrays, etc.
Let me know if you'd like a mock Snowflake OA with similar problems or if you want to practice with time limits.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Destructuring is a powerful feature in JavaScript (and TypeScript) that lets you unpack values from arrays or extract properties from objects into distinct variables.
Basic Example
const nums = [10, 20, 30];

const [first, second] = nums;

console.log(first);  // 10
console.log(second); // 20


Skipping values
const [ , , third] = nums;
console.log(third); // 30

Default values
const [a = 1, b = 2, c = 3] = [undefined, undefined];
console.log(a, b, c); // 1 2 3


2. Object Destructuring
Basic Example
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

const { name, age } = user;

console.log(name); // "Alice"
console.log(age);  // 25

Renaming variables
const { name: fullName } = user;
console.log(fullName); // "Alice"


Default values
const { city = "Unknown" } = user;
console.log(city); // "Unknown"

const data = {
  user: {
    profile: {
      username: "bob123",
      email: "bob@example.com"
    }
  }
};

const {
  user: {
    profile: { username }
  }
} = data;

console.log(username); // "bob123"


With objects
function greet({ name, age }: { name: string; age: number }) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}, age ${age}`);
}

greet({ name: "Charlie", age: 30 });

With arrays
function sum([a, b]: [number, number]) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(sum([5, 7])); // 12


Arrays
const [head, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(head); // 1
console.log(tail); // [2, 3, 4]

Objects
const { a, ...rest } = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
console.log(a);    // 1
console.log(rest); // { b: 2, c: 3 }


Destructuring with TypeScript Types
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
};

const user: User = { id: 1, name: "Dana" };

const { id, name, email = "N/A" } = user;]]></summary>
