It's a go-to for many developers and organizations looking to showcase their projects, documentation, or personal portfolios. However, there's a hidden risk associated with using custom domains with GitHub Pages that isn't widely discussed: domain squatting.
By default, GitHub's documentation suggests that setting up a custom subdomain for your GitHub Pages site is pretty straightforward. You simply need to create a CNAME record in your DNS settings that points to ORGANIZATION.github.io. This process is well-documented and seems secure at first glance.

If programming languages are analogous to natural languages, dynamic typing is like "handwritten shorthand"—fast but prone to scribbled errors—while static typing resembles "printed text": standardized and rigorous, though requiring upfront structuring. As the core development language for HarmonyOS 5, Cangjie chooses a static type system as its security foundation.
In Cangjie, the types of all variables and expressions are determined at compile time. Take this simple addition function, for example:
func add(x: Int8, y: Int8) -> Int8 {  
    return x + y  
}  

If you attempt to pass string parameters like add("1", "2"), the compiler will throw an error immediately, rather than letting the program crash at runtime. This design brings…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction:


As a step that's already disrupting the tech industry, Apple is getting ready to launch its newest innovation — Apple's new liquid glass UI. The revolutionary interface will revolutionise user interaction on Apple devices, presenting a more immersive, fluid, and intuitive experience than ever.
What is Apple's New Liquid Glass UI?


Apple's Liquid Glass UI is said to combine real-time dynamic elements with sophisticated glass-like visuals, featuring ultra-smooth transitions, depth, and light reflections that resemble real glass. It's a departure from flat design to something more immersive and tactile.
Key Features to Look Forward To:
Next-Generation Visual Appearance: Liquid transitions and glow-like reflections will add more visual beauty to the UI.
Improved Responsiveness: Closer touch feedback and quicker response times.
Deeper Integration with AR: Flawless layering of UI with AR content for an integrated mixed-reality experience.
Battery & Performance Optimisation: Even with the visual upgrades, Apple is targeting efficiency, taking advantage of its M-series chips.
Why It Matters:


This is more than a visual refresh — it's Apple restating its dominance in UX design. The liquid glass UI fits into Apple's broader move into spatial computing, perhaps laying the groundwork for next-generation hardware such as the Vision Pro and future iPhones.
Conclusion:


Apple's new liquid glass UI is a forward-thinking leap in design and functionality. As a developer, designer, or regular user, Apple's future ecosystem is set to be more interactive and visually appealing than ever.]]></summary>

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) is a powerful paradigm used primarily in asynchronous programming, especially in JavaScript. Its flexibility and scalability make it indispensable for modern web applications, allowing for responsive, interactive user experiences and facilitating scalable application designs. This comprehensive article delves deep into EDA, tracing its historical development, providing advanced coding examples, and exploring real-world applications, performance considerations, potential pitfalls, and advanced debugging techniques.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moving to the cloud has long ceased to be a “fashionable trend” — today it is a strategic necessity. Cloud technologies allow you to increase the fault tolerance, flexibility and scalability of your IT infrastructure. However, migrating to the cloud is not just copy-pasting servers onto virtual machines. The wrong approach can lead to increased costs, downtime of business processes and even data leakage.
In this article, we will analyze the key stages of proper migration and what you should pay attention to in order not to step on the rake.
Why should a business move to the cloud?
Main approaches to migration:
Lift-and-shift (rehosting)
Refactoring / Re-architecting
Replatforming
Step-by-step migration strategy
Analysis of the current infrastructure


Choosing a cloud model


Choosing a cloud provider


Migration planning


Security and compliance


Training and support



Common mistakes during migration
