Whether they are libraries, open-source code, or frameworks, these dependencies often provide the boilerplate functionality, integrations with other platforms, and tooling that make our jobs a little easier.
But of course, one of the burdens of this dependency-driven world is that we are now at the mercy of our dependencies’ updates and schedules. Especially when we’ve added our own customizations and integrations on top.
One common dependency that I (and likely you) have crossed paths with is Salesforce. If Salesforce is part of your ecosystem, you’ve likely added a few of those customizations and integrations. And you’ve likely faced the problem of managing your customizations and integrations when Salesforce issues updates.

If you've been working on a project, such as a learning English application without the internet, you might encounter compilation errors even if your Java version is updated.
Why Compilation Errors Happen in Java
Compilation errors in Java occur for various reasons, including incorrect project setup, missing dependencies, or Java syntax errors. They can be particularly frustrating when everything seems to be in order. In your case, working with VS Code adds another layer of complexity, as it requires proper configuration to recognize installed Java versions and libraries.

It's crucial for the company I work for, too, affecting both cost and user experience.  I've been regularly performing and publishing cloud VM CPU comparisons to share my insights. Although my primary tool is my own DKbench suite, I tend to include Geekbench 5 in the comparison, mostly due to the abundance of available published results. This is despite Geekbench 6 being available for some time now. You might wonder why I haven't switched: Simply put, I found that Geekbench 6 multi-core is fundamentally "broken", and I thought I'd explain why.
Geekbench 6 barely scales on multi-core systems. This is unlike Geekbench 5, which, although not linear at scaling, continuously benefits from additional …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[C# 14 enhances its elegant null-safety tools by allowing null-conditional operators ?. and ?[] to appear on the left-hand side of assignment expressions.
This new capability removes repetitive null checks and brings a new level of composability and safety to common mutation patterns in object graphs and collections.
In this post, you’ll explore:
What is null-conditional assignment
What's new in C# 14
Real-world usage examples
Supported assignment operations
Limitations and best practices
Before C# 14, you needed explicit null checks before assigning to a property:
if (customer is not null)
{
    customer.Order = GetCurrentOrder();
}

Or use a ternary:
customer?.Order = customer is not null ? GetCurrentOrder() : null;

Both approaches were verbose or redundant.
Now you can write:

New Hampshire governor signs crypto reserve bill into law
New Hampshire became the first US state to allow its government to invest in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), after Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill passed by the legislature into law.
In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

The asset manager sees BNB’s price rising to approximately $1,275 per token by the end of 2025 and as high as $2,775 by the end of 2028, according to the research report. 
As of May 6, BNB trades at nearly $600 per coin, for a fully diluted value (FDV) of approximately $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

Paws is a Telegram-based Mini App created by the same team behind other projects, such as Notcoin and Dogs. 
If you’ve been cruising around Telegram lately, chances are you’ve stumbled upon Paws, the viral crypto Mini App that’s got everyone tapping, clicking and inviting their friends like it’s 2010 FarmVille all over again. 
Originally launched in October 2024 on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, Paws exploded in popularity with its ultra-simple tap-to-earn concept. Think of it as a gamified rewards engine embedded directly in Telegram, where users rack up points by completing tasks, referring others and interacting with mini-game elements.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”
