In this post, we’ll be diving into what makes quantum computing different from the classical kind you know and love, where each excels, and why it’s likely to play a key role in shaping our future. Don’t worry, you don’t need to have a physics degree, I promise! It’s a straightforward, down-to-earth explanation, perfect for curious minds who’ve heard the buzz and want to know what the big deal is.

Today I want to explore how to recreate (most of) GitHub's markdown-powered textarea. It is a feature I want to add to Rails Designers (private community for Rails UI engineers) and thought it would be nice to share my first version with you.
I like this approach as the HTML's textarea is available in all browsers and can be used to write any comment, prose or whatever else needed with markdown. JavaScript is not needed, but if present it enhances the experience a fair bit.
What I intend to add today:
basic formatting options (bold, italic, etc.);
paste urls to markdown;
fetch page title from URL;
drag & drop images to upload with ActiveStorage.

In this tutorial we will cover the basics of working with buffers and windows (called panes) in Vim using an example-driven approach. To get the most out of it, I strongly recommend that you keep Vim open and follow each step. Do not skip any steps. Just be patient and do each step, one at a time. Actively doing it will reinforce the concepts, making it easier to learn.
A buffer is an area in memory that stores text. Every time you open a file, its contents are read into a buffer, allowing you to make changes to that buffer without affecting the original file.
Let's begin by opening vim. By default you will have one unnamed buffer.  You can view all your buffers using :ls or :buffers.
Use :ls.
:ls
  1 %a   "[No Name]"                    line 1

Indeed, the anxiety surrounding job displacement is firmly rooted in historical experiences where technological leaps have abruptly reshaped employment landscapes.
Yet this picture of conflict and competition misses a profound truth: automation isn’t merely replacing work—it’s fundamentally reshaping our relationship with work. Rather than being adversaries, humans and artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming partners in an evolving dance of productivity, creativity, and innovation.

According to the Cetus team, the DEX is working with the Sui Foundation and other entities within the ecosystem to recover the remainder of the funds. The Sui Foundation also confirmed:
"A large number of validators identified the addresses with the stolen funds and are ignoring transactions on those addresses until further notice. The Cetus team is exploring paths to recover those funds and return them to the community."
The Cetus hack is the latest in a string of such incidents impacting crypto and Web3 in the first half of 2025. Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in crypto, with many industry executives calling for t…]]></summary>

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he and designer Jony Ive are developing these secret devices for mass consumption, with plans to ship 100 million units upon launch.
Ives joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21. 
Neither Altman nor Ives specified what these companion devices would look like or how they would operate. Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

The products will be offered through Backed, a new Kraken partner, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph. Tokens representing the stocks will be stored on the Solana blockchain due to its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem,” the statement said.
“The whole point of crypto is that we're able to see things very transparently,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said during Solana's Accelerate event on May 22. ”It's decentralized. It is open-source.

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”
Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchav…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…]]></summary>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules.
