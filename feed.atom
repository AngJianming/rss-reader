The report, published May 15, surveyed 295 executives across traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies and payment gateways. Nearly half of respondents (49%) said they already use stablecoins in payments, while 23% are conducting pilot tests, and another 18% are in the planning phase.‚Äô
Only 10% of institutions surveyed said they are undecided about stablecoin adoption.

So let‚Äôs skip the warm-up and jump straight into the one structure that quietly powers a ton of efficient solutions but often doesn‚Äôt get the spotlight it deserves:
Hash Tables are data structures that store key-value pairs, and they give you constant-time lookups on average ‚Äî O(1) time complexity for accessing, inserting, and deleting items.
Hash Tables are your go-to when you need to:
Count things (like frequencies of characters or items)
Track what you‚Äôve seen (e.g., duplicates)
Map one thing to another (like IDs to objects)
They're elegant, fast, and can simplify problems that otherwise require nested loops.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been ‚Äúhiccups‚Äù in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. 
Though Grewal said there were disputes over ‚Äúsubstantial issues that need to be addressed‚Äù in the bill, he hinted that Trump‚Äôs involvement in the industry was a ‚Äúcomplicating factor.‚Äù¬†

Bitcoin‚Äôs struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.
