That was the message I sent to a friend late one night. I had just spent two hours trying to figure out why Navigator.of(context).pop() wasn't working. Turns out, I was using the wrong BuildContext something so small, yet it caused a huge ripple in my app.
If you’ve been building Flutter apps for a while, chances are you’ve bumped into BuildContext quite a few times. It’s that ever-present parameter in the build() method. But do you really understand what it is?
If not, don’t worry. Let’s walk through this together, from beginner to expert using real-world examples, painful bugs, and best practices.
So, What Is BuildContext?
Think of BuildContext as a pointer to the widget's position in the widget tree.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I learned about: Web3 domain services
Blockchain addresses are not intuitive for everyday users.
Web3 domain services provide memorable names tied to on-chain accounts. This is similar to how DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.
This should help Web3 users own a domain and send/receive transactions.
But, there are adoption challenges.
Examples:
ENS
Unstoppable Domains
Solana Name Service
Handshake
Tezos Domains
Each service resolves domains only within a set of networks but not in others.
This is bad because...
Users need to register their domain at each network
Domains can collide with each other
They use the default DNS servers of the operating system or the browser.
The only partial exception is Brave, which resolves some domains (e.g. .crypto, and .eth)
While you can set up a custom Web3 DNS resolver, you cannot expect every visitor of your Web3 domain to do the same.
Unstoppable Domains kills .coin in the name of .wallet (2022): https://domainnamewire.com/2022/10/18/unstoppable-domains-kills-coin-in-the-name-of-wallet/

What is ENS?: https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900404-what-is-ens

Angular 20 has officially landed! 🎉 As expected, one of the most exciting updates is the continued evolution of Signal-based APIs, a huge step forward in Angular's reactive programming model.
In this post, we'll explore one such API — toSignal() — and learn how it helps bridge the gap between Observables and Signals.
toSignal()?


The toSignal() function allows you to convert an Observable stream into a Signal, enabling integration with Angular’s fine-grained reactive system.
This makes it easier to work with API responses, state changes, and other reactive data sources in a way that's more performant and declarative.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a NoSQL database, data structure varies based on requirements. In a List, data is stored in a specific order, and the position of each element matters. For example, to access the first element in a List, you retrieve the value at index 0, which is predictable due to the ordered nature of Lists.
However, when the order of data is not important, a Dictionary (or key-value store) is more suitable. Consider a scenario where you need to store user information like age, address, first name, and last name. In this case, the sequence of these fields doesn’t matter. With a Dictionary, you can directly access a specific value using its key, such as retrieving the first name by querying the "first_name" key, without needing to know the last name or other fields.
Key differences:
In a List, values are stored with predefined, sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...), and you access data by its position.
In a Dictionary, you define custom keys mapped to values, allowing direct access to data via the key, regardless of order.
Thus, for scenarios where you need flexible, key-based access to data without relying on order, a Dictionary is the preferred choice.
Coffee Menu in Python — Dictionary Operations
Creating a Coffee Menu (Dictionary)
print(coffee_menu)
Accessing a Value (Using Key)
print(coffee_menu['Espresso'])
Output:
Bold shot!
Changing a Value

coffee_menu['Espresso'] = 'Tiny Thunder'
print(coffee_menu)




Output:
Iterating Over the Dictionary
Only Keys
Output:
Keys and Values (Method 1)
Keys and Values (Method 2)
Adding an Item
Removing Items




Using pop(key)

coffee_menu.pop('Espresso')
print(coffee_menu)




Output:
Using popitem()
Removes the last inserted item.
Example Output:
⚠️ Note: If the dictionary is empty, popitem() will raise a KeyError.
Using del Statement

del coffee_menu["Latte"]
print(coffee_menu)




📝 Note:
Each operation was done individually for demonstration, so dictionary contents might look different in each output. In a real program, you'd typically chain these actions as needed.]]></summary>

Target: 16 popular npm packages maintained by the GlueStack project, widely used in React Native development
Attack Type: Supply-chain malware injection
Scale: Nearly 1 million downloads per week collectively
Affected Packages: Not all disclosed yet, but include components of GlueStack CLI and DevOps plugins
*🐛 Identified Malicious Activity  *                                                                                  
📦 Malicious code injection  | Malicious script embedded into modules, triggered via postinstall hook during installation
⚙️ Potential Impact
💻 Developer Projects | Web/mobile apps can be silently tampered with during build process
🛡️ Security Recommendations for Developers
🔄 Immediate Actions:
Audit project dependencies (especially GlueStack CLI, starter kits, plugins)
Run npm audit and scan with tools like Socket.dev or Snyk
Rotate .env files and API tokens if any affected packages were used
🔐 Long-term Prevention:
Enforce lockfile auditing (package-lock.json, yarn.lock)
Use npm ci to prevent unexpected dependency changes
Isolate CI/CD environments from the internet during builds
Enable 2FA on npm and GitHub accounts
🧠 Additional Notes
This attack resembles previous incidents such as:
ua-parser-js compromise (2021)
event-stream backdoor (2018)
Reinforces that developer tools themselves can be a prime attack vector

I’ve been a software developer for 15 years, but becoming a mother taught me new kinds of problem-solving — and patience. This is a story about navigating both worlds: raising two children while building a career in tech.
My journey into software development began with an obsession for solving problems and a slightly unhealthy excitement over building things from nothing. I still remember the thrill of writing my first working piece of code — a basic C program that did some elementary math. Yes, C. You read that right. Guess that makes me officially vintage. But hey, it was magic!
My early career was filled with long hours, debugging marathons, and imposter syndrome. But I loved every bit of it.
