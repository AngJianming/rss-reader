By studying how animals talk—even when surrounded by noise—AI might one day help humans "talk" to animals. This isn’t just fun; it can also help protect animals and learn more about the natural world. Let’s dive into the world of animals, AI, and city noise!
Chapter 1: 
Birds chirp to call their friends or warn others about danger.
Dolphins whistle and click to talk in the ocean.
Dogs bark, growl, and wag their tails to show how they feel.
Bees do a dance to show others where to find flowers.
Even though these "languages" are not the same as human speech, they are still ways of sharing important messages. Scientists want to understand these messages better. That’s where AI comes in.

In this article, we will delve into how wctomb works and explore alternative methods for converting surrogate characters to their UTF-8 equivalents.
Understanding wctomb


The wctomb function in C is designed to convert a wide character (of type wchar_t) to a multibyte character (typically in UTF-8 encoding). However, it has its limitations when it comes to surrogate pairs, which are a special way of encoding characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in Unicode. These characters range from U+D800 to U+DFFF. When trying to convert these values using wctomb, you might encounter unexpected results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the smoldering forges of Old Valyria, where currents roar like dragons and energy flows like wildfire, there sits a silent sovereign—the TWCT-T-D55. Forged in the fires of precision and crowned with 1% accuracy, this current transformer rules the Seven Realms of energy monitoring with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the cunning of Littlefinger. Let us bend the knee to the unyielding guardian of amps and volts.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
TWCT-T-D55 is no mere ironborn gadget. Cast in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers lost to lesser sensors:
Dragonflame Precision: Measures 200A with 1% accuracy—sharper than Oathkeeper’s edge.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy CTs: Clumsy as Hodor, bumbling through phase shifts and kWh errors.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Circuits
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
TWCTs stalk energy vampires like Arya’s List, slashing waste with Needle-like precision. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a $15k savings,” they whisper.
The Siege of Highgarden (Solar Farms):
Guards solar arrays against hail storms and incompetence, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “No panel left behind.”
The Red Wedding (EV Chargers):
Halts faulty chargers mid-zap, sparing Teslas from becoming Dothraki funeral pyres. “The North remembers… proper grounding.”

The Words of House TWCT
Size: Slimmer than a Braavosi blade (55mm), deadlier than a Dornish spear.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy CTs: Bloat like Robert’s waistline, guzzling space and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Measured
The TWCT-T-D55 shall unite the grid.”
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Electrified)

In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…]]></summary>

In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. 
“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”
The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finz…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

On May 5, Zhao shared on X that he had advised Kyrgyzstan to start with Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) when building its national crypto reserve. In 2024, Forbes claimed that Zhao holds about 94 million BNB tokens, or 64% of BNB’s circulating supply. At the time of writing, these tokens are worth about $55 billion. 
The proposal followed Zhao’s earlier announcement that he had begun advising Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency (NIA) on blockchain and crypto-related matters.

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.
