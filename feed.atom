        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Вкратце, жизненный цикл запроса - это последовательность через которую проходит запрос клиента.
Например, у нас есть html страничка. Мы хотим, чтобы, жмакнув по кнопке, пользователь перешёл на неё. Конечно, мы можем просто в href кнопки указать путь и имя нашего html:
href = "путь/явноКрутойФайл.html"
Но есть проблемка. Даже несколько. Во-первых, вдруг эта страница содержит контент, который мы не хотим показывать определённой группе пользователей? Например, мы не хотим, чтобы обычный пользователь попал на админ страничку. А вдруг страница содержит форму отправки данных? Как обработать логику?
Мы можем элегантно решить эти проблемы одним махом - использовать роутер. В нём мы зарегистрируем новый маршрут, который будет связан с контроллером и его методом + мы сможем указать middleware' ы - т.е промежуточные проверки. Тогда план такой:
1) Регистрируем маршрут, указывая необходимые middleware' ы и контроллер
href = "/маршрут"
Теперь мы сможем соблюсти все проверки, красиво вызвать маршрут и использовать необходимую логику 🥳]]></summary>

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Simulation
Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array ans of the same length where ans[i] = nums[nums[i]] for each 0 <= i < nums.length and return it.
A zero-based permutation nums is an array of distinct integers from 0 to nums.length - 1 (inclusive).
Example 1:
Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
Explanation: The array ans is built as follows:




  ans = [nums[nums[0]], nums[nums[1]], nums[nums[2]], nums[nums[3]], nums[nums[4]], nums[nums[5]]]
  = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[1], nums[5], nums[3], nums[4]]
  = [0,1,2,4,5,3]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]

Navigating through forms using the TAB key is an essential feature, especially in web applications. When developing forms in Flutter Web, you may encounter issues where the TAB key does not function as expected. This issue can often arise due to the way focus is managed within the Flutter framework. In this article, we will explore how to troubleshoot and resolve this problem by analyzing the provided code snippet and implementing a solution.
Understanding the Issue
The error message you are encountering is:
"Tried to get the bounds of a focus node that didn't have its context set yet. The context needs to be set before trying to evaluate traversal policies. Setting the context is typically done with the attach method."
This indicates that the context of your Form widget has n…]]></summary>

Optional chaining (?.) is a deceptively simple yet powerful feature that allows you to safely access deeply nested object properties without throwing errors like Cannot read property 'x' of undefined. If you've ever written defensive code like this:
The Problem Before Optional Chaining
During my study or should i say discovery, accessing nested properties in objects required a lot of checks to prevent the infamous type error. For instance, in this scenario:
const user = {profile: {name: "John",},};  console.log(user.profile.name); // "John" console.log(user.profile.age);  // undefined

In this article, we'll explore how to decrypt cookie values retrieved from Google Chrome using C#. If you've stumbled upon encrypted cookies in your code and need a way to decrypt these values effectively, you're in the right place. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the decryption process while using C#.
Understanding the Issue
When accessing cookies stored by Google Chrome, it is common to encounter encrypted values. The cookies are stored in a SQLite database, and the encrypted values can pose a challenge when you need to retrieve the actual data. Chrome uses a specific encryption mechanism that relies on Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) for Windows systems. Therefore, to decrypt the cookies, you must understand this encryption approach.

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee (HFSC), led Democratic lawmakers out of a joint hearing on digital assets in response to what she called “the corruption of the President of the United States” concerning cryptocurrencies.
In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to Donald Trump’s corruption, “ownership of crypto,” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.
HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers at the hearing to create a “lasting framework” on digital assets, but did not directly address any of Rep. Waters’ and Democrats’ concerns about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. He claimed Waters was making the hearing a partisan issue and shutting down discussion on a digital asset regulatory framework.
Rep. Waters’ objection and leading members of Congress opposed to Trump’s “crypto corruption” to a shadow hearing was part of a strategy announced by the Democratic lawmaker on May 5. Amid his 2024 campaign and once taking office in January, Trump has faced criticism for the launch of his memecoin and offer to have top tokenholders attend an exclusive dinner, his family backing the firm World Liberty Financial, and an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm using the platform’s USD1 stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

At the Token2049 event in Dubai, DoubleZero Labs founder and former Solana head of strategy Austin Federa told Cointelegraph that today’s high-performance blockchains like Solana are technically capable of supporting large-scale institutional usage. However, lawyers need to catch up. 
“Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”

In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.

The post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting.

Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on May 3 that he will step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel taking over. This transition raises speculation about Berkshire’s financial capacity to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) under the new leadership.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The CEO of crypto exchange OKX’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) division has called on the industry to prioritize real-world utility as interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) continues to grow.
In a Cointelegraph interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh warned that while tokenization is promising, projects must “clearly demonstrate” the benefits of tokenizing specific assets. 
“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.
He said hype can drive project growth in the Web3 space, but providing everyday value should be the priori…]]></summary>

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 
If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will …]]></summary>

In a May 5 letter to the Office of Government Ethics, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley said that Trump and his family stand to personally profit from an investment involving UAE state-backed firm MGX, crypto exchange Binance and World Liberty Financial (WLFI).
The senators called for an urgent probe, warning the deal may violate the US Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and federal bribery statutes.
At the center of the controversy is WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, reportedly chosen for a $2 billion investment MGX plans to make into Binance.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

Florida’s House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely postponed and withdrawn from consideration” on May 3, according to the Florida Senate. 
Florida’s legislative session adjourned on May 2 without the passage of these two bills, which would have advanced legislation to establish a crypto reserve for the state. The Senate and House agreed to extend the session until June 6 to address budget plans. 
Lawmakers passed about 230 bills during the session, dealing with things like prohibiting putting fluoride in the water, protecting state parks, and a school smartphone ban, but diversifying state treasury portfolios was not amon…]]></summary>

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Tron public relations team confirmed that on May 2, the Tron DAO account posted a contract address and sent direct messages to solicit payments in exchange for promotional advertising on the Tron account.
“Our security team quickly identified the intrusion and cut off access to the hacker, but we ask the community to continue to be vigilant. We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. 
The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000.

On May 5, Tether minted another $1 billion Tether (USDT) on the Tron network, according to Arkham Intelligence. This brings the total USDT on Tron to $71.4 billion, according to the Tether Transparency report. 
In comparison, there is currently $72.8 billion USDT circulating on the Ethereum network, so just $1.4 billion more USDT on Tron will see it become the leading network for the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, as it has been previously over the last two years. 
Tron was ahead of Ethereum for USDT circulation between July 2022 and November 2024, but a large $18 billion mint on Ethereum pushed the network ahead again, according to CryptoQuant…]]></summary>

In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang memb…]]></summary>
