That's exactly the challenge I decided to tackle in my recent project. In this article, I'll take you through my journey of comparing the OCR capabilities of two powerhouse Large Language Models available through Amazon Bedrock: Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Amazon's own Nova Pro.
PDF documents present a unique challenge for text extraction. While they may look like simple text documents to human eyes, they're actually complex containers that can include various elements:
Text layers that may or may not be selectable
Images with embedded text
Complex layouts with tables and multi-column formats
Mixed font styles and sizes

But it's something I can't really avoid at work. I initially thought AI would help a lot, but in reality, it's hard for AI to edit my documents exactly the way I want in terms of format and tone. Sometimes I end up preferring my own version and just submit that instead.
Maybe this is something worth thinking about.

Alright, let's talk about something actually important: is a hot dog a sandwich? Yeah, I know, riveting stuff. But stick with me. I used this classic, pointless debate to test drive Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), and it turned out to be a pretty decent way to show off what you can do with autonomous AI agents without writing a boatload of control logic.
The goal was simple: get AI agents to debate the hot dog question without me holding their hands. Using ADK, I set up a basic scenario:
 The Mission: Settle the Hot Dog Question (or at least try).
 The Squad:

The decision was shared in a May 1 post on X, with Coinbase citing the token‚Äôs failure to meet its listing standards. According to CoinMarketCap, the MOVE token declined by 13.6% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase announced:
"Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur."
The trading suspension follows an ongoing investigation into Movement Labs over an agreement that allegedly influenced the MOVE token price.

"General-purpose L2s should be commodities ‚Äî simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call ‚Äî the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

Strategy‚Äôs stock rose 32% in April, its biggest monthly gain since November.

Speculation is building that Strategy will announce a major capital raise during its Q1 earnings call on May 1 as it continues to grow its Bitcoin holdings.

Analysts expect a 1% year-on-year revenue bump to $116.6 million, following the firm‚Äôs $120.7 million revenues for Q4 2024.

Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy closed April with its highest monthly gain since November, ahead of the firm‚Äôs highly anticipated earnings call on May 1.
