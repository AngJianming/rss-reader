If you've been a Java developer for any length of time, you've likely used Lombok to get rid of repetitive getter/setter/constructor code. It’s a convenient crutch—but like all shortcuts, it comes with trade-offs:
IDE confusion: Code generated behind the scenes sometimes breaks static analysis or autocomplete.
Debugging hell: Stepping into generated code? Not easy.
Hidden complexity: Lombok hides a lot of logic, making code less explicit.
It’s 2025 — we can do better.
Introduced in Java 14 and stable since Java 16+, record is a special kind of class that’s:
Immutable by default

In this blog, we'll address a common issue where you might be trying to change a CSS property like 'grid-template-columns' but are stuck due to unexpected behavior.
Understanding CSS Grid Properties
CSS Grid Layout is a powerful layout system that allows for complex designs. The property grid-template-columns is used to define the number and size of the columns in a grid layout. The unusual behavior you're encountering with grid-template-column stems from its singular and plural forms. The correct property to define column structure in grid layout is grid-template-columns, not grid-template-column. Understanding this distinction is crucial for successfully applying styles.

As you noted, when pressing Ctrl+C (which sends a SIGINT signal) multiple times in quick succession, only two signals get handled while additional signals seem to be ignored. This behavior can be perplexing to many developers. Let's dive into understanding why this happens and clarify the rules around signal queuing in Unix systems.
Understanding Signals in Unix
Signals are a crucial aspect of Unix operating systems that allow inter-process communication. They provide a way for processes to receive notifications about events like interrupts (e.g. SIGINT when you press Ctrl+C) or segmentation faults (e.g. SIGSEGV).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With 16.4k+ GitHub stars, SafeLine WAF redefines how web applications defend themselves. It doesn’t just block traffic—it reshapes it.
While traditional WAFs rely on static rules, SafeLine offers dynamic encryption, anti-crawler techniques, and scanner prevention, helping websites proactively defend against automated threats.

SafeLine encrypts static web content (like HTML and JavaScript) dynamically. Every page load results in a uniquely obfuscated version, frustrating crawlers and replay tools.
function vgo8rYXzpS() {
  var YIhUo91Nlh = 99.6174697329428;
  // Redundant logic + encrypted payload
  VdgkMuAloP("Z_GUlDIf7g");
}

The decryption logic runs in the browser—scraping tools fail to parse or reproduce the page correctly.
Python requests, Scrapy, Go HTTP clients see garbled code.
Search engine scrapers or site cloners end up with unreadable or broken pages.
SafeLine uses JavaScript validation and browser fingerprinting to separate bots from real users. When turned on, scanners like AWVS, Nessus, and others are blocked at the first request.

Each session gets dynamic tokens embedded in request parameters. Reusing or guessing these tokens results in immediate rejection and log alerts.
[WAF Log] Blocked request: /api/user?id=1' AND 1=1--
Attack Type: SQL Injection | Defense: Semantic Analysis + Token Validation


Instead of relying on a rule database, SafeLine inspects the behavior and context of a request. It has successfully blocked 98% of PHP deserialization 0day payloads with a false positive rate below 0.1%.
SafeLine transforms how web content is served and verified
Bots and scanners are neutralized before they even reach your application
Ideal for small-to-medium teams that want serious protection—without paying for an enterprise license
Ready to confuse your attackers?

In the next part, we’ll show how to deploy and test SafeLine in minutes—even against 30,000+ payloads.
Stay tuned.

The money laundering services were allegedly carried out on behalf of other criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking, Europol said in a May 14 statement.
Spanish authorities said the criminal organization ran a secret informal money transfer system called hawala and was often compensated in crypto.
A total of 17 individuals were arrested — 15 in Spain, one in Austria and one in Belgium — while 4.5 million euros ($5 million) worth of items were seized, including cash, crypto, 18 vehicles, four shotguns and several electronic devices.

“For some reason, founders and CEOs think that they should be raising capital at 50 to 80 times revenue. So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14.
“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.”

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin's all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”

Summer Mersinger, one of four commissioners currently serving at the US financial regulatory body Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will become the next CEO of the digital asset advocacy group the Blockchain Association (BA). 
In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would step down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2. Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the BA said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.

Despite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. 
Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Still, some industry observers remain cautious about the likelihood of near-term regulatory change.
“All three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment,”  Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of onchain data platform CryptoQuant, wrote in a May 14 X post.
Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investments are banned in South Korea, meaning that “100% [of the] volume comes from retail,” Ju added.
