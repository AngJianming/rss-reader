        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s recent all-time high may be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market in a development that may signal BTC’s growing recognition as a hedge against instability in the traditional financial (TradFi) system.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows.
While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

The term was first coined in 1955 by John McCarthy, a Dartmouth College computer scientist. Today, our everyday lives are drenched in AI, from large language models like ChatGPT to visual recognition features on phones and cameras, recommendation systems on Netflix and Spotify, Google Search, credit card fraud, self-driving cars, and more. It is literally everywhere.
Within the larger bucket of AI are several major areas, including:

In this post, let’s compare Redux and Zustand using a practical example: a simple counter app.
Redux is a predictable state container that uses a centralized store, actions, and reducers to manage application state. With the introduction of Redux Toolkit, a lot of the boilerplate has been reduced.
Zustand (German for "state") is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It’s created by the team behind Jotai and Recoil and is praised for being lightweight and incredibly simple to use.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a fundamental design pattern that plays a crucial role in modern software development. It helps decouple dependencies, enhances testability, and allows for flexible service management, making applications more scalable and maintainable.
In traditional programming, classes often instantiate their dependencies directly, leading to tight coupling and making it difficult to modify or test components. DI solves this problem by injecting dependencies externally, allowing components to work independently while promoting separation of concerns.
This article explores different ways to register services in DI containers, helping developers understand how dependencies are managed within an application. Whether you are building a simple console app, an AS…]]></summary>

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…]]></summary>

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. 
Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s “Bull Case” forecast. In a Feb. 11 video, Wood said the price would require BTC to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, largely fueled by increased institutional adoption.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors.

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) recorded $3.3 billion of inflows during the week ending May 24, bringing total inflows YTD to a record $10.8 billion, CoinShares reported on May 26.

On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns
US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president …]]></summary>

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
"This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.
