Remember when Googling something meant clicking through 10 tabs, skimming forum replies, and dodging SEO sludge?
I didn’t “quit Google,” but lately… I catch myself typing into ChatGPT way more than the search bar. And I’m not alone.
So what changed? And what does it say about where AI and search are headed?
Google used to be our oracle. You'd type a question and expect the internet to spill its guts.
Except what we got was often:
Ads up top
5-minute YouTube intros for a 30-second fix
SEO-driven blogs full of fluff and keywords
You learned to play the game:
CTRL + F for the answer
Skim aggressively
Open 5 tabs at a time and hope one gets to the point
It worked. Kinda. But it was slow, messy, and mentall…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're interested in automated testing, you might have seen some contradictory advice. For example, there's a well-known Test Pyramid, suggesting that we should focus mostly on unit tests. And there's another approach called Testing Trophy, which suggests that we should mostly write integration tests.

Some posts argue that unit tests are overrated, and others - that they're fine. Which advice should we follow? Choosing the right testing strategy isn't that simple, and the choice will have long-lasting consequences. Let's dive in.
People most commonly refer to unit, integration, and end-to-end tests—and those will be the focus of this post. Of course, this isn't the only way to categorize tests. You might also have come across terms like smoke, functional, system, or contract tests, eac…]]></summary>

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently using Ubuntu 24 TLS and have been following the official documentation to build Fuchsia OS. I have completed all the necessary steps for building the OS, and I did not encounter any errors during the build process.
However, when I attempt to start the emulator using the command ffx emu start, the emulator opens, but I can only see the Fuchsia system logo and the settings sidebar. Unfortunately, I am unable to interact with anything else within the emulator.
To troubleshoot, I have tried using a different laptop and ensured that all configurations are supported, but the issue persists. I am reaching out to see if anyone in the community has experienced a similar problem or has any suggestions on how to resolve this issue.
I have attached a screenshot link for your reference, which shows the current state of the emulator.

This high-performance Rust HTTP framework fundamentally altered my view of web development. Here's a genuine account of my experience learning and using Hyperlane.
ctx Abstraction


When I first began using Hyperlane, I was immediately impressed by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. In other frameworks, I was accustomed to writing more verbose calls, such as:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

With Hyperlane, this simplifies to a single line:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

This design significantly boosts code readability, especially when handling complex business logic, by removing the need for deeply nested method calls.

Over 70% of Malaysians now use at least one e-wallet. GrabPay, Boost, Touch ‘n Go, and MAE aren’t just convenient — they’re the default for many under-35 consumers. For merchants, integrating multiple e-wallets into one payment gateway is essential to prevent cart abandonment.

Data Science / AI / Machine Learning
Right now, I’m feeling a bit confused about how to start effectively and which core language I should stick with to avoid spreading myself too thin.
👨‍💻 What I already know:
Beginner-level coding in Python, Java, C, PHP
🧠 What I want to learn/do:
Data analysis, ML models, and AI apps
Build real-world projects, get internships, and eventually land a good job
❓ My questions:
Can I manage both Web Dev and AI/ML together in 2 years?
What would be a realistic 2-year roadmap to reach an intermediate level in both fields?
Any tips to build a strong portfolio while learning?
Thanks in advance! 🙏 I'd love any suggestions, roadmap links, course recommendations, or just general advice from those who’ve been in a similar spot.]]></summary>
