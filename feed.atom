        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do you guys remember those classic business game cards we used to play as kids? 
Suddenly, while exploring the Amazon Q game challenge, a wave of nostalgia hit me — why not recreate that fun digital version?
I took few minutes to build the entire game .
How We Used to Play
2 to 3 players (sometimes more!)
A board full of cities across India
We’d start by splitting the money we had
Roll the dice to move around the board
Buy cities when we landed on them
Pay rent if someone else owned the city
Encounter taxes, jail, lotteries along the way
And finally, the player with the most tickets (or assets) wins the game!
If you haven’t tried Amazon Q CLI yet, here’s a quick guide to get started:

Install Q CLI on your machine
Run q chat to start interacting
Build your favorite games or apps!
Why Amazon Q Developer CLI?
It’s a powerful tool that simplifies working in Linux environments, saving you time and boosting productivity. Plus, it’s fun to build interactive CLI games — like our classic business board game!
If you want to build Amazon Q CLI:
Here is the blog link on how I installed, and also attaching the podcast link on AWS MCP

In conclusion
As a UI Architect one common problem space I've noticed across teams and repos is how to organize network calls in web apps.
Without a plan in place, you are likely to naively just call axios or fetch from any random component, JS file, or global store. Or you may try moving all network calls into your global stores so at least there is some consistency and it gets them out of the components.
We tend to think of network calls as just a simple function that has two results (success/failure). This thought process can lead to underestimating the need for putting in the effort to organize them better. You may easily end up with a ton of network ca…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi devs 👋
After years of working on enterprise projects and constantly facing form-related challenges, I decided to build something I've always needed: an online form builder that actually works well for complex forms.
💡 FormSchema.com is my solution — a powerful, flexible, and developer-friendly form builder built for real-world use cases.
🧩 Why Another Form Builder?
Nested sections
Conditional logic
Dynamic fields
Multi-step wizards
Custom validation
Clean, maintainable integration with Angular, React, or plain HTML
So I built FormSchema to support all of that — and more — with schema-driven forms.
🔧 What Makes It Different?
Designed for Developers: JSON-based configuration, easy integration.
Handles Complex Forms: Need nested fields, repeatable groups, or dynamic logic? It’s got you covered.
Embeddable: Easily drop it into any site with a script tag.
Custom Components: Extend it with your own Angular or React components if needed.
Ionic Support: Works well in mobile hybrid apps too.
⚡ Quick Preview
Design a form with drag-and-drop or code view.
Add sections, logic, and validation.
Get a public URL or embed code.
Start receiving submissions immediately.
💻 Try It Out
FormSchema.com and let me know what you think. It’s free to use for now.
I’d love your feedback — especially if you deal with complex forms regularly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transit…]]></summary>

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” 
The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea is tightening rules around digital asset transactions as it prepares to allow institutional players into its crypto market, introducing new guidelines for nonprofit crypto sales and stricter listing standards for exchanges.
On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.
Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.
Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appro…]]></summary>

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take contro…]]></summary>

The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam.
“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”
