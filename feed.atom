I had a feeling that most of the devs that work with Apple Platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, etc) prefers SwiftUI over UIKit. I didn't found any data that proved this feeling, so I created a pool in LinkedIn, and that was the result:

This is not the most academic way to gather data, but it reveals that my feeling maybe is right: most of the devs prefers SwiftUI. Some of them, specially the most experienced ones, can argue about some pros and cons of SwiftUI and even scenarios where it should be avoided (mostly mention old OS support and team knowledge about the framework). However, I see a lot of engineers struggle to explain why they prefer SwiftUI. Sometimes it seems that they were told that SwiftUI is better, and they just accepted that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Looking to study, prototype, or structure a project with Micro Frontends (MF) in a modular and high-performance way?”
In recent days, I've delved into an experiment that can greatly simplify the lives of those working with micro frontends daily.
I created an open-source repository using:
Rsbuild: A modern and fast alternative to Webpack
Module Federation: To isolate and share components between apps
pnpm + Lerna: To orchestrate everything in a lightweight and organized manner
A simple yet powerful structure:
apps/mf_provider: exposes components
apps/mf_consumer: consumes via Module Federation
All running in parallel with pnpm dev



Check it out, and if you like it, drop a like or send some feedback!
👉 GitHub Repository
The pnpm package manager has a really cool feature called Catalogs. It allows you to define dependency versions as constants, which can then be reused inside the package.json of each internal module.
Example:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: "^18.3.1"
  react-dom: "^18.3.1"

In the internal modules, you can reuse the version defined in pnpm-workspace.yaml:
"dependencies": {
  "react": "catalog",
  "react-dom": "catalog"
}

Another cool thing is how practical Lerna makes it to set up a monorepo. It allows you to run multiple apps in parallel with a single command, like in the example below:
"dev": "lerna run --parallel dev"

Rsbuild + Module Federation turned out to be extremely simple to structure and understand, especially compared to using the plugin with Webpack.
In the next article, I’ll share an example using Vite, so we can get a practical comparison.
See you soon!

No one wakes up knowing how to code.


Even senior developers  Google simple things daily.


Progress > Perfection.




  
  
  🚀 What to Do When You’re Stuck


✅  Step Away for 10 Minutes  (Your brain solves problems better after a break.)

✅  Rubber Duck Debugging  (Explain your code out loud—even to a rubber duck!)

✅  Break It Down  (What’s the smallest part you  do  understand?)
📌  Free Resources for Help:
Stack Overflow  (Search before asking!)


MDN Web Docs  (Best for web dev)


The freeCodeCamp Forum  (Ask other dev's)







  
  
  💻 2. The Right Way to Ask for Help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?
Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.
Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…]]></summary>

XRP price is forming a bullish V-shaped recovery pattern targeting $3.40.

A 53% surge in open interest to $5.06 billion signals bullish sentiment.

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earned $250 million from its complete exit from crypto-friendly Nubank.

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based; Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

A report from enterprise-grade digital assets platform Fireblocks shows that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations.
The report, published May 15, surveyed 295 executives across traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies and payment gateways.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain gaming user activity dipped and funding slowed in April, but the overall ecosystem is healthier and maturing, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

Starknet added that the framework was the “gold standard onchain tool for analyzing Ethereum scaling solutions,” and said it achieved the milestone through changes such as creating a security council and censorship-avoidance mechanisms.

The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill, which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.
