In Part 2, I wrote about how I implemented authentication, next, I want to discuss errors, a rather ambiguous topic, especially challenging when the backend and frontend are developed separately. However, I already had my own plan and vision for how to implement this to make it as convenient as possible on both sides. The advantage is that I'm working alone and don't need to convince anyone else. So, let's begin.
The main issue is that some developers rely on status codes, while others always return a 200 code with is_success: true/false and include the error text in the body. I don't particularly like either approach because, over time, it all turns into spaghetti code, especially in large projects. The essence of the idea is to have an enum on the backend that clearly indi…]]></summary>

So firstly... What is XS?
XS acts as a bridge between Perl and C, allowing you to write subroutines in C and call them from Perl just like regular Perl functions. By offloading critical code to C, you can achieve significant performance improvements. XS also makes it possible to interface Perl with existing C libraries.
Next.. What is an perl Object?
A Perl object is simply a reference (usually to a hash, array, or scalar) that has been "blessed" into a package (class). This blessing associates the reference with a class, allowing you to call methods on it. Many of you will have writt…]]></summary>

We try to make those ideas a little more concrete and apply them to modelling some well-known distributed protocols.
The original post can be found here.
Designing, verifying, correctly implementing and later improving core mechanisms of complex distributed, decentralized systems, such as Byzantine fault tolerant consensus, is notoriously difficult and error-prone. One of the biggest challenges here is dealing with the inherently concurrent nature of distributed systems. So there is an underlying problem of structuring the inherently concurrent logic of distributed protocols that we don’t really know how to solve in a s…]]></summary>

If you regularly work with PDF documents, you've likely encountered situations where you need to compress not just one, but dozens or even hundreds of PDFs. Compressing files individually would be incredibly time-consuming and inefficient. Fortunately, batch compression solutions exist that can process multiple PDFs simultaneously, saving you valuable time while reducing storage requirements and improving sharing efficiency.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore various methods for batch compressing PDFs, from user-friendly online services to powerful desktop applications and automated workflows for enterprise needs.
Before diving into the how-to, let's consider why batch compression is so valuable:
