        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Docker has revolutionized the way developers build, ship, and run applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, mastering these essential Docker commands and tips will make you more efficient and productive.  
Before using Docker, ensure you have it installed by running:
docker --version

To get detailed system info, use:
docker info

Quickly run a container with:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-container nginx

This runs an Nginx server in detached mode (-d), mapping port 8080 on your machine to port 80 inside the container.  
To see all running containers:
docker ps

To include stopped containers:
docker ps -a

Stop a running container:
docker stop my-container

Remove a stopped container:
docker rm my-container

Remove all stopped containers at once:
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

Over time, unused images take up space. Remove them with:
docker image prune -a

If you have a Dockerfile, build an image with:
docker build -t my-app .

This tags the image as my-app.  
Use interactive mode to execute commands inside a running container:
docker exec -it my-container /bin/sh

For Ubuntu-based containers, use /bin/bash.  
Monitor logs with:
docker logs -f my-container

The -f flag shows real-time updates.  
Copy files from your local machine to a running container:
docker cp myfile.txt my-container:/app/

Copy files from a container to your machine:
docker cp my-container:/app/myfile.txt .

Instead of running multiple containers manually, define them in docker-compose.yml and start them with:
docker-compose up -d

Stop and remove all services:
docker-compose down

"Ever scrolled through a modern dashboard and thought, ‘Damn! This feels so fluid… how do they do that?’"
If you're a frontend developer in 2025, chances are you’ve asked yourself this at least once.
Animations have quietly become one of the most influential parts of the user experience. They’re no longer just about making things "look cool"—they guide the user, provide feedback, and elevate interaction into engagement.
In the early 2010s, animations were mostly afterthoughts—extra polish added at the end of a project if there was time. Today, they are baked into the design process from Day 1. With products competing for attention in milliseconds, smooth transitions, responsive feedback, and motion-based storytelling are the new UX fundamentals.

Hi
Two weeks ago I asked How do you deal with the decline in Perl-related jobs? and I received quite a few nice comments. Thank you! I'll have another question today.
Yesterday I asked in a Web 3 group how to get started with Web3, Blockchain, cryptocurrency, Ethereum.... I got a few suggestions including a link to the Blockchain Roadmap. So I checked. There is also a Python Roadmap and a Rust roadmap, but I have not found a Perl Roadmap. Not even a community created one. IMHO, if you are interested in making Perl easier to learn, more available and hopefully more popular than you might want to invest some time to create a community roadmap for Perl and maybe even to get it listed as an official roadmap.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent proposal that aims to change Bitcoin’s base unit to make it easier to understand as a payment tool has run into opposition, with critics saying Bitcoin’s satoshis are no more confusing than the dollar’s cents. 
Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A group of Coinbase users from Illinois have filed a class-action lawsuit against the crypto exchange, alleging that its identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).
Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

"You can't 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both."

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.

Details of companies, trusts and charities transacting on crypto platforms will also need to be reported.
Failure to comply or inaccurate reporting may incur penalties of up to 300 British pounds ($398.4) per user. The UK Revenue and Customs department said it would inform companies on how to comply with the incoming …]]></summary>

The syndicate was dismantled on May 15, resulting in the arrest of nine men and three women in mainland China and Hong Kong. 
The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17.
The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 re…]]></summary>

"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.
