“OKX also has consumers protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or an oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post.
OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either
Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,”  Xu said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a Bulletproof E2E Testing Strategy for User Authentication


Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).
What authentication edge cases have you found important to test? Let me know in the comments!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5 Automation Pitfalls That Slow Down Your Testing Cycle


Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

This isn't a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page's hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it's about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Syntax Example:
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subsection Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subsection</h3>

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6



Heading Tag
Typical Use Case
Importance Level




<h1>
Main page title
Highest


<h2>
Main section heading
High


<h3>
Subsection under an <h2>

Medium


<h4>
Subsection under an <h3>

Low


<h5>
Minor subsections, rarely used
Lower


<h6>
Least important section headings
Lowest

At our workplace, we operate multiple mini PCs in a remote location — each with 2 camera feed — and we needed to livestream them 24/7 to different platforms. The steps were tedious:
Manually open two OBS windows

Set up each RTSP stream

Apply AI detection filters (via obs-detect plugin)

Configure different RTMP destinations

Hit “Start Streaming” on both



Each time the PC was rebooted, all configurations had to be re-applied manually. Why initiate a reboot? To prevent thermal buildup and memory leaks—continuous 24/7 operation can lead to…]]></summary>

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Glover said that holding onto the BTC carries several benefits including, price appreciation, tax deferment, and the potential to make extra revenue by lending out BTC held in corporate treasuries. The executive added:
"If you are mining, you are generating all this Bitcoin. You understand the thesis behind Bitcoin and why it is likely going to continue to appreciate in the future. You do not want to sell any of your Bitcoin."

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.
In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse.

With creators and builders shifting focus and NFTs no longer selling like they used to, does the ZORA token drop symboliz…]]></summary>

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators.

Analyst predicts that a low VIX, specifically below 18, signals a risk-on market, which could potentially boost the Bitcoin price to $135,000 within the next 100 days.

The stablecoin market cap hits $220 billion, driving crypto liquidity and Bitcoin’s bullish price action.

A negative Bitcoin funding rate hints at a possible short-squeeze to $100,000.

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government is aiming for a 90% adoption rate among local merchants. The executive also told Cointelegraph:
"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion by: Chris Jenkins, adviser to Pocket Network
Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. 
It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Ether’s price has struggled in the first quarter of 2025, a US-based investment adviser firm, Two Prime, has dropped support for ETH and adopted a Bitcoin-only strategy.
After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP’s strongest spot premium phase suggests real buying demand, not just speculative futures trading. 

The number of XRP addresses holding ≥10,000 tokens has steadily climbed, even during recent price pullbacks. 

A falling wedge pattern points to a possible breakout toward $3 to $3.78, with up to 70% upside if confirmed.

XRP (XRP) is experiencing its strongest sustained phase of spot premium in history, a period where the spot market has been consistently trading at stronger levels compared to perpetual futures.
XRP’s 350% rally is backed by real demand  
Since 2020, most major XRP price peaks happened when the perpetual futures market was leading, noted market analyst Dom in his May 2 post on X.
