In this chapter, I'll walk through the setup of the Kubernetes cluster. For the Operating System (OS) of the nodes, I'll be using Talos. As mentioned earlier, the cluster will consist of three physical machines. Since Kubernetes uses a control-plane/worker model and we only have three nodes, each one will serve as both a control-plane and a worker. This setup allows workloads to be scheduled on all nodes while maintaining control-plane functionality.
Talos is a modern, minimalistic operating system designed specifically to run Kubernetes-and nothing else. It is immutable, meaning the OS is read-only and cannot be modified. This immutability improves security, making it more difficult for attackers to alter the system.
Talos is also built to be managed entirely via Kubernetes, simpli…]]></summary>

In Java programming, ensuring the integrity of data being inserted into a database is crucial. If your database is set to utf8 encoding, it limits you to characters within the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), specifically from U+0000 to U+FFFF. This means that characters beyond this range, such as emoticons and certain rare characters, will not be supported. To maintain this limit without switching to utf8mb4, it’s essential to validate the input data on the backend. In this article, we'll explore effective methods to perform this validation using regular expressions and Java code examples.
Why BMP Character Encoding Matters

You can use this article as a cheat sheet or a starting point to mastering the CLI.
The CLI is one of the most essential tools in a software engineer's toolbox. As useful as it is, it can feel a little intimidating for many developers (especially on the very first encounter). Others get excited. I remember seeing the terminal for the first time and thinking, "whoa, that looks super cool, I want to master it. NOW!"
But the CLI wasn't built to impress or scare anyone (especially not scare). It was designed to make our lives easier by providing the simplest form of interface possible. As developers, we should always strive for simplicity—our job is already hard enough without adding layers of unnecessary complexity.

Cloud-Provider Auth Services
AWS Cognito, Azure B2C, Google Identity Platform
Virtually free until very high volumes, but may lack out-of-the-box UI customization.
Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
Firebase Auth (free up to 50K users/month)
Supabase Auth
PocketBase (self-hosted)
SSOJet, Clerk.dev, Stytch, Kinde

All offer generous free tiers and modern SDKs
Self-Hosted Open-Source
Keycloak, Ory Kratos, Supertokens, Authgear
Full control and zero license fees, at the cost of hosting and maintenance overhead.
Build-Your-Own
Roll your own JWT-based login (e.g., using Passport.js or a simple email/password flow)
Simplest for very small scale but requires ongoing security diligence.
Scale & Budget: Calculate total cost at your expected growth, not just free-tier limits.
Feature Requirements: Do you need MFA, SSO/SAML, social logins, or multi-tenant support?
Maintenance Overhead: Self-hosting shifts burden to your team; hosted solutions offload ops at a price.
Vendor Lock-In: Check data export and migration paths—some providers don’t let you export password hashes.
Community & Support: A vibrant open-source community (Keycloak, Ory) or strong commercial SLAs (SSOJet, Clerk, Stytch) can save you headaches down the road.
By weighing cost, complexity, and required features, you can pick a path that fits both your technical needs and your wallet—whether that’s a serverless BaaS, a self-hosted IAM, or even a custom-built solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will introduce how to import Excel data into MySQL quickly and easily.
Here, we prepare an Excel table, as shown below:

Open the DiLu Converter tool and  create a new database connection firstly. Here we select MySQL database. For a detailed introduction to creating a new database connection, please refer to: Create a new database connection guide


After creating a new database connection, click New Import

Select the Excel file to be imported and click Start.


As you can see, the table fields created by the default are all of the varchar type, which makes the import speed as fast as possible and avoids import failures caused by inconsistency between data and data types.
We can also let the tool automatically detect data types . The advantage of this is that the field type can be more consistent with the actual data and make subsequent SQL queries more convenient.
Select Rebuild Mode - Select Auto Detect, and click Start to re-import

See again

We can save the import configuration so that we can repeat the import next time.

You can see the saved import in the object interface or under the database connection on the left

Next time you open the software, first double-click the connection name to open the connection - double-click the import name to open the saved import.

Just click to start

DiLu Converter is a powerful automated Excel import and export tool that supports more than 10 databases such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, Access, and Hive. The supported file formats include xls, xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, csv, txt, xml, json, and dbf. Its native user interface brings users a comfortable experience of simplified Excel import and export, making Excel import and export easier than ever before. Whether you want one-click, batch, and personalized import and export, or want to use scheduled tasks to achieve unattended full automation, DiLu Converter can bring you unprecedented productivity improvement.

Programs (smart contracts) are stateless and immutable.
Accounts store the state, data, and are passed into programs explicitly.
The runtime can process many transactions simultaneously—if they don’t touch the same accounts.

Speaking at a crypto conference in Toronto on May 15, Trump said that from families to government funds, “everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.” 
The remarks came during a panel at Consensus 2025. Sharing the stage with Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8, Trump said Bitcoin adoption has been incredible. 
“I'm traveling. I'm on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.”

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

"I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily," Nazarov said on May 14.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has reportedly fired a group of customer support agents following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. The contracted agents were based in India. 
According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.

Qiao Wang, a core contributor to Alliance DAO, said in a May 15 X post that he may have been a victim of one of these attacks. He said a scammer notified…]]></summary>

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks. To understand the potential impact on Bitcoin, let’s examine four key periods of significant spot ETF activity and their correlation with BTC pri…]]></summary>

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants.

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy.

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.

On May 15, blockchain data showed that Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), into the Tron network. 
As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s. 
In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion.

“What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”
New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value.

US Treasurys and foreign capital “repatriation” make a recipe for $1 million BTC, says Arthur Hayes.

Europeans face tightening capital controls, inviting a recommendation to take back control of personal funds.

Seven-figure BTC price targets are already gaining traction.

Bitcoin (BTC) will shoot to $1 million in just three years, thanks to global macroeconomic shifts, Arthur Hayes forecasts.
In his latest blog post released on May 15, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX doubled down on his sky-high BTC price prediction.
Hayes: $1 million Bitcoin due “between now and 2028”
Bitcoin has two strong tailwinds that will help propel it to seven digits in a few years.

At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos told CNBC he’s “selling MicroStrategy stock and buying Bitcoin.” The investor described the move as buying something for $1 and selling something for $2.50, referring to what he sees as a significant price mismatch.
Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.
Chanos said this was “ridiculous.” He described his trade as “a good barometer of not only just the arbitrage itself, but I think of reta…]]></summary>

According to a May 15 blog post, Coinbase said a group of external actors bribed and coordinated with several customer support contractors to access internal systems and steal limited user account data.
“These insiders abused their access to customer support systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers,” Coinbase said, adding that no passwords, private keys, funds or Coinbase Prime accounts were affected.
