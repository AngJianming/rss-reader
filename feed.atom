        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: AWS offers multiple services for decoupling business domains in event-driven patterns. The three main ones are EventBridge, SNS, and SQS. Use EventBridge for targeted content-based routing when you need to match complex rules. When multiple services or users need real-time notifications, SNS is a reasonable choice. Use SQS to buffer events when you want to protect downstream resources.

I’m Mohammad, a backend developer from Iran.
A while ago, I was working as a Node.js developer in a mid-sized company. Our APIs were growing, traffic was increasing, and bugs would appear in production at the worst possible times.
We tried monitoring tools like Prometheus, ELK, and others…
🔧 They were hard to set up.
So I started building my own platform – one that’s simple, backend-focused, and gives full control to the company without the headache.
🚀 Introducing Watchlog
Watchlog is a backend monitoring & APM platform – focused on logs, metrics, and performance.
It’s not a typical cloud SaaS or fully self-hosted app.
⚙️ Currently works with:
Node.js · Laravel · Django · Flask
💬 I’m looking for early feedback!
If you’re a backend dev or run a small team, I’d love to hear your thoughts.
🔗 Try the platform → https://watchlog.io
What features do you wish other tools had?
Let me know in the comments or DM. Thanks for reading 🙌]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Laravel Observers provide an elegant way to listen to Eloquent model events and execute code automatically when specific actions occur on your models. Think of observers as specialized event listeners that watch your models and react to changes like creation, updates, or deletions. This pattern helps you keep your models clean while centralizing related business logic in dedicated classes.
Imagine you have an e-commerce application where every time a user places an order, you need to send a confirmation email, update inventory levels, and log the transaction. Without observers, you might scatter this logic across your controllers, making your code harder to maintain and test. Observers solve this problem by providing a centralized location for model-related side effects.

  Historical and Technical Context


Memory management is a critical aspect of software development, particularly in environments where efficiency and resource management are quintessential. Prior to the advent of garbage collection, developers had to manually manage memory, which led to memory leaks and application crashes. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved subsequent to its introduction in 1995, with its memory management capabilities being augmented significantly. This evolution culminated in the introduction of WeakMaps and WeakSets with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), bringing forth the concept of weak references.
Weak references allow for referencing an object without preventing it from being garbage collected. This contrasts …]]></summary>

No artigo anterior, abordamos os conceitos básicos do padrão Outbox, que é uma estratégia usada em sistemas distribuídos para garantir que operações de banco de dados e mensageria sejam tratadas de forma consistente. Vimos como ele evita inconsistências causadas por falhas durante a publicação de eventos ou comandos, armazenando as mensagens em uma tabela de outbox antes de enviá-las ao broker de mensagens (ex: RabbitMQ).
A ideia principal é enviar um comando para criar um pedido (CreateNewOrder). Ao criar o pedido, serão publicados dois eventos: OrderPlaced e OrderPaid. Em caso de falha, nenhuma mensagem deve ser enviada.

In the last article, we explored the outbox pattern and a generic way to configure it. This time, we’ll dive into implementing the Outbox Pattern with SQL Server to guarantee transactional consistency between database updates and message publishing.
The main idea of this project is to send a command to create an order, when the order is create, it'll send 2 messages OrderPlaced & OrderPaid, in case we have a failure, we shouldn't send any message.

Ever wished you could get instant notifications in Microsoft Teams when someone tries to break into your server? I've got you covered! I recently created a solution that bridges Fail2Ban security monitoring with Microsoft Teams notifications, complete with geographical information about potential attackers.
As a system administrator, monitoring server security events can be challenging. Fail2Ban does an excellent job of detecting and blocking malicious activities, but by default, you only know about these events when you actively check the logs. What if you could get real-time notifications directly in your Teams workspace with detailed information about each security incident?
