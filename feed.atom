        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest—trust account audits aren’t exactly the highlight of an accountant’s year.
If you're managing funds on behalf of clients in your accounting practice—yes, you do.
It depends on when the account was opened.
If it was opened after 1 July 2011, the audit period is 12 months from the end of the month in which the account was opened.
The audit report must be completed within 3 months of the period end date. Don’t wait until the last minute—it’s one of the biggest traps firms fall into.
Check the Accountant Trust Account Audit Service
Not just anyone with “auditor” in their email signature.
Has a financial interest in your business.
Might be seen as lacking independence.
Even if the auditor ticks all the boxes technically, perceived conflicts of interest can still disqualify them.
It’s not something you want on your professional record.
audits?
Not separating trust funds properly: Mixing trust and operational funds is a big no-no.
Late audits: Procrastination is common, but it can backfire fast.
Poor record-keeping: If your files are all over the place, your audit will be too.
Using an ineligible auditor: This one catches a lot of firms off guard.
The key takeaway? Stay organised, stay on top of deadlines, and work with a qualified auditor who knows what they’re doing.
Here’s where it gets interesting.
It depends on your firm’s size, expertise, and bandwidth.
Trust account audits don’t have to be painful.
With the right planning, the right auditor, and a solid understanding of the rules, your firm can breeze through audit season without breaking a sweat. Knowing what to expect—and what can go wrong—is half the battle.
So whether you’re preparing your own audit or helping clients meet their compliance obligations, keeping this advice in your back pocket will save you stress, time, and possibly a call from your professional body.
Still unsure? Don’t wing it. Speak to an audit specialist early. A 10-minute chat now could save you weeks of hassle later.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Dev Community 👋
I'm reaching out to you as a dad in Dublin, raising an incredible autistic child who experiences the world in a truly unique way. Like many parents on this journey, I've found that getting support can be overwhelming and confusing.
Deciphering the HSE system, applying for SNA support, navigating carer’s allowance, or just finding the right professionals often feels like a full-time job. There’s no clear roadmap, and the process can leave you feeling lost, alone, or left behind.
That’s why I’ve started building www.spectrumconnect.eu with Lovable.dev — a free app designed for parents of autistic children. Here’s what it aims to do:
📆 Track important dates and applications (like SNA reviews or therapy appointments)
🗺️ Provide simple, guided steps to help families understand where they are in the process
🤝 Connect with trusted professionals
📑 Store and access important documents easily
💙 Most importantly, help parents feel seen and supported
I’m not a developer by trade — I’ve taught myself as much as I can, and I’m using Supabase as the backend. But now, I’m at the stage where I really need some experienced developer support to bring this vision fully to life.
Are you a developer who knows React, TypeScript, or Supabase?

Would you be willing to dedicate a few hours a week as a volunteer to help build something meaningful for families like mine?
This is a volunteer project. I’m committed to keeping it 100% free for parents — no ads, no fees, ever.
If this resonates with you, please DM me! After a chat, I’d be happy to invite you to the GitHub repo, Lovable.dev environment, or Supabase project — whatever’s most useful for you.
Thank you for reading, and for believing in a more supportive future for our children.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello friends 👋

In this blog, I will explain two simple and powerful tools in JavaScript: the AND (&&) and OR (||) operators. These are called logical operators and are used to check conditions.
Let’s understand them with examples that relate to real life 🚶‍♂️🍕💻
AND (&&)?


The && operator checks if both conditions are true ✅✅

If both are true → result is true

If any one is false → result is false ❌
Let’s say you want to go for a walk 🚶‍♀️

You will go only if:
➡️ It is not raining ☀️

AND

➡️ You have free time 🕒
let isNotRaining = true;
let hasFreeTime = true;

if (isNotRaining && hasFreeTime) {
  console.log("You can go for a walk! 🚶‍♂️");
} else {
  console.log("Stay at home! 🏡");
}

📌 If both conditions are true, the walk will happen

📌 If even one is false, no walk today!
OR (||)?


The || operator checks if at least one condition is true ✅

If one is true → result is true

If both are false → result is false ❌❌
You will order food 🍔 if:
➡️ You are hungry 😋

OR

➡️ There is no food at home 🍳
let isHungry = false;
let noFoodAtHome = true;

if (isHungry || noFoodAtHome) {
  console.log("Order food online! 🛵");
} else {
  console.log("No need to order food. Eat at home! 🍽️");
}

📌 Only one condition needs to be true to order food
➡️ && → Both conditions must be true ✅ AND ✅

➡️ || → Only one condition needs to be true ✅ OR ❌
let hasLaptop = true;
let hasInternet = false;

// Check if you can work from home
if (hasLaptop && hasInternet) {
  console.log("You can work from home 💻🏠");
} else {
  console.log("You can't work from home 😕");
}

// Check if you can still do something useful
if (hasLaptop || hasInternet) {
  console.log("You can still be productive! 💡");
}




Operator
Result is true if...




AND
Both conditions are true ✅✅


OR
At least one condition is true ✅ or ✅



I hope this blog helps you understand AND and OR operators in a fun and easy way! 😊

These are very helpful when writing conditions in JavaScript.
Thanks for reading! 💻🌟

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purge: A CLI Uninstaller for macOS That Goes Deep


Dragging apps to the trash on macOS leaves behind preferences, caches, and support files that waste space and can cause conflicts. purge (or prg) is a command-line tool that finds and removes all these hidden files.
Smart Detection: Extracts app identifiers from Info.plist files
Thorough Scanning: Searches all standard macOS system locations
Interactive Selection: Choose which files to keep or delete
Self-Contained: Single binary with no runtime dependencies
Coming Soon: Dry-run mode to preview without deleting
# Via Homebrew
brew tap wess/packages
brew install purge

# Or manually
git clone https://github.com/wess/purge.git
cd purge
npm install
npm run build:mac
ln -sf "$(pwd)/dist/prg-macos-$(uname -m)" /usr/local/bin/prg

https://github.com/wess/purge (throw a star!)



  
  
  Usage





prg /Applications/SomeApp.app

An interactive checklist appears with all related files. Uncheck items to keep, press Enter to trash the rest.
Options:
-n, --dry-run: Preview files without deleting (coming soon)
-h, --help: Show help information
Reads the app's metadata to find identifiers
Scans system folders where apps store their data
Matches files based on naming patterns
Displays all candidates for your review before deleting
Clean System: Recover space from hidden caches and support files
Prevent Conflicts: Avoid issues when reinstalling applications
Terminal Efficiency: Perfect for command-line workflows and scripts
Complete Control: See exactly what's being removed
purge is open-source on GitHub. Issues, feature suggestions, and pull requests are welcome!
What leftover app files are hiding on your Mac? Try purge and let us know what you discover!]]></summary>

GoFlux is designed to bring developer happiness through smart defaults and automation. From automatic route generation to pre-built configurations, GoFlux helps you focus on writing business logic — not boilerplate.

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

Bitcoin exchange volume delta becomes a key ingredient in assessing the staying power of BTC price breakouts, per analysis from CryptoQuant.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

According to a Bloomberg report, Infinite Risks International, a private security firm based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, is seeing more inquiries into bodyguard services and more long-term clients signing up for a private security detail.
Additionally, French law enforcement officials recently announced enhanced security measures for crypto entrepreneurs and investors, following at least three separate kidnapping incidents so far in 2025.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.
