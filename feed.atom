The fastest way is to use crt.sh
$ curl -s <https://crt.sh/\\?q\\=%25.example.com\\&output\\=json> \\
| jq '.[] | [ .common_name, .name_value ] | .[]' -r \\
| sort -u \\
| grep -v -E " |@"

*.example.com
dev.example.com
example.com
m.example.com
...

This method is good because it instantly gives information on the basis of issued certificates and does not work aggressively

Dozens of other resources can act as a source, and in order not to address each resource individually you need to use the subfinder application , which allows you to configure integration with multiple sources

The list of all possible sources subfinder -ls : 

It remains to find out which domains are valid, just run cat d.txt | dnsx:

Note - on screenshot the command head, because example.com is not the most comfortable example to search for subdomains and I found 22705 domains 🫠
Okay, so we found domains, what next?
Check if it is alive, in this utility will help httpx:

It is also able to create screenshots, which helps to visually evaluate the finds 😉

I'll post a couple more ways in the future, right now it’s enought for most cases
Anyway, it's all a good start, install the utilities with a special installer https://github.com/projectdiscovery/pdtm (just run pdtm -ia after to receive all tools)]]></summary>

They’ve integrated a fresh proof verification flow to support Proxy mode, one of three major zkTLS architectures (MPC, TEE, Proxy).
Oasis RNG is now public on Sapphire Mainnet.
The privacy-preserving, no-code automation platform Otomato is rolling out to test devs.
The Runtime Offchain Logic framework (ROFL) got a test harness, better cache control, and expanded system call support.
The Oasis team also improved local development tools for remote attestation — essential for proving apps and agents are running inside untampered TEEs.
If you’re building privacy-first dApps, confidential agents, or even DeFi automation, Oasis is clearly leading the pack in Web3 infrastructure that’s both powerful and responsible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wondered how complex games, apps, and websites are built so efficiently? It all comes down to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)!
Here is how it happens:
Object-Oriented Programming is a method of writing code using real-life concepts like objects, properties, and actions.


OOP uses four powerful principles: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism, to organize code smartly.


It helps make your code cleaner, more reusable, and easier to understand for teams and solo developers alike.


OOP is used in most popular languages like Python, Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript and it powers everything from school apps to global games.


Despite a few limitations like complexity and memory use, OOP remains the best way to model real-world systems in code.



Start learning OOP today and unlock a smarter way to build powerful, real-world applications!

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

Desenvolver software atualmente é uma tarefa cada vez mais desafiadora: as aplicações estão mais complexas e a pressão por entregas rápidas (e sem bugs!) só aumenta. É nesse cenário que entra o StackSpot.
O StackSpot funciona como um “hub” central onde você e seu time podem organizar, padronizar e compartilhar tudo o que precisam para criar aplicações modernas: desde componentes de código até automações e boas práticas. Ele acelera o desenvolvimento e garante qualidade do início ao fim — da primeira linha de código até o deploy em produção.

Here are the main advantages of ADR compared to MVC:
1. Better Domain Separation and Application Structure
ADR was originally designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles in mind, which allows better structuring of the application by domains rather than by component types (controllers, models, views). As a result, the code structure becomes more logical and focused on business goals rather than technical layers.


In MVC, you often end up with many folders full of controllers and mixed responsibilities, whereas ADR suggests grouping code by meaning and purpose, which makes maintenance and scaling easier.

A generator is a special type of iterable, like a list or a tuple, but instead of returning all items at once, it yields one item at a time — only when requested.

In Linux, permissions and ownership don’t stop at just the user — groups play a big role in shaping how access is granted across teams, services, and departments. And that's where chgrp comes in.
If you’ve ever wondered how to efficiently manage team collaboration or lock down sensitive files with shared group access — this is the command you’ll want to master.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the former CEO of crypto exchange Binance, said most European countries were moving “nowhere” in terms of the adoption of digital currencies.
Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thinking person, leader. But other than Montenegro, I don’t have any other, it’s kind of missing on the map.”
Zhao, who has a home in Dubai, resigned as Binance CEO in November 2023 as part of a plea deal with US authorities pursuing charges against the exchange. Since leaving Binance and serving four months in prison in the US, he has become more involved with his educational platform, Giggle Academy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points: 

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto was born from an open-source ethos, where code was shared publicly, accessible for review and shaped by community contributions. Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.
But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

Hackers made off with $92 million of digital assets across 15 incidents in April, according to an April 30 research report by blockchain cybersecurity firm Immunefi.
The total marks a 124% month-over-month increase from March, when hackers stole $41 million.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mantra has called for industry-wide cooperation to reduce investor risks in the aftermath of its OM token crash.
On April 30, Mantra published its latest update since the sudden collapse of its OM token, claiming that the incident was “bigger than Mantra.”
“Liquidation cascades could happen to any project in the crypto industry,” Mantra CEO John Mullin warned in the post, pointing to the role of “aggressive leverage positions” on exchanges as a broader threat to investor safety.

Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price over time, which indicates the uncertainty about the size of changes in an asset’s value.
Bitcoin (BTC) weekly volatility hit a 563-day low on April 30, said Vetle Lunde, the head of research at K33 Research.

Bitcoin’s supply-and-demand dynamics, in addition to growing institutional adoption, position it as a potential hedge against inflation in 2025. However, its high volatility and centralization concerns mean it remains a speculative asset rather than a guaranteed safeguard against inflation.
What is inflation? 
Inflation refers to the general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. As prices rise, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Inflation is typically measured by indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average change in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods an…]]></summary>

Set up your Pi Wallet and secure it with a 24-word seed phrase before transferring your coins.

KYC is often required on both CEXs and P2P platforms to transfer and sell Pi Coins.

You can sell Pi through CEXs or P2P platforms, each offering different security, speed and control.

Always do your own research (DYOR) before selling or holding, as expert opinions on Pi’s future vary.

If you’re here, you probably already know what Pi Coin is and just want to figure out how to sell it. However, a recap awaits, in case you need one. 
While the project pitches itself as a way to democratize crypto access through mobile mining, there are some major concerns that have been hard to ignore:

Bitcoin's 28% rebound from $75,000 faces resistance at $95,000, risking a bull trap.

Strong spot price momentum and ETF inflows support a potential $100,000 push.

Bull flag pattern suggests a $108,300 target if BTC breaks the $95,000 resistance.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 28% from its five-month low below $75,000 reached on April 9. However, its failure to break above the $95,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the latest recovery may trap bulls.

Approving staking for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may have a minimal impact on inflows unless Ether sees a sustained rally, says Eric Balchunas

ETH dropped significantly in price after the launch of the ETFs last year, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw new all-time highs just two months after launching.

Balchunas said that for inflows to increase again, ETH would need a multimonth run and a strong narrative.

Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token’s price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.
Balchunas said on an April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast that staking being approved for Ether (ETH) ETFs would have “a little”…]]></summary>

PayPal said in an April 29 regulatory filing that the SEC concluded its investigation into PayPal USD (PYUSD) and wouldn’t be taking any action.
The company said it received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement over its stablecoin in November 2023. 
“The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request,” PayPal stated at the time.
In its latest filing, the firm said the SEC notified it in February that the agency “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.”
PayPal has said its stablecoin is 100% redeemable for US dollars and “fully backed” by dollar deposits, including short-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has filed lawsuits against the non-fungible token marketplace NFT Stars and the blockchain gaming firm Kurosemi, which operates as Delysium, accusing them of withholding tokens they owed.
The lawsuits, both filed in the Delaware bankruptcy court, alleged that NFT Stars and Delysium failed to deliver all the tokens paid for by FTX despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter.
FTX claimed in an April 28 statement that it made “numerous unanswered attempts” to engage with both firms, and it would be “contacting numerous other token and coin issuers regarding FTX assets and will be filing additional suits against non-responsive parties.”

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash.
BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.”

Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman said in an April 28 judgment that OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” sanctions.
Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.
“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.
