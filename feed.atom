In agile development, where speed meets scale, one chart silently powers strategic decisions behind major feature rollouts and product releases—the Epic Burndown Chart.
For developers working across multiple sprints or contributing to large-scale features, the Epic Burndown Chart is more than a reporting tool; it’s a window into the project’s soul. 
This blog is your in-depth guide to understanding, creating, and mastering epic burndown charts in a way that resonates with developers, engineers, and tech leads.
An Epic Burndown Chart visualizes the progress of work associated with an epic—a large body of work broken down into smaller user stories—over multiple sprints. Unlike a sprint burndown chart that covers a 1–2 week timeframe, an epic burndown spans several iterations …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you landed an interview for a data engineering role — congrats! 🎉 But now comes the big question: how do you make sure you don’t mess it up?
Interviews can be tricky, especially for data engineering where there’s a mix of technical skills, problem-solving, and even some soft skills involved. I’ve seen lots of candidates stumble on a few common things, so here’s a quick rundown of mistakes you want to avoid — and what you can do instead to crush your interview.
Skipping the Basics (Yeah, That Means SQL Too)
You might be excited to talk about Apache Spark or Kafka, but if you can’t confidently write solid SQL queries or explain basic data modeling, it’s going to show.
What to do:
Not Really Knowing Your ETL/ELT Process
Sometimes candidates get lost in fancy tools but forget to explain how data actually flows from raw sources to clean, usable datasets.
What to do:
Data Warehousing Confusion
If you can’t explain what a data warehouse is or how it’s different from a data lake, interviewers will wonder if you really get the fundamentals.
What to do:
Forgetting Data Engineering Also Has System Design
System design isn’t just for software engineers — data engineering interviews often include it, too!
What to do:
Ignoring Behavioral Questions
Believe it or not, how you communicate and handle real-world problems matters just as much as technical skills.
What to do:
Talking Tools Without Business Context
Interviewers want to know you’re not just a tech wizard, but someone who understands why your work matters.
What to do:
Surface-Level Cloud and Big Data Knowledge
Cloud platforms and big data tools are huge in data engineering now, but shallow knowledge won’t impress.
What to do:
Bonus Tip: Practice, Practice, Practice
Wrapping Up
Remember, interviewers want someone who can solve data problems and explain how it impacts the business. Be that person — you got this! 🚀]]></summary>

This unyielding sentinel, imbued with the strength of Thor’s hammer and the cunning of Loki’s tricks, shields Midgard’s gadgets from the wrath of overheating chaos. Let us unveil why this metallic titan is the unsung hero of Asgardian-grade electronics.

Chapter 1: The Forging in Svartalfheim
Heat Sink is no mere mortal metal. Crafted by the Dwarven Smiths of Svartalfheim, it channels three primordial forces:
Mjölnir’s Might: Copper cores conduct heat like lightning summoned by Thor’s strikes.
Why frost giants fear it:
Passive Cooling: As futile as Baldur’s attempts to dodge fate.
Chapter 2: The Nine Realms of Cooling
Midgard’s LED Lights:
Heat sinks guard LED bulbs in mortal homes, banishing heat like Heimdall wards off invaders. “Let no dimming plague this realm!”
Jötunheim’s Electric Chariots:
Shield Tesla batteries from Muspelheim’s flames, steadier than Sleipnir’s gallop.
Alfheim’s Healing Scrolls (Medical Tech):
Cool MRI machines with the precision of Idunn’s apples, preserving life’s fragile balance.
Asgard’s Star-Forged Tech:
Radiation-hardened sinks protect Mars rovers, defying cosmic fires like Tyr’s courage defies chaos.

The Runes of Thermal Mastery
Algiz (Protection): 0.1°C/W resistance – a shield against Ragnarök’s heat.
The Treachery of Laufey’s Brood
Cheap Imitations: Overheat like Fenrir’s rage, melting circuits into primordial ooze.
The Prophecy of the All-Father
circuits of men. Its fins shall spread like Yggdrasil’s branches, and its core shall endure as Mjölnir’s steel.”
Epilogue: The Twilight of Overheating

POSIX digunakan untuk menjamin kompatibilitas di antara sistem-sistem seperti Unix. Jika sebuah program atau sistem operasi sudah sesuai dengan standar POSIX, anda dapat mengharapkan skrip bash dapat berjalan diatasnya.

POSIX juga menjamin bahwa anda akan memiliki akses ke daftar utillitas, termasuk diantaranya cat, awk, cut, grep, dan kill, hanya untuk menyebut beberapa. 

Standar ini juga mendefinisikan bagaimana utillitas yang disebutkan tersebut harus berperilaku. Pada masa lalu, beberapa utillitas memiliki implementasi yang saling bersaing sehingga menciptakan masalah dalam portabilitas.
Beberapa artikel membahas tentang:
Kesadaran bahwa sistem operasi pada mesin target merupakan hambatan yang sama besarnya terhadap portabilitas seperti arsitektur perangkat kerasnya, membawa kami pada saran yang tampaknya radikal, untuk menghindari bagian masalah itu secara keseluruhan dengan memindahkan sistem operasi itu sendiri.

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill, which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.

There hasn't been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, liquidating all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. 
The more than 6 million IBIT shares are worth around $355.6 million at current prices.
SWIB was one of the first state investment funds to provide Bitcoin exposure to US retirees when it bought $164 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 — the same quarter the Bitcoin products launched.

Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been “hiccups” in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. 
Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

Bitcoin's 36% rebound from $74,500 runs into resistance at $106,000.

Bid-side liquidity is staking up on the downside near $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 36% from its April 9, five-month low at $74,500. However, its failure to decisively break above $106,000 has sparked concerns about whether a sharp correction is possible in the coming days.

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase's chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. 
The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks.

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…]]></summary>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…]]></summary>

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.
