        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever needed to clean up a project directory but didn’t want to lose your hidden files or the all-important README.md?


Let’s talk about a simple, safe, and powerful command-line trick to do just that — using find.
Say you’ve built and compiled several binaries, created temporary files, or generated test outputs. You want to wipe everything except:
Hidden files (e.g., .git, .env, .gitignore)
README.md
But using something like rm * will delete almost everything — and it won’t touch hidden files, which can be misleading. You need a smarter, safer approach.
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.*' ! -name 'README.md' ! -name '.' -exec rm -rf {} +


find . -maxdepth 1: Only search in the current directory (not recursively).
! -name '.*': Don’t touch hidden files/directories.
! -name 'README.md': Keep your documentation safe.
! -name '.': Prevent deleting the current directory.
-exec rm -rf {} +: Delete everything else — files and folders.
Before:
$ ls -al
calculator  calculator.c  func  func.c  hello  hello.c  ...
.git  .gitignore  README.md


After:
$ find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.*' ! -name 'README.md' ! -name '.' -exec rm -rf {} +
$ ls -al
.git  .gitignore  README.md


Before running rm -rf, test the output with:
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.*' ! -name 'README.md' ! -name '.' -exec echo {} +


This prints the files that would be deleted.
Finally run:
find . -maxdepth 1 ! -name '.*' ! -name 'README.md' ! -name '.' -exec rm -rf {} +]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is the scripting language that brings interactivity to your websites. One of its most powerful features is the ability to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)—essentially the structure of your HTML—using variables.
In this blog, we'll break down:
•What variables are in JavaScript
•How they interact with HTML through the DOM
•Examples of how to use them effectively
🧠 What Are JavaScript Variables?
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that you can use later in your code. Think of them as labeled containers for values like numbers, strings, or even entire HTML elements.
Declaring Variables
🌿 Introduction to the DOM
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure created by the browser from your HTML. It lets JavaScript read and manipulate elements on the page.
Here’s a simple HTML example:
Welcome!
In this example, JavaScript can access and change the 
 element using the DOM.


🛠️ Using Variables to Change the DOM
Let’s write the script.js:
function changeTitle() {
•newTitle is a variable storing the new message.
•document.getElementById("title") accesses the 
 element by its ID.


•innerText = newTitle updates the content of the 
.


🔄 Dynamically Changing Styles
You can also use variables to change styles:
function changeColor() {
 text color to blue when the function is called.


🚀 Conclusion
Next Step: Try building a simple form or interactive quiz using what you’ve learned. It’s a great way to solidify your understanding!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Personally I hate FAQs. I think they are a lazy way of presenting content. They are a black hole of information, with zero information scent and no context. 
So it was really disappointing to find out that AI likes (even prefers) content in that format. A question with an answer. I get that LLMs like tight info relationships, but understanding those relationships in multiple contexts is AI's job. Providing the best smelling info scent is the mission. So why do I need to dumb down my content for AI?
There's this thing now called AEO and it's like SEO but for AI models. AI is more likely to surface the content that you write, if it's in a format AI likes to digest. FAQs are like cheese on toast apparently. Delicious and quick to make.
Forgive me if I have higher expectations of our new robot overlords. The content I make is structured, clear, well-expressed, mildly spiced, and made for every palate, human palates especially. 
If we feed AI the same thing all the time, it's going to regurgitate the same back on us. And is never going to "learn" to get its nutrition from variety of foods. So if you see the terms "AEO" or "AIEO" don't believe the hype. Feed your AI a balanced diet, and not bread all the time.]]></summary>
