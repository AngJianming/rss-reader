C++ has always been the king of performance, but modern systems demand more: concurrency, scalability, and maintainability. Traditional threading models with mutexes and locks are notoriously difficult to get right. What if you could write highly parallel C++ code that is both safe by design and incredibly fast?
Enter qb, a C++17 framework built on the Actor Model and asynchronous I/O. It's designed from the ground up to leverage multi-core architectures, making complex concurrency patterns feel simple and intuitive.

Welcome to context switching—the silent productivity killer that costs IT companies an average of $50,000 per developer each year.

What Is Developer Context Switching?


Context switching occurs when developers shift attention between different tasks, projects, or mental frameworks. Unlike computers that switch contexts in nanoseconds, human brains need significant time to rebuild complex mental models.
