Point the Subdomain to Your Contabo Server (DNS Settings)



  
  
  On your domain registrar (where you bought mydomain.co.ke):



Go to the DNS settings or Manage DNS section.
Create an A Record for api-subdomain:
Type: A


Name: api-subdomain


Value: Your Contabo public IP


TTL: Default or 300 seconds
üìù It may take up to 10‚Äì30 minutes for DNS to propagate.
Install Required Packages on Contabo (Ubuntu)





sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv nginx git
pip install gunicorn

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes can feel overwhelming at first , all the YAML, pods, deployments, services... But once you deploy your first app, things start to click.
In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through deploying a simple Nginx web server to a Kubernetes cluster, using just a few YAML files.
We‚Äôll use:
A Deployment ‚Äì to manage our pods
A Service ‚Äì to expose our app
Optionally, a NodePort ‚Äì to access it from a browser
Let‚Äôs create a deployment to run two replicas of the nginx container.
File: nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.25
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Apply it:
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

Check status:
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods

To make the app accessible, define a Service.
File: nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort

Apply it:
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml

Check the port:
kubectl get svc nginx-service

Look for the NodePort, e.g., 30007.
If you're using Minikube:




minikube service nginx-service

If you're using Docker Desktop or a cloud cluster:
Open http://<NODE-IP>:<NODE-PORT> in your browser.
To delete the resources:
kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml

You just:
Created a Kubernetes deployment for Nginx
Exposed it using a service
Accessed it via browser or CLI
Learned the basics of kubectl and YAML syntax
Try:
Replacing Nginx with your own app image
Using ConfigMaps or Secrets for configuration
Exploring Ingress controllers
Scaling your deployment with kubectl scale

An Evil Twin Attack is a type of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack where a malicious actor creates a fake Wi-Fi access point (AP) that mimics a legitimate Wi-Fi network's name (known as Service Set Identifier or SSID for short) and appearance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase‚Äôs contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors ‚Äî subsequently fired ‚Äî ‚Äúabused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement‚Äôs pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,‚Äù said Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though ‚Äúno passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed‚Äù according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase‚Äôs stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported ‚Äúverified user‚Äù numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Circle is seeking at least $5 billion, which is its target for the IPO, according to the four banking and private equity sources Fortune cited. Ripple tried to purchase Circle on April 30, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low.

If Ripple or Coinbase were to buy Circle, the details of a purchase would differ. Ripple would pay using cash and XRP (XRP), a cryptocurrency that Ripple created. Coinbase, on the other hand, would use cash and stock.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin‚Äôs current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

Zand Bank, the UAE‚Äôs first all-digital bank, and Mamo, a fintech company that offers a digital payment platform for businesses, will be the principal users of the blockchain payments system, according to a May 19 Ripple announcement.

Zand Bank and Mamo will use ‚ÄúRipple Payments‚Äù to facilitate cross-border blockchain payments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody‚Äôs recent downgrade of US debt.

Moody‚Äôs downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.

Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an ‚Äúimportant level‚Äù as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin‚Äôs surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply clus‚Ä¶]]></summary>

At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016‚Äì2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.
