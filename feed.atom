However, one of their bigger downsides is the lack of accurate parse error reporting. Let's take a look. Suppose you want to parse records of this format: 1 Bob ie an ID number followed by one or more spaces, followed by an alphabetic word (a name). Here's a basic Angstrom parser for this:
open Angstrom

type person = { id : int; name : string; }

let sp = skip_many1 (char ' ')
let word = take_while1 (function 'A' .. 'Z' |'a'..'z' -> true | _ -> false)

Instead of loading all elements of a page on initial load, lazy loading allows the browser to only load elements that are visible to the user, saving bandwidth and speeding up page load times.
As users increasingly rely on mobile devices and sometimes slower internet connections, site performance becomes crucial for user experience. One of the easiest ways to improve performance is by using lazy loading for images or other elements that are not immediately visible on the page.
One way to implement lazy loading is by using the Intersection Observer API, which provides an efficient way to detect when elements come into the user's viewport.

When most developers think of Git, version control comes to mind. But beneath its porcelain surface lies a powerful, content-addressable file system designed with immutability, integrity, and efficiency in mind. This post peels back the layers to explore Git as a content management system, powered by cryptographic hashing and a robust object model.
At the core of Git is content-addressability—a paradigm where content is identified and retrieved using a SHA-1 hash, not a filename.
“If two pieces of content are the same, Git ensures they are stored once—immutably and efficiently.”
This design guarantees:
Uniqueness: Identical content results in identical hashes.
Integrity: Any mutation alters the hash and creates a new object.

One common use case is the contenteditable attribute, which allows users to edit text directly in a block element. In this article, we'll address a specific challenge: how to change the color of certain characters while still allowing users to type freely in a contenteditable div.
Understanding the Problem
The issue arises from the way you are manipulating the inner HTML of the contenteditable div. When you use innerHTML to replace characters with styled <span> elements, it effectively refreshes the entire content of the div, causing the cursor position to reset and leading to a frustrating user experience. This can also prevent users from typing, as they may lose their current input context.…]]></summary>

In machine learning, a model represents the learned state of an algorithm after training on data; in other words, the algorithm defines the process (e.g., neural networks), and the model is the set of parameters adjusted from the data. Different models are suited for different tasks, and complex systems may combine multiple models (ensembles) to improve accuracy. Generally, we distinguish between supervised (labeled data), unsupervised (pattern discovery), and reinforcement learning (reward-based agents).

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from President Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. 
“People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the …]]></summary>

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.
