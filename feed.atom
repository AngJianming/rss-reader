I have this WIP pull request in motion if you want to follow along. It's just a draft with some stuff to be worked out.

But nestled in the Village of Rosemont, just outside the city, lies another emblem of Chicago's layered complexity. The community that built the Village of Rosemont converted a factory and warehouse into what is today one of the most successful convention and tradeshow facilities in the U.S.A. It's here, in this logistical heartland of America, that PHP TEK 2025 unfolded. 
This year marked the 17th installment of the premier event of the year for PHP enthusiasts, web development professionals, and companies. Over 150 members of the PHP community got together for three days of sessions, workshops, and a lot of honest conversations on where we are going with web application development.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be real: AI is everywhere in language learning right now, but most of it is lipstick on a broken system.
Apps love to say “powered by AI” but what does that actually mean? Usually:
A glorified chatbot that barely listens
Auto-translation features you could get with Google
Speech feedback that tells you nothing useful
Static lesson plans with no adaptive logic
They’re not solving the core problem: getting you confident in real conversations. The AI is passive—reactive at best. It doesn’t push you. It doesn’t correct you in meaningful ways. It doesn’t feel like you're speaking to someone who cares if you get fluent.
At YAP, we’re doing it differently:
AI conversation partners simulate real humans and nudge you out of your comfort zone.


Feedback focuses on communication success, not robotic perfection.



Your effort = rewards. Our system pays you in $YAP for showing up and speaking. Rewarding you for your effort and time.
Good AI should feel like a partner, not a gimmick. It should make fluency faster, funnier, and a little bit uncomfortable—in the best way. 
The future of language learning isn’t just AI—it’s AI with incentives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In tech, we talk a lot about interfaces. How users interact. How systems are separated by clean abstractions.
We build our digital selves like we build UIs. Deliberately curated. Versioned. Deployed.
But underneath all that, there is still the raw protocol. The human. The anxious. The tired. The trying.
Some borders are not drawn in code. They are inherited in silence.
This reflection explores this in a more poetic way. It touches on how identity becomes signal. How ego replaces empathy. How the space between people can start to feel like a firewall. Not political. Just honest.
If you have ever felt visible but not seen, or competent but still questioned, this might resonate.
It is not about fixing it.
It is about noticing when it starts to feel like part of the architecture.]]></summary>

Regular expressions in Ruby represent one of the most powerful text processing capabilities available to developers. While many tutorials cover basic pattern matching, this comprehensive guide delves into advanced techniques, performance optimization strategies, and sophisticated use cases that push the boundaries of what's possible with Ruby's regex engine.
Ruby's regex implementation is built on the Onigmo library (a fork of Oniguruma), providing extensive Unicode support, advanced features, and excellent performance characteristics. This article explores the depths of Ruby's regex capabilities, from meta-programming with dynamic patterns to building complex parsers and analyzers.
Ruby's regex engine is based on Onigmo, which provides several key advantages:

Ever wanted to build something on the blockchain but felt overwhelmed by all the jargon? Yeah, me too. That’s why I decided to start small, real small with a fun little project: a "Buy Me a Coffee" dApp where people can send me ETH as a tip. (Because, let’s be honest, we all need more coffee and crypto in our lives.)
This was my first full-stack Web3 project, and let me tell you. It was a wild ride. From wrestling with TypeScript to debugging weird MetaMask errors, I learned a ton. And now, I’m here to break it all down for you in a way that (hopefully) doesn’t make your brain melt.
So grab your favorite drink (coffee, tea, or… ETH?), and let’s dive in!
☕ What the Heck Does This dApp Do?

That’s exactly what this dApp does. It’s a super simple Ethereum-based tip …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a developer isn’t just about writing code.
Learning new frameworks
Building side projects
Balancing school, work, or life
Trying to stay sane 😅
And if you’re working solo… it hits different.
🧩 “You’re the Developer, the Designer, the PM… and the Janitor.”
You come up with an amazing idea. You start building it with full energy.
Then life happens:
🎓 You’ve got exams.

📁 Welcome to the “Unfinished Projects” Graveyard
That productivity app you started?
That AI-powered tool you built 80% of?
That portfolio redesign that looked 🔥 but still says “Coming Soon”?
They’re sitting in a folder. You swear you’ll finish them “soon.”
Every developer has that folder.

💭 So… Why Are We Doing This Alone?
What if we:
Paired up with others in the same boat?
Shared unfinished ideas and built them together?
Had spaces where devs could jump in and contribute, no judgment?
Imagine an ecosystem where developers hand off projects like relay runners, instead of dropping the baton when life gets hectic.
🧪 Real Talk From Me
I was building an AI-powered README Generator.
Now it sits there, waiting.
And I can’t help but think — if another dev saw the value in it, why not let them take it across the finish line?

🤝 Maybe It’s Time We Collaborate More
Sharing half-done projects
Asking for help before burnout
Building with people, not just for people
It doesn’t make you less of a developer — it makes you a smarter one.
✍️ P.S. I might open-source my README Generator soon. If AI + productivity is your jam, ping me.
🧠 What About You?
💬 Drop your thoughts in the comments:
What stops you from finishing projects?
Is it burnout? Impostor syndrome? Overwhelm?
Do you struggle with motivation, feedback, or just too many ideas?
Let’s build a thread of real, raw dev problems — and maybe we can find solutions together.
🗣️ Let’s Start Something Together
And who knows? We might just start something awesome together.]]></summary>

“The best way to learn is to build. The smartest way to build is to ask questions.”
It’s 2025 — and the tools available to beginner developers have never been better. Whether you're building your very first webpage or brushing up on the basics, you don’t have to do it alone.
With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can bring your ideas to life on the web. And now, with AI by your side, the learning process becomes more powerful than ever before.
It’s tempting to skip ahead to shiny frameworks and drag-and-drop tools. But if you want:
Confidence in your code,


Creative freedom,


The ability to debug and build from scratch…



…then learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the foundation that will carry you through your entire dev journey.

Now, it's time to build out the server-side infrastructure to handle these uploads effectively. In this tutorial, we'll create a backend system that not only receives and stores images but also manages their metadata and serves them back to our application. We'll cover setting up file storage, integrating with a database to track image information, and creating endpoints that return essential image data like storage locations. Let's dive into building a complete image management system with Node.js.
So, what is the idea? Ok, we will create a separate route that will accept the image, send the file to the storage, and then return some data about that file to the frontend. On the frontend, we will g…]]></summary>
