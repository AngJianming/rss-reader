        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A inteligência artificial tem se tornado uma aliada valiosa em diversas áreas dentro das empresas. Um dos fatores que pode determinar a eficácia dessa tecnologia é a qualidade dos prompts utilizados para interagir com ela. Neste artigo, discutiremos a importância de construir prompts bem elaborados e forneceremos dicas práticas para garantir que você obtenha as melhores respostas das LLMs.
A engenharia de prompt surgiu como uma nova habilidade e ela é tão recente que ainda estamos aprendendo como usá-la. Essa habilidade nos permite criar inputs otimizados para os modelos de linguagem da inteligência artificial nos retornarem respostas que sejam relevantes. É importante ressaltar que a qualidade do prompt pode influenciar significativamente a acurácia da resposta recebida.
Considere as seguintes etapas para criar seu prompt:
1. Ações
2. Dê contexto
3. Formatação
4. Exemplificação
5. Persona
6. Entonação
A criação de prompts eficazes é uma habilidade importante que pode maximizar o potencial da IA. Ao focar em clareza, contexto e especificidade, qualquer pessoa, independente da função ou área, pode aprimorar suas interações com a IA e, assim, alcançar melhores resultados. Invista tempo na elaboração de seus prompts e observe como isso pode transformar suas experiências com a tecnologia.]]></summary>

In a May 15 letter to Senator Richard Blumenthal, lawyers for World Liberty Financial claimed a call to investigate the crypto platform was based on “fundamentally flawed premises and inaccuracies.” Witkoff did not specifically address any allegations, claiming that WLFI was “too busy building” for oversight.
“The Company rejects the false choice between innovation and oversight,” said the letter. “What it opposes is the misuses of regulatory authority and uncertainty to suppress lawful innovation.”

Following a May 16 hearing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department announced that Council would serve 14 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. He was part of a group that compromised the X account of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024 and said the regulatory body would be approving spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs.
Prosecutors had requested that the judge impose a two-year sentence, while Council’s lawyers asked for one year and one day. Court filings showed he earned roughly $50,000 through SIM swap attacks like the one that compromised the SEC’s X account — funds likely subject to forfeiture.

While this works for basic setups, advanced deployments often require more sophisticated pod placement strategies. Kubernetes affinity provides precise control over where pods run, enabling organizations to meet specific requirements for compliance, performance optimization, and high availability.
By implementing affinity rules, administrators can ensure workloads run on nodes with appropriate hardware, minimize latency between related services, and distribute applications across failure domains for enhanced reliability. This powerful feature becomes particularly valuable as cluster deployments grow in size and complexity.

In a May 16 announcement, Romero said her last day at the agency would be on May 31, ahead of her initial plans to leave if the Senate confirmed former commissioner Brian Quintenz as the new chair. Her departure will come just one day after Commissioner Summer Mersinger is expected to step down to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO.
“It has been a tremendous honor to conclude my 23 years of federal service at an agency with such an important mission to ensure that financial markets perform their critical role in the US and global economies,” said Romero.
Romero and Mersinger’s upcoming departures would leave the CFTC with only two Senate-confirmed members: acting chair Caroline Pham and Commissioner Kristin Johnson, each taking one Republican and Democratic seat, respectively. The shakeup in leadership gives President Donald Trump the opportunity to pick two more commissioners after the Senate addresses Quintenz’s nomination.

So let's see what toil actually is, when it’s worth automating, and later, a bit of my personal opinion on the topic.
It isn’t just some annoying work—it has distinct characteristics:
Manual: Requires human intervention, even if it’s just running a script.
Repetitive: Happens frequently, consuming time without creating lasting improvements.
Automatable: Could be replaced by a machine or designed away entirely.
Lacks Enduring Value: Doesn’t leave the system in a better state after completion.
Scales Linearly: Work increases linearly bounded to some source metric, making it harder to manage. Example: if the number of users jumps from one thousand to one million, would that increase this particular chore?

Suppose you have a banking website. Would you rather show wrong numbers to your customers or show no data at all? Rather show no data. However, if you're Facebook, you would of course rather show wrong data (not-updated likes count for example) than no data.

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”

While less than 1% of Coinbase’s active monthly users were reportedly affected, the expected remediation and reimbursement expenses range from $180 million to $400 million, as the exchange pledged to repay all phishing attack victims.
Despite the attack on the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, investor sentiment remains optimistic, with the Fear & Greed Index remaining firmly in the “Greed” zone above 69, according to CoinMarketCap data.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, the executive said that Bitwise's Bitcoin price prediction model is driven exclusively by supply and demand metrics. Hougan laid out the specific figures driving the forecast:
"We know that miners will produce 165,000 BTC this year. Already, publicly traded companies have bought more than that. ETFs are at $6 billion in inflows. We think governments are going to be buying. We see this sort of structural difference between demand and supply."

Speaking to Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Carbone argued it is in the best interests of the US to pass comprehensive stablecoin regulations to protect US dollar hegemony in global markets, which has bipartisan appeal and support. Carbone said:
"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote."

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. 
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.
In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…]]></summary>

Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. 
In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.
The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high…]]></summary>

Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement, according to a filing on May 15.
Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the rejection does not reverse the company’s victory in the case. The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.

Alderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”

In a May 16 announcement, AsiaStrategy said it is partnering with Sora Ventures to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Sora previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan’s first corporate Bitcoin treasury.
The stock market took immediate notice of the announcement. Top Win stock closed the trading day at $7.50 on May 15, but traded at $12.12 in premarket at the time of writing — a jump of over 60%.

Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…]]></summary>

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based; Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.
