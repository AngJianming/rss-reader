        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧨 Introduction: The Hero You Never Noticed


It hides in plain sight.

It means nothing… and yet, without it, everything breaks.  
We’re talking about zero (0) — the ninja of numbers, the invisible warrior of math, and quite possibly the most dangerous number in your codebase.
Sounds dramatic?

Good. Because zero is dramatic. Let’s unravel why.
Thousands of years ago, civilizations thrived without the number zero.
The Romans had no symbol for zero.
Try writing 2025 in Roman numerals: MMXXV — not a zero in sight.
Ancient Egyptians also skipped it. Imagine doing math without nothing.
It wasn’t until around 7th century India that Brahmagupta gave us a formal concept of zero — as both a number and a placeholder. That changed everything:
From calculating stars to building Google’s search algorithm — zero laid the foundation.



Feature
Why It's Crazy





0 means nothing
But it’s still something




0 adds no value
But it’s crucial in 10, 100, 1000



0 / x = 0
But x / 0 = Infinity or crash!


0 / 0 = NaN
Wait... what? 😵



0 is falsy in code
But sometimes it’s a valid value



Let’s test your instincts:
console.log(2 / 2);   // 1 ✅
console.log(0 / 2);   // 0 ✅
console.log(2 / 0);   // Infinity 😵
console.log(0 / 0);   // NaN 😱

Wait… 0 / 0 = NaN?
That’s right. Because there’s no single correct answer.
And your program doesn’t like ambiguity.
Let’s list some real-world zero problems:
Divide-by-zero exceptions → 💥 App crash
Falsy values in conditionals → Missed logic paths
Off-by-one errors → Classic loop bugs
Unintended array behavior → array[0] is fine, but array[-1]? 🪦
Zero is sneaky. One minute it's a valid value, the next it's triggering bugs you’ll chase for hours.
Every image, website, or TikTok dance you see on your phone is just a giant sea of 0s and 1s.
Zero isn’t just "nothing."
Zero may look harmless.
Next time your code misbehaves, don’t overlook the quietest suspect.
The real bug might be... 0.]]></summary>

As cities grow and security becomes an ever more significant concern, the demand for smarter, real-time surveillance systems increases. Fence companies, particularly those operating in urban areas like Chicago, are beginning to adopt IoT (Internet of Things) technologies to modernize their offerings. This post explores how to build a real-time notification system using a smart Fence IoT setup.
This guide will walk you through developing an alert system that detects fence breaches or tampering, sending instant notifications to your phone or central monitoring dashboard.
Whether you’re running a fence company or looking to add security enhancements to a residential or commercial property, this solution can elevate your service offering and meet today’s security needs.

Landing Page for Suite (a hypothetical product) (Attempt 1 & 2)


Live Demo: https://edwardcjianken.github.io/suite-landing-page/
https://github.com/edwardcjianken/suite-landing-page


I did two separate attempts for this layout to reinforce how to handle more complex designs. The layout features a 3-column hero section, with certain elements from the first column intentionally overflowing into the second — a style I haven’t tried before.


✨ Things I Learned:
1. Gradient Button with Smooth Transition

Button without mouse hover:

2. Overflowing Image Beyond Container



3. Understanding flex-basis and min-width
