But here’s the thing: email marketing is very much a developer’s playground. If you’re building apps, launching products, or even tinkering with side projects, email is often the most powerful, flexible, and technical tool you have for reaching users.
And to make it easier for folks like us, I put together this repo:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi developers,
I'm working on a web-based invoice application (Angular/HTML/CSS based), and I have an issue during printing:
🖨️ Problem:
The print preview shows the invoice perfectly aligned with correct fonts, layout, and spacing.
But when I actually print it, the alignment is off, some text overflows or gets clipped, and occasionally the ink prints unevenly (bold/faint).
🎯 My Setup:
Printed from Google Chrome (latest)
HTML/CSS-based invoice template
Using @media print CSS rules for styling the print view
✅ What I've Tried:
Adjusted page margins using CSS
Set @page size and margins
Checked printer settings (A4, scaling: 100%, margin: none)
Disabled headers/footers in print dialog
Tested on different printers and browsers
❓ What I want to know:
What are the common causes of mismatch between print preview and printed output?
Are there any best practices for ensuring consistent print layouts in HTML?
Is this a CSS/HTML issue, printer driver issue, or browser-related?
Any help or resources would be appreciated!
Thanks 🙏]]></summary>

Most developers use browsers daily but rarely understand the intricate processes happening behind the scenes. What does the browser actually do when you load a webpage? This article offers a clear breakdown of how browsers process HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — from receiving raw data to rendering pixels on your screen.
The process begins when a user navigates to a URL. The browser sends a request and receives a response in the form of raw bytes — not readable content.
The browser must first convert these bytes into characters using character encoding, typically UTF-8. This decoded character stream is then passed on for further processing.
The character stream is passed to the HTML parser, which breaks it down into tokens. These to…]]></summary>

❌ Error Explained:
Method invocation failed because [System.Object[]] does not contain a method named 'op_Addition'
This means you're trying to add to a value that’s not a point object, probably because .Position is returning an array or something not cast correctly.
✅ Fix — Cast the mouse position correctly before doing math
Update your script like this:
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
Clear-Host
$sleep = 30  # seconds
while ($true) {
# Move slightly and back
[System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position = New-Object System.Drawing.Point($x + 1, $y)
Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 100
[System.Windows.Forms.Cursor]::Position = New-Object System.Drawing.Point($x, $y)

Write-Host "Mouse moved to prevent lock. Waiting $sleep seconds..."
Start-Sleep -Seconds $sleep

}




✅ Why this works:
$pos.X and $pos.Y safely extract coordinates as numbers.
New-Object System.Drawing.Point(...) constructs a valid point object for cursor movement.
Avoids the invalid attempt to do math on an object array.
