Vamos desvendar cada camada técnica 🕵️  
O Lynx introduz um modelo de dual-thread que separa radicalmente a lógica de negócios da renderização. Enquanto o React Native ainda depende da famosa (e às vezes problemática) ponte entre JavaScript e nativo, o Lynx opera com:  
UI Thread (PrimJS): Motor JavaScript otimizado (fork do QuickJS) dedicado exclusivamente a renderização

"You weren't chosen. You never were. But this time, you’re not asking."
The world turned while you stood still.
You tried to be someone. A taxi driver who couldn’t find his way home. A software developer whose code always compiled — but never connected. A dozen roles played, a thousand dreams deferred.
You lived in the margins. A quiet shadow in fluorescent cities, drifting from rejection to rejection like an errant file lost in a corrupted sector.
But something changed. One night, a map appeared in your terminal — glitching into view between job rejections and broken threads. It bore no coordinates, only a phrase: "The Lonely Island Knows."
Now, you are no longer waiting.
Across flooded subway tunnels, through whispering forests of abandoned silicon, and past ghost towns built on failed prototypes, you chase a legend whispered only on 2600 baud frequencies: The Lonely Island — the place where misfits rewrite fate.
This is no hero’s quest. It’s not about saving the world. It’s about finding where it stopped caring about you.
It’s about going off-grid — to write a new code into the system of existence itself.
Prepare for cryptic terminals, sentient algorithms, neon storms, and voices from other timelines who almost made it.
Your failures were your training. Your rejection is your power. And your destination is unknown...
Whereabouts of the Lonely Island™
A solo journey through the memory dumps of fate.
Coming soon to a system that forgot you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloud copilots have officially arrived across the Big Three! 👏 
All three major cloud providers—Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure—now offer AI copilots purpose-built for DevOps and Reliability Engineering. Though branded differently, they all share a common goal: shortening Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) by automatically analyzing observability data, linking it to infrastructure context, and guiding teams through root cause analysis and remediation.
It's hardly surprising that LLM-powered assistants have reached the cloud infrastructure space, given how rapidly they're gaining ground across every layer of modern software development. From code completion to testing, AI copilots are becoming indispensable tools for developers and operations teams alike.
In this competitive landscape, Google led the charge, Amazon followed suit, and Azure has just joined the party:
Status: Well-established market leader

Previously: Duet AI

Learn more: Gemini for Google Cloud
Status: Strong contender in the race

Focus: Developer productivity and operations

Learn more: Amazon Q Developer
Status: Latest addition to the lineup

Specialty: Site Reliability Engineering workflows

Learn more: Azure SRE Agent
While these solutions currently serve as intelligent assistants that support human decision-making, we might be witnessing the early stages of a fundamental shift. In the future, AI copilots could evolve from supporting tools to become the primary interface for incident response and infrastructure management.
This evolution raises fascinating questions:
How will the role of SREs and DevOps engineers evolve?
What new skills will teams need to develop?
How will we balance automation with human oversight?
Have you tried any of these cloud copilots? What's been your experience with AI-assisted operations? 
Drop your thoughts in the comments! 👇
What cloud copilot features do you think we'll see next? Share your predictions!]]></summary>

Unlike traditional kits that come with pre-selected designs, a custom paint by numbers kit allows you to upload a photo—of a loved one, pet, scenic view, or even a cherished memory—and turn it into a paintable canvas. The kit includes everything you need:
A pre-printed numbered canvas based on your image
A full set of corresponding acrylic paints
Multiple brushes of varying thickness
Optional frame or stretching tools for display
It's art made personal, and it's transforming how people engage with painting at home.
By painting a subject that holds meaning for you, such as a wedding photo or a beloved pet, the experience becomes not just artistic, but deeply personal. It adds sentimental value that no store-bought wall art can match.…]]></summary>

Expo has a guide on how to set it up through their proprietary services, which I decided not to use to avoid the feeling of being platform-locked. Personally, the biggest benefit of Expo is keeping the manual implementation and management of native code to a minimum, as the longer a project lives, the harder it becomes to keep track of changes in different files for numerous libraries.

This tutorial was done under the CodeBehind framework owned by Elanat.

Migrating from traditional WebForms to WebForms Core offers several advantages:
Modern Architecture: WebForms Core introduces a revolutionary approach to handling DOM elements directly from the server, eliminating the need for front-end frameworks.
Cross-Language Compatibility: Unlike classic WebForms, WebForms Core supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Elixir, NodeJS, GO, and Rust.
Improved Performance: The new architecture reduces server load, eliminates ViewState bloat, and optimizes data transmission, leading to faster page loads.
Event-Driven Structure: It supports all HTML events and integrates seamlessly with MVC, MVVM, and MVP development patterns.
Efficient Data Handling: Instead of full-page reloads, WebForms Core uses XMLHttpRequest to send small, efficient commands to the client.
Enhanced Control Over HTML: Developers gain greater flexibility in managing UI components without the limitations of traditional WebForms.]]></summary>

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and Nvidia's earnings cap risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, is planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Financial Times reported. The move would position the company to follow the footsteps of crypto treasury companies like Strategy.
In a statement to the FT, the company denied any plans for a Bitcoin treasury. “Apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” it reportedly said. Cointelegraph has reached out for further comment, but has not received a response at the time of publication.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…]]></summary>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…]]></summary>

US President Donald Trump has extended the deadline of a proposed 50% tariff on EU goods to July 9.

A temporary easing in trade tensions could help fuel Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price climbed back above $109,000 during the late trading hours on May 25, as traders responded to President Donald Trump’s decision to delay the implementation of tariffs on EU goods until July 9.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC rose by as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of $110,100 on May 26 from a low of $106,660 on May 25.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s “Bull Case” forecast. In a Feb. 11 video, Wood said the price would require BTC to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, largely fueled by increased institutional adoption.

Over 70% of XRP’s realized cap was accumulated near recent highs, echoing previous market top patterns.

XRP’s active address count has plunged over 90% since March 2025, signaling reduced transactional demand.

A falling wedge pattern points to a potential 25% drop toward key support at the $1.76 level.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

BTC price action dipped below $107,000 before rebounding into the weekly close, as some eagerly anticipate new record highs.

US inflation data meets bond market woes this week as the Federal Reserve shows no signs of cutting interest rates.

On exchanges, the taker buy/sell ratio is causing concern for analysis amid cooling order book activity.

One whale, however, is having fun, and his successive longs and shorts are being increasingly watched in trading circles.

According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, $3.3 billion in tokens will be released in June, a 32% decline in unlocked tokens month-on-month. In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  
Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures.

“It was the worst food I’ve ever had at a Trump golf course,” Nicholas Pinto told WIRED on May 23, while other attendees the outlet interviewed said that the meal was “OK, but not top-class.”
On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.
“The only good thing was bread and butter,” Pinto said, adding he left the venue still hungry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.
Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.
