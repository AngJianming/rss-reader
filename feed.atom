In this article, we’ll take a peek behind the curtain and explore how NativePHP blends Laravel with Electron to deliver powerful, native-feeling desktop apps.
At its core, NativePHP is a Laravel package that allows you to build desktop applications using familiar Laravel syntax. But rather than reinventing the wheel, it cleverly leverages Electron, a popular framework that powers apps like VS Code, Slack, and Figma.
So what NativePHP really does is:
Act as a bridge between Laravel (backend) and Electron (frontend).


Abstract away the complexity of managing Electron from Laravel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we started DoozieSoft in 2013, we were two people with conviction but no capital. We watched startups raise millions for ideas we quietly implemented as client features. While the ecosystem was chasing unicorns, we were chasing customer satisfaction — one deliverable at a time. We never took investor money, never skipped a salary, and never compromised on quality. That decision slowed us down, but it also gave us something rare: control.
Over the years, we built internal tools to improve how we worked — communication assistants, invoice processors, smart form engines. They were never meant to be products, but every time we used them, we realized: we’re sitting on real value. DoozieGPT Labs was born from this realization — a focused effort to turn our internal AI experiments into usable, scalable, India-first solutions.
This isn’t a pivot. It’s a parallel engine. One that draws from over a decade of enterprise delivery, powered by a team that knows how to ship under constraints. Our AI stack blends the best of hosted models (OpenAI, Gemini) with self-hosted LLMs (Ollama), tied together by Laravel, .NET, Python, and pragmatic workflows. We’re not chasing virality — we’re building tools that help real businesses do more with less.
SayBetter helps teams write with empathy. DoozFlow is bringing intelligence to invoice automation. Phoenix is our long-term bet — a full AI-native platform that can serve SMEs without vendor lock-in.
We didn’t miss the boat. We chose to build our own.
And now, through DoozieGPT Labs, we’re ready to bring to the world what we've been quietly building for ourselves — one purposeful tool at a time.]]></summary>

In a time where international shipping is more important than ever, one computer science student is bringing real-world impact through code — by helping customers in Tajikistan track their shipments from China with just a Telegram message.
Meet Ismoil Rahmonov, a student at Hangzhou Dianzi University, who created @cjcargotj_bot, an AI-powered Telegram bot that serves as the digital assistant for CJCARGO Khujand, a cargo delivery company specializing in China–Tajikistan logistics.
Ismoil realized that many families in Tajikistan order goods from China but have little visibility on their shipment status — especially those who aren't tech-savvy.

  ‍Hierarchy on the Floor


In the early 20th century, manufacturing was organized with a rigid hierarchy. Managers and engineers made all significant decisions, while front-line workers were expected to "do as they're told," performing narrow tasks without input into process or strategy. Factory workers, often seen as low-status laborers, had little agency beyond their assigned duties. This division meant that problem-solving and innovation were the sole province of experts and senior staff, not the rank-and-file. By the 1930s, the typical American steel mill or machine shop exemplified this top-down structure. Workers on the shop floor desired better pay and conditions, but companies struggling through the Great Depression h…]]></summary>

Kyle Simpson
Why does JavaScript feel... different?
Every developer has that moment. You're writing code, everything seems logical, and then JavaScript does something that makes you pause and think: "Wait, that actually worked?"
A variable becomes a function.

An object transforms mid-execution.

Async operations flow like water.
Other languages demand you follow their rules. JavaScript asks: "What are you trying to accomplish?" Then it finds a way — often multiple ways — to make it happen.
This isn't accident. It's intentional design philosophy that emerged from a simple truth: the web is chaotic, unpredictable, and constantly changing. So J…]]></summary>

Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.
Examples

b = [121, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11] 
a = [121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11]

b = [132, 14641, 20736, 361, 25921, 361, 20736, 361]
