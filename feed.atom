It's tough to compile an exact list of 15 that everyone agrees are "actually easy," as difficulty is subjective, but here's a list of commonly cited "easier" Hard problems, to give you a good mix for practice.
Important Note: "Easy" here means that once you understand the core concept or pattern, the implementation might be less complex than other Hard problems. These still require solid problem-solving skills!

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser — on the server-side.
Node.js lets you use JavaScript to build server-side applications, command-line tools, and backend services.
It’s built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, which makes it fast, efficient, and lightweight.

If you've ever opened Duolingo for 100+ days straight but still froze during a real conversation, you're not alone. Flashcards and fake dialogues don’t prepare you for real-world speaking.
YAP flips the model.
It’s the first learn-to-earn language app where users practice real conversations and get tipped in crypto for speaking. We reward fluency, not memorization. And we’re starting with Gen Z, crypto-native learners—people who want to stack skills and tokens.
We’re a small team of two (a non-technical -- me, and a technical co-founder). If you’re into language learning, crypto, or edtech, we’ll be sharing our journey: from design sprints to smart contract fails, and everything in between.
Follow along. Or better—build with us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎀 The Problem


Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
Example:


Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
,,,,_]
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {

        int index = 0;
        int current = nums[0];
        boolean check = false;


        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int next = nums[i];

            if (check == false && current == next) {
                index++;
                check = true;
            } else if (check == true && current < next) {
                nums[index] = next;
                current = next;
                index++;
            } else if (check == false && current < next) {
                index++;
                current = next;
            }
        }

        if (check == false)
            index++;

        return index;
    }
}


🔺 Runtime & Memory
✖️ Too long
I redid this problem using the "Two Pointer" approach on my own.
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {

        int index = 0;
        int current = 1;

        while (current < nums.length) {
            if (nums[current] != nums[index]) {
                nums[index+1] = nums[current];
                index++;
            }
            current++;
        }

        return index+1;
    }
}


I have improved the runtime, but how can I improve memory?
I think I mastered the "Two Pointers" method.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common types of noise in digital images is impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise. This type of noise randomly alters certain pixels in the image by setting them to the minimum or maximum possible intensity values (e.g., 0 and 255 in 8-bit images), while the rest of the pixels remain unchanged.
Applying a Gaussian filter in these cases is counterproductive. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel smooths the image through a weighted averaging operation, which affects both noisy and non-noisy pixels. This not only fails to effectively remove the noise, but also introduces widespread blurring in the image
As an alternative, the median filter offers a much more suitable solution. This filter replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the intensity values of its neighbors within a local window (typically square-shaped). By focusing on the central value of the sorted data, the median filter preserves edges and is highly effective at removing outliers such as those introduced by salt-and-pepper noise.
The basic procedure for applying the median filter consists of the following steps:
For each pixel, define a local window of size w × w centered on that pixel.
2.Extract all intensity values within that window.
3.Sort the values.
4.Replace the central pixel value with the median of the sorted list.

Seamless Cross-Platform Design Innovation

If you're not familiar with the term, think of threat modeling as the process of asking, “What can go wrong?” before your AI app is exposed to the real world. For AI systems, this means looking beyond traditional vulnerabilities and into the unique risks that come with using models, training data, and user prompts.
Threat modeling isn’t new. It’s been a common part of security practices for years. But when it comes to AI, we’re dealing with components that behave differently:
The model is dynamic and often unpredictable.
The data is unstructured and possibly user-generated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, a CLI tool for visualizing Claude Code usage costs has been making waves in Japan. But wouldn’t it be even more convenient to check your usage right inside your IDE—without running any commands?
That’s why I quickly built a VSCode (and Cursor) extension to do exactly that—of course, coded with Claude Code itself!
Source code and install instructions are here:
https://github.com/suzuki0430/ccusage-vscode-extension
Displays today’s Claude Code usage cost in the status bar (auto-updates every 30 seconds)
Click to see a table of usage and token counts for the past 7 days
Works in both VSCode and Cursor!
Here’s how it looks in action:

Click to open details:

git clone https://github.com/suzuki0430/ccusage-vscode-extension.git
cd ccusage-vscode-extension

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Package the extension
npm run package

This will create a file called ccusage-vscode-0.1.0.vsix in your current directory.
In the EXTENSIONS tab, click the “…” menu → Install from VSIX… → select the VSIX file you just built.

After importing, the cost will appear in the status bar. (If it doesn’t, try restarting VSCode.)

Simply drag and drop the VSIX file into the EXTENSIONS sidebar.

Whether you’re worried about overusing the Claude API or just want to check if your MAX plan is worth it, this extension makes it super easy to keep an eye on your costs.

Verb is built directly on Bun's native HTTP server with zero external dependencies. This means you get the raw performance of Bun without any abstraction overhead. Here's the simplest example:
import { createServer, json, text } from "verb";

const app = createServer({ port: 3000 });

app.get("/", () => text("Hello, Verb!"));
app.get("/api/users/:id", (req, params) => json({ id: params.id }));

That's a working server. No configuration files, no boilerplate.
Verb uses an LRU cache for compiled route patterns. After the first request to a route, subsequent matches are nearly instant:
