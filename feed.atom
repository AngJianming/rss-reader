        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a small purple dragon leapt joyfully onto television screens in 1998, gaming felt simpler. Spyro's tale was charmingly clear-cut: dragons good, Gnorcs bad. Yet, as those early fans grew alongside the medium itself, uncomplicated childhood memories gave way to reflective curiosity. With maturity comes the realisation that even playful narratives can unwittingly reveal complex truths—sometimes challenging, always intriguing.
Among Spyro's cast, no group invites this reconsideration quite like the Gnorcs. Originally depicted as brutish, green-skinned adversaries to vanquish without second thought, today they stir conversation far beyond simple nostalgia.
Central to this renewed interrogation of Spyro's world is Gnasty Gnorc himself. Once an outright villain, his motivations now appear le…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most teams spend hours documenting everything.
Notion workspaces. Confluence pages. GitHub wikis. You name it.
But here’s what happens:
☑️New hires still get stuck.  ☑️Devs still ask questions that are, “Somewhere in the docs” and crucial context gets lost.
This is the Documentation Paradox: The more you write, the harder it gets to find, trust, and maintain what actually matters.
Conventional wisdom says, “Async teams need tons of docs!”
But I’ll say: More docs often mean less clarity.
Here’s why:
First, there's the maintenance burden.
Every line of documentation is a liability that needs updating as your codebase evolves.
How many teams actually do that?
Second, comprehensive documentation creates a false sense of security.
Teams believe they're covered because it's in the docs somewhere.
What you should do is treat documentation as a conversation, not an artifact.
Use tools that make updating docs as easy as sending a message.
Encourage annotations and questions directly in the documentation.
And remember the 20/80 rule: 20% of your features generate 80% of questions. Focus your efforts there.
The goal isn't to have everything documented – it's to have the right documentation that actually helps your team move faster.
This is why every Rally session lives forever inside Jira
No more sorting through old Slack threads.
Every discussion stays tied to the task, so your team’s knowledge grows with the work—not in a dusty folder.]]></summary>

In this article, we'll explore how to convert strings while following the two scenarios provided in your request: changing capitalization and formatting string cases to appear more human-friendly.
Understanding the Humanization Process
When we discuss 'humanizing' a string, we're typically referring to text transformation that makes it easier for humans to read or understand. This can involve adjusting capitalization, changing the case, or formatting text to look more polished and readable. Unlike Ruby, where the humanize function applies well-defined transformations, C# requires us to craft our own methods.

When working with Rust and Diesel, you may encounter various issues, especially when performing count queries. In this article, we'll examine a specific error that arises from executing a count query using Diesel with PostgreSQL. The error message states, 'the trait bound i32: FromSql<BigInt, Pg> is not satisfied'. This indicates a type mismatch in your query resolution.
Understanding the Error
The error is primarily triggered because the Diesel ORM expects a specific data type from the SQL count result. Typically, when using the count function in a SQL query, the result is of type BigInt in PostgreSQL, which corresponds to i64 in Rust. However, your code attempts to return the result as an i32, leading to the compile error.

That’s a huge shift from rivals like Apple (15%+) and even Steam’s tiered 30/25/20% model, so smaller titles can keep every penny until they hit that million-dollar mark.
On top of that, Epic’s rolling out “Webshops” hosted right in the store—letting devs send players to make purchases outside the app and dodge Apple/Google’s hefty fees. Players even earn a 5% Epic Rewards bonus on webshop buys. All this follows a landmark US ruling forcing Apple to allow alternate payment options, and it comes as the Epic Store’s user base swells (295 million PC players last year, up 25 million).]]></summary>

According to a May 6 Financial Times report, the crypto traders earned roughly $100 million from buying $2.6 million worth of MELANIA tokens before the public launch on Jan. 19.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.

The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

Paws is a Telegram-based Mini App created by the same team behind other projects, such as Notcoin and Dogs. 
If you’ve been cruising around Telegram lately, chances are you’ve stumbled upon Paws, the viral crypto Mini App that’s got everyone tapping, clicking and inviting their friends like it’s 2010 FarmVille all over again. 
Originally launched in October 2024 on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, Paws exploded in popularity with its ultra-simple tap-to-earn concept. Think of it as a gamified rewards engine embedded directly in Telegram, where users rack up points by completing tasks, referring others and interacting with mini-game elements.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

Turner, who has spent over 20 years at the IRS and most recently served as a senior adviser within the Digital Assets Office, will now head the unit, according to a report from Bloomberg Tax citing a person familiar with the situation.
Her promotion marks a significant leadership transition at a time when US crypto tax enforcement is facing both internal and external pressures.

“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.
