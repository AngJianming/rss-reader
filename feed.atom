Hi there,
What's XS?
XS (eXternal Subroutine) is a glue language that helps Perl interact with C.
Sounds simple?
In my personal experience, it's not simple at all. I've tried many times but never managed to fully grasp it. Recently, Robert Acock, shared a blog post series titled Learning XS, which I found very helpful in unraveling its complexity.
Robert Acock also wrote another blog series for newcomers: Learning Perl. I'm sure this would be handy for anyone looking to explore Perl.
Lately, I've been playing with AWS S3 and have shared my experiences in two posts so far:
LocalStack with AWS S3
AWS S3 Encryption
There are plenty more articles in the pipeline, so watch this space!
Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.

ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) defines a communication specification between asynchronous web servers and application frameworks, consisting of three core components:

Receive Channel: Asynchronously receives request bodies and messages.


Send Channel: Asynchronously sends response headers, response bodies, and close signals.

The CYPRESS-SCHEMA-VALIDATOR is fully backward-compatible with the previous version, and continues to integrate smoothly with leading Cypress API plugins like @bahmutov/cy-api and cypress-plugin-api.
This new version represents a significant leap forward in flexibility, usability, and debugging efficiency.

Fluent Interface: REST-assured uses a behavior-driven development (BDD) style syntax that makes tests readable and maintainable:

Then came the date formatting. Then the ID generator. Then a function to normalize order items—but just the formatting, we said.
Six months later, helpers.ts was 800 lines, had three different behaviors behind getFormattedAmount, and included a “temporary” fix for tax rules in Germany.

API testing is fundamental in modern software development, especially in microservices architectures and distributed applications. A robust API testing framework allows us to validate functionality, performance, and security of our endpoints before reaching production.
In this article, we'll explore how to implement a complete API testing framework using Postman and Newman, automating it with GitHub Actions and creating a practical demonstration project.
Newman is the command-line version of Postman, perfect for CI/CD integration:
npm install -g newman
npm install -g newman-reporter-html
