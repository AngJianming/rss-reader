And no, it’s not a bug. It’s a feature… well, sort of.
In this post, let’s break down what these hallucinations are, why they happen, and how folks are trying to fix them — without going full research paper on you.
In humans, hallucinations mean seeing or hearing stuff that’s not there.
For large language models (LLMs), it means making stuff up — facts, links, names, quotes, whatever. Sometimes it’s subtle (like getting a date wrong), other times it’s full-blown fiction (inventing research papers or claiming a celebrity starred in a movie they didn’t).
And the worst part? The AI says it like it totally knows what it’s t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web Cache Deception is a vulnerability first described in 2017. It occurs when a caching system — such as a reverse proxy or CDN — can be tricked into caching sensitive, dynamic content that should only be delivered to authenticated users but ends up being publicly available. This is usually due to poorly thought-out or inconsistent configurations in how the cache interprets and stores different types of requests.
Many caching systems have simple rules for deciding what can and cannot be cached. A common pattern is to only cache "static" files — such as those ending in .js, .css, .png, .ico, etc. The problem arises when the cache relies solely on the structure of the URL path to make this decision, ignoring the actual behavior of the server behind it.
Imagine this: the caching system is in…]]></summary>

That’s where React Portals come in.
React Portals let you render components outside the normal DOM hierarchy, making it easier to handle z-index, positioning, and layering—without complicating your component logic.
In this guide, you’ll learn what React Portals are, why they matter, and how to use them to build cleaner, more flexible UIs.
React Portals let you render a component outside its parent DOM node—perfect for things like modals or tooltips that need to break out of the usual layout, while still staying in the same React tree.

In C#, anonymous types are useful for encapsulating a set of read-only properties into a single object without explicitly defining a class. However, developers often seek better ways to declare these types without relying on creating instances, which can lead to less readable and maintainable code. This article explores various methods and optimizes the solution for anonymous types in C# while avoiding hacky implementations.
Understanding Anonymous Types in C#
Anonymous types in C# allow you to create simple objects without creating a separate class definition. However, creating instances as seen in your initial example can appear convoluted and detracts from clarity and maintainability.

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reducing Docker image sizes isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential when you're deploying at scale. Bloated images lead to slower CI/CD pipelines, larger attack surfaces, and higher cloud bills. But what if you could cut a 1GB image down to just 30MB? 🚀
By combining Multi-Stage Builds with slim or distroless base images, you can drastically reduce image size without sacrificing functionality or speed.

Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. This lets you separate the build environment (which might be heavy with tools and dependencies) from the runtime environment (which should be as slim as possible).
Build Stage:


Start with a full-featured image like golang, node, or even ubuntu.
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

Production Stage:


Use a lightweight or distroless base image like alpine or Google's gcr.io/distroless/base.
FROM alpine:latest

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .

CMD ["./myapp"]

📉 Result:
15MB!
Smaller size → Faster deployments and fewer storage costs.
Lower attack surface → Minimal OS footprint means fewer vulnerabilities.
Better performance → Streamlined startup and resource consumption.
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /
CMD ["/myapp"]

Final size? As low as 1.8MB! 🧊



Approach
Image Size




Traditional Docker
~400MB


Multi-Stage + Alpine
~15MB


Distroless
~1.8MB



Yes, that's an 800%+ reduction. It's like going from a cargo ship to a jet ski. 🚤
Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files.
Avoid installing dev tools in production layers.
Clean up temporary files and cache during build steps.
Target statically linked binaries when possible.
Optimizing Docker images is one of the easiest wins in your DevOps toolkit.
multi-stage builds and minimal base images, you can keep things lean, secure, and lightning-fast.

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A man from the US state of Virginia will spend over three decades behind bars after being convicted of sending crypto to the terrorist organization commonly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.
Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.
The Justice Department said Chhipa raised funds for the United Nations-designated terror organization through social media, receiving money online or traveling hundreds of miles to a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rumble’s pro-crypto founder and CEO has confirmed that the firm will launch its Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet in the third quarter of this year, aimed at giving the Coinbase Wallet a run for its money. 
The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple has made a slew of acquisitions to control key transaction rails and route them through XRP and its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), drawing comparisons to Japanese investment firm SoftBank. 
The $1.25-billion acquisition of Hidden Road on April 8 allows Ripple to use RLUSD as collateral in the firm’s prime brokerage products. Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.
Omni Network co-founder Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.
Instead of in-house development like Google or Meta (formerly Facebook), SoftBank built its em…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission has blasted her agency over its settlement letter that could finally end the Ripple legal saga. 
The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Coinbase’s total revenue fell 10% quarter-over-quarter to $2 billion in Q1, missing industry estimates by 4.1% as trading activity slowed across the market.
Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.
