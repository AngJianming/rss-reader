But when I started learning it, I felt like I was drowning in useState, useEffect, props, and errors I couldn’t even pronounce.
React almost made me quit frontend.
In this post, I’ll share the five biggest mistakes I made learning React and what you can do to avoid them.
Whether you’re a junior dev, bootcamp grad, or someone who just copy-pastes from Stack Overflow (guilty 😅), this is for you.
useState like a catch-all toolbox



“Need to update something? Just useState it!”
React beginners often abuse useState for everything, from tracking form inputs to managing entire UI states.
This leads to:

Webhooks are the backbone of modern event-driven systems. They allow external services (like Stripe, GitHub, Slack, etc.) to notify your app when something happens — without you having to constantly poll for updates.
Some common use cases:
Handle payments via Stripe
Automate CI/CD pipelines from GitHub pushes
Notify your system about user actions across platforms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're working on a Spring Boot project with Maven, you’ve probably seen both spring-boot-maven-plugin and maven-compiler-plugin in the pom.xml. They sound similar, but they serve completely different purposes.
Let’s break down the difference and when to use each. 👇
🔧 spring-boot-maven-plugin
✅ What it does:
Allows mvn spring-boot:run for quick local development
Bundles all dependencies into a single runnable JAR
🚫 What it doesn’t do:
It does not control the Java compiler version
It does not support annotation processors like Lombok
🧰 maven-compiler-plugin
✅ What it does:
Sets source and target Java versions (e.g., Java 17)
Adds support for annotation processors like lombok
Essential for compiling clean, version-compatible code
🚫 What it doesn’t do:
It does not package your Spring Boot app
It does not include runtime dependencies or embedded servers
🧠 TL;DR — Use Them Together
Both are essential — just for different parts of the build lifecycle.
✍️ Sample Setup
xml
<build>
  <plugins>

    <!-- Compiler plugin for Java version & Lombok support -->
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.11.0</version>
      <configuration>
        <source>17</source>
        <target>17</target>
        <annotationProcessorPaths>
          <path>
            <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
            <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
            <version>1.18.30</version>
          </path>
        </annotationProcessorPaths>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>

    <!-- Spring Boot plugin for building the app -->
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    </plugin>

  </plugins>
</build>

🎯 Tip: If you're seeing unexpected behavior in your Spring Boot build or annotation processing isn't working (like with Lombok), double-check that you're not misusing these plugins.
Hope this clears up the confusion! 🚀]]></summary>

PHP does not support multiple inheritance. To work around this limitation, Traits were introduced in PHP 5.4. They allow injecting methods into several classes without using class inheritance.
When misused, they can harm readability and maintainability. When mastered, they are a great tool to structure shared code. Here's an overview of use cases, best practices, and common pitfalls.
In PHP, a class can only inherit from one parent class. Traits allow factoring reusable behavior into multiple different classes.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It allows developers, analysts, and data engineers to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data with simple yet powerful commands.
Whether you’re building a small web app or handling massive data pipelines, SQL is everywhere.
Data retrieval: SELECT data from tables with filters, joins, and conditions.
Database management: Create, alter, or delete tables and relationships.
Reporting & analytics: Aggregate data using GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY.
Data cleaning: Identify duplicates, fix formats, and ensure consistency.
Integrations: Backend systems, dashboards, and machine learning pipelines all rely on structured data—SQL is the bridge.
It's beginner-friendly, yet highly powerful.
Works across almost all database systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, etc.).
In-demand in tech jobs—from web developers to data scientists.
Whether you're a front-end dev querying a users table or a data analyst building insights—SQL is an essential tool in your stack.
🧠 Tip: Start with basic queries, then dive into subqueries, joins, and window functions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.
In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. 
“Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said.

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blackstone, which bills itself as the “the world’s largest alternative asset manager,” disclosed its first-ever crypto-related purchase, buying shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.
However, Blackstone’s investment, reported in a May 20 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only totaled around $1.08 million — a fraction of the asset manager’s $1.2 trillion portfolio.
Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) as of March 31.
The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, Google Finance data shows.
The filing shows Blackstone also bought 4,300 shares in crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) for a total cost of $6,300 and sp…]]></summary>

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam.
“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”

“This is not about chasing memes or trends,” Adams told the inaugural New York City Crypto Summit on May 20. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today.”
“We have experts right here, and they are going to help us navigate solutions that serve our city,” he added. “The age of tokenization, which includes crypto and blockchain and other fintech innovations, that age is here, and we’re going to continue to move forward with it.”
Adams didn’t share further details on the advisory group, but said a council chair and key policy recommendations would follow in the next few weeks.

Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin (BTC) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution.

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ether (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bancor, the creator of a smart contract-based automated market maker, is suing Uniswap for patent infringement, alleging the decentralized finance exchange has used its technology without permission and profited significantly from it.
According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. 
Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion by: Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal
Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.
The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.
In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises "thin" protocols and "fat" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower ret…]]></summary>

On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.
