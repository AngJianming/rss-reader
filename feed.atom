Next.js middleware lets you run code before a request finishes and update the response. Alongside Edge Functions, it's a powerful tool that enables developers to achieve enhanced functionality and performance. Middleware was introduced in Next.js v12 and has been improved in consecutive versions. Starting with Next.js v13, middleware can be used to respond directly to requests without going through the route handler. 
This can improve performance and security. Middleware can also be used to work with Vercel Edge Functions. Edge Functions allow you to run code at the network's edge. So, in this post, we’ll learn how middleware works with Edge Functions and why it’s important to know. Now, let’s get started!

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …]]></summary>

My name is El Bachir (Elox), and I’m based in Senegal. I’m currently leading Santel Healthcare, an early-stage project aiming to transform healthcare access across Africa through digital innovation, community-led savings, and systemic reform.
We believe that tech can be a bridge — not just a tool — in addressing deep-rooted challenges in health systems. Santel is designed to be more than an app: it’s a movement combining technology, policy advocacy, and inclusive models of care.
🚀 What we’re building:
A first digital prototype (web/mobile) that helps:
We’re currently a small team:

👩‍💻 Who we’re looking for:
A volunteer developer (frontend or fullstack) who:
💡 We’re also open to evolving the role into a long-term collaboration — potentially even a cofounder position — if there’s shared vision and alignment.
⸻

🧭 Why this matters:
In many African countries, people are one illness away from financial catastrophe. Health access is unequal, data is fragmented, and community potential is underused. We believe we can build something simple but powerful to help shift that — together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is one of the most popular and powerful programming languages used to create interactive websites and web applications. 
Types of JavaScript

Variables

Functions

Concatenation

Return statements

Calling Functions

🧩 1. Types in JavaScript
JavaScript supports several data types, which can be grouped into two categories:
These are the basic types:
String: Text. Example: "Hello"

Number: Numeric values. Example: 42, 3.14

Boolean: true or false

Null: A deliberate non-value

Undefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned

Symbol: Unique values (advanced)

BigInt: Large integers (new in ES2020)

let name = "Sivasankari";      // String
🔸 Non-Primitive Types
Object

Array

Function

let person = { name: "Sivasankari", age: 23 };  // Object
🧪 2. Variables in JavaScript
Variables store data values. In modern JavaScript, we use:
let: Block-scoped variable (preferred)

const: Block-scoped, constant value

var: Function-scoped (older and less recommended)

let city = "Coimbatore";
🔧 3. Functions in JavaScript
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a task. Here's how to declare and use them:
function greet() {
greet(); // Call the function
Parameters and Arguments
function greetUser(name) {
greetUser("Alice");  // Output: Hello, Alice!
🔗 4. Concatenation in JavaScript
Concatenation means combining strings.
let firstName = "Siva";
🎁 5. Return Statement
The return keyword gives back a result from a function.
function add(a, b) {
let sum = add(10, 5);  // sum is 15
If you don't use return, the function will return undefined by default.
📞 6. Calling Functions
Once a function is defined, you can call or invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses ().
function sayHello() {
sayHello();  // Output: Hello!
🏁 Conclusion
JavaScript is a powerful language, but understanding these fundamentals — types, variables, functions, return statements, concatenation, and function calls — is a solid first step.]]></summary>

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin (BTC) or when the purchases were made in the announcement, while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.
The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release.
The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years.

In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:
“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”

Bitcoin (BTC) may see support only at $94,000 if a fresh BTC price correction ensues, new analysis says.

Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.
The vote is part of a broader recovery plan that includes using Cetus’s treasury and securing an emergency loan from the Sui Foundation.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

“On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said.
The planned payout, subject to IMF executive board approval, is part of a larger $1.4 billion, 40-month loan deal struck in December, which saw El Salvador agree to confine its Bitcoin ambiti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outgoing US Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero says the exodus of the agency’s top brass is “not a great situation” for crypto regulations.
The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. 
“I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said.
“I’ve always wanted to hear from my fellow commissioners about what makes sense to them, and there are many things that they’ve convinced me of…]]></summary>

In paperwork released by the US Office of Government Ethics on May 25, Brian Quintenz disclosed his key positions in crypto and market firms that would directly relate to the CFTC’s regulatory priorities and disclosed assets worth at least $3.4 million, according to a May 27 Bloomberg report. 
Quintenz was a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and is currently the global head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz, a position he said he will step down from if the Senate confirms him as CFTC chair.

“Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin who chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27.

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.
Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.
