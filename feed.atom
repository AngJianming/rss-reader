        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Glaze! is an interactive media framework in Divooka that features a Processing-like interface.
Today, I'm laying the groundwork for audio APIs for our Glaze! framework.
Divooka Glaze! draws inspiration from SFML and Processing, so we need to understand how those two handle audio first.
To play audio in SFML.Net, we use the SFML.Audio module, which provides two main classes:
Sound + SoundBuffer for short, fully-loaded sounds (like sound effects).
Music for long, streamed audio (like background music).
Short audio files (WAV, OGG, FLAC, etc.) can be fully loaded into memory:
// Load the entire file into a buffer (only do this once per sound).
SoundBuffer buffer = new SoundBuffer("hit.wav");

// Create a Sound instance and assign the buffer.
Sound hitSound = new Sound(buffer);

So the question is: what should new grads learn?
The answer is not as simple, but it is a very interesting one. One thing most students and new grads have to understand is that AI and LLMs are here to stay, and we have to accept and embrace these changes rather than running away or pushing back against them. The inclusion of AI in software engineering makes it easy for developers to build, test, deploy, maintain and document applications. This allows a single software engineer to be more productive.
Some years ago, software engineers were divided into backend, frontend, DevOps, etc. But a…]]></summary>

Have you ever run npx prisma db push and watched it... do nothing? It just freezes, leaving you wondering if your database is giving you the silent treatment. If you've been working with Prisma and Supabase, you've likely encountered this exact scenario.
I recently ran into this issue while trying to push a my prisma schema:
# Regenerate client
npx prisma generate

# Attempting to push the schema
npx prisma db push --force-reset

The commands just hung, never completing successfully. A simple task becoming a frustrating blocker.
After some digging, I realized:
DIRECT_URL: This is your direct, unpooled connection to the Supabase database. This is what Prisma needs for database migrations and schema pushes.

I've been working on DevOps Daily.
It's a free site with DevOps guides, tools, quizzes, and labs.
Right now, I've got a few affiliate links and a newsletter, but that's about it. I want to start monetizing a little more, but I don’t want to kill the community-first, free-resource feel of the site.
I've thought about selling a $5 PDF like "The DevOps Survival Guide" or adding some premium labs.
Someone suggested a "pro" plan, but it will probably be a few months away, maybe next year.
Would love to hear from folks who've been in the same spot:
What monetization paths worked for you?
What didn't work?
How do you keep things useful + authentic while still earning a bit?
Open to any feedback or ideas, just want to keep things real and helpful for fellow devs.]]></summary>
