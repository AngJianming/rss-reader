        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine you're building a React web application. You want to let users sign up or log in, store their data securely, and finally host your app online. You might think you need to:
Set up a database (and pay for it)
Create a custom authentication system
Add features like Google, Facebook, or Microsoft login
Write backend code for all of this
Find a separate service to host the backend
Purchase a domain and find reliable hosting
That‚Äôs a lot of work! üòÖ But what if I told you there‚Äôs a complete solution ‚Äî and it's from Google
Yes, I‚Äôm talking about Firebase üî•
Go to the Firebase Console.
Click ‚ÄúAdd Project‚Äù and follow the steps.
Enable Google Analytics (optional but recommended).




  
  
  2. Add a Web App to Your Project



Once the project is created, choose the web app option.

But while the theory is everywhere, applying these principles in real projects ‚Äî or explaining them to a teammate ‚Äî can be a bit trickier.
This article isn‚Äôt about complex real-world cases. The goal is to show simple, focused examples that clearly illustrate when a principle is being followed and when it‚Äôs not. Use it as a reference for yourself or share it with your team if you want everyone to speak the same language when it comes to writing solid code.
SOLID is an acronym that brings together five design principles for object-oriented programming. They‚Äôre not specific to TypeScript, but they apply well to it ‚Äî and to many modern programming languages.

We dive into Bluesky‚Äôs new features such as trending topics, a three-minute video feed, and Bluesky+ subscriptions while examining parallels with open source funding and blockchain interoperability. In doing so, we also look into community engagement efforts like enhanced verification, anti-toxicity tools, and custom feeds that foster a safe and dynamic environment. Finally, we outline practical applications, technical challenges, and the future outlook for decentralized platforms and open source funding mechanisms.

In this blog, we‚Äôll walk through a practical example that demonstrates how Kubernetes can persist data effectively, even in failure scenarios.
The Problem: Where Did My Data Go?


Containers are lightweight, flexible, and easily restartable, but they come with a challenge: they are stateless by default. This means that every time a container crashes or is redeployed, any data stored inside it vanishes.

Reproducibility: CI/CD pipelines run identical builds


Resource Efficiency: Lightweight compared to full VMs

Then use command

to scan devices new (if you don't see your headphones on list this command is useful), if you see your headphones on list then you can use next command to show you devices.

Why Dependency Management in Monorepos is Like Herding Cats üê±


Monorepos are convenient but come with unique challenges:  
Version conflicts: Project A needs React 18, Project B is stuck on 17.


Dependency drift: Subtle differences in package.json files across projects.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016‚Äì2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.¬†

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto‚Äôs correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum‚Äôs layer-1 scaling ‚Äúmore friendly‚Äù to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship.¬†
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.¬†

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create ‚Äúbits,‚Äù representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song‚Äôs approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and ‚Äúshifts complexity rather than eliminating it.‚Äù

Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption.¬†

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.
