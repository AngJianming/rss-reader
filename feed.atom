Let’s talk about the latest ripple making waves across the tech pond. You probably caught the buzz last week when Shopify’s CEO, Tobi Lütke, dropped an internal memo that basically set a new baseline: using AI isn’t just encouraged anymore, it’s practically expected. The memo even suggested teams need to justify not using AI before asking for more resources or headcount. Forbes quickly jumped on this, slapping a catchy (and maybe slightly terrifying?) “Hire AI, Not Humans” headline on it.
Now, before we dive deep, let’s be clear: this isn’t another think piece about the grand future of AGI, whether LLMs will pass the Turing test nex…]]></summary>

Many developers use export default because it seems obvious, but it has drawbacks:
The function name is fixed and hard to rename during import.
In large codebases, this can lead to errors.
Advantage of export const:
Each component has a clear, unique name, which makes it easier to find and debug.
export default:





export default function getData() {
  return fetch('/api/data');
}


Problem:
You must use the exact name when importing:
import getData from './getData'; // Cannot rename without extra work


export const:





export const getData = () => fetch('/api/data');


Advantage:
You can import it by name and even rename it if needed:
import { getData } from './getData';

Compared to other popular blockchain networks, we could say that Hooks are like smart contracts in EVM-based networks, but with a completely different philosophy and approach, tailored to Xahau’s technology.

If you've recently created a repository on GitHub, initialized it locally using Git, added files, and committed them, yet can’t see your files on GitHub, don’t worry! This guide will help you troubleshoot the problem effectively.
Understanding the Issue
The first step in resolving the issue of missing files in your GitHub repository is understanding how Git works. When you initialize a Git repository on your local machine using $ git init, you create a new Git directory, but none of your files will be tracked unless you add them to the staging area.

React and Next.js 14+ introduced Server Components (RSC) and Client Components to optimize rendering and performance. This architecture allows developers to choose where components execute—on the server or in the browser—resulting in smaller bundles, faster loads, and cleaner architecture.
React separates logic into two environments:
Client (Browser) — For interactivity, state, and DOM effects


Server (Node.js) — For data fetching, caching, and secure logic
Use "use client" and "use server" directives to explicitly control this boundary.
Data Fetching on the server

1. Floating-Point Support in FPGAs
FPGAs do not natively execute floating-point operations like CPUs/GPUs. Instead, they implement them in three ways:
A. Soft Floating-Point (Software Emulation)
Pros:
Works on any FPGA.
Flexible (supports single/double precision).
Cons:
Slow (high latency, ~10-100x slower than fixed-point).
Consumes lots of logic resources.
B. Hard Floating-Point (Dedicated DSP Blocks)
Stratix 10, Xilinx UltraScale+) have hardened DSP blocks with floating-point support.
Pros:
Much faster than soft FP.
Lower power than emulated FP.
Cons:
Only available in high-end FPGAs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decentralized settlement protocol Kima has integrated into Mastercard’s sandbox program, enabling stablecoin-powered top-ups for prepaid cards directly from self-custody wallets.
According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Mastercard partners can now rely on Kima’s settlement infrastructure to enable their prepaid cards to be topped up with stablecoins, including USDC (USDC) and Tether’s USDt (USDT), from self-custody wallets across more than 10 blockchains. 
Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use, removing friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability.
“Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said.

World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.
Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.
This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, Ge…]]></summary>

The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Colorado-incorporated firm has been linked to a Chinese illicit marketplace that has served scammers in Southeast Asia and has been used to channel billions of dollars worth of crypto.
The marketplace, called Xinbi Guarantee, has received $8.4 billion, primarily in Tether (USDT) stablecoin transactions to date, blockchain security firm Elliptic reported on May 13. 
Merchants on the Chinese-language, Telegram-based marketplace sell technology, personal data, and money laundering services to Southeast Asian scammers who target victims using pig butchering scams. 
On its website, Xinbi describes itself as an “investment and capital guarantee group company” and claims to operate through Xinbi Co. Ltd, a Colorado-incorporated company incorporated in 2022.

A brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, was foiled after the daughter and passersby reportedly fought off the kidnappers.
Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.
The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by "risk-on" sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …]]></summary>

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
