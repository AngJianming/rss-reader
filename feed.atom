        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of modern backend development, clear and interactive API documentation isn't just a nice-to-have-it's essential. That's where Swagger comes in, and specifically, the @𝘈𝘱𝘪𝘖𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 annotation stands out as a game changer for Spring Boot and Java developers.
The @𝘈𝘱𝘪𝘖𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 annotation allows you to describe individual operations (HTTP methods on specific paths) within your API, making your documentation more precise and developer-friendly. By adding concise summaries, detailed notes, and expected response types, you help consumers understand your endpoints at a glance. This clarity not only accelerates onboarding for new team members but also reduces miscommunication and support overhead.
Here’s why you should care:
𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: Summarize what each endpoint does, making it easier for others to consume your API.
𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Well-documented APIs foster better teamwork, especially in microservices environments.
𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Swagger UI leverages these annotations to provide a live, testable interface for your APIs, boosting productivity for everyone involved.
𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆: Using @𝘈𝘱𝘪𝘖𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 ensures your documentation stays consistent and up-to-date as your API evolves.
How are you using Swagger and @𝘈𝘱𝘪𝘖𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 in your projects? What best practices or challenges have you encountered? Let’s spark a discussion-share your experiences or questions below!

Mainly that it’s bloated and plugin-heavy. Some people immediately started firing at me, telling me SEO would be "whack" if I used anything else... as if SEO was a feature toggle in WordPress.
But let’s be clear about something:

Google doesn’t rank your site based on your CMS!

Google doesn’t care if you’re using WordPress, Webflow, Drupal or your content is served from a Google Sheet.
Google doesn’t have a CMS bias built in. It doesn’t know how "clean" your CMS feels or cares about how many Yoast plugins you’ve installed. It only sees data. Numbers. Metrics. That's it.

Unfortunately, not every junior developer makes it to the senior level. In this post, I’ll break down five common reasons why that growth sometimes stalls.
You risk becoming outdated if you’re not actively learning new frameworks, languages, or patterns. Reading documentation, experimenting with side projects, and staying curious are essential habits. Seniors don’t stop learning—they learn faster and more strategically.
Tip: Allocate a few hours each week to explore something new, even if it's outside your current stack.
It’s one thing to write code that works—it’s another to understand why it works and how it can be improved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[scnlib é uma biblioteca C++ moderna para substituir scanf e std::istream. Esta biblioteca tenta nos aproximar ainda mais da substituição completa de iostream
stdio em C.
É mais rápida que iostream e tipada, ao contrário de scanf. Pense em {fmt} ou em std::format em C++20, mas em outra direção.
Esta biblioteca é a implementação de referência da proposta de padrões ISO C++ P1729 "Análise de Texto".
Para compilar basta clonar com git e usar o CMake e instalar:
git clone https://github.com/eliaskosunen/scnlib
cd scnlib
cmake -B build .
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build

Após isso, já pode sair do repositório e removê-lo: cd .. && rm -rf scnlib.
Nesse exemplo, além da scnlib também há o uso o println do C++23, vamos ler 2 números via prompt e automaticamente será exibida a soma deles:
main.cpp
#include <scn/scan.h>
#include <print> 

constexpr auto sum = [](int x, int y){
  return x + y;
};

int main(){
  if(auto result =
      scn::prompt<int, int>("Informe 2 números para somar? ", "{} {}")) {
    auto [a, b] = result->values();
    std::println("A soma de {} mais {} é: {}", a, b, sum(a, b));
  }else{
    std::println(stderr, "Error: {}", result.error().msg());
  }
}

Para compilar use a flag: -lscn:
g++ main.cpp -lscn

E então, rode o binário e teste, exemplo:
./a.out
Informe 2 números para somar? 3 6
A soma de 3 mais 6 é: 9

When integrating files from a React application into an Oracle APEX application, developers often face issues with CSS not loading correctly due to relative paths. In your case, you mentioned that the CSS references media files using relative paths, causing them to not be found in the context of your APEX application. Let's explore why this issue occurs and how to resolve it effectively.
Understanding the Issue
The core of your problem lies in the way browsers resolve relative URLs in CSS files. In a typical React project, references to fonts or images (like media/f61b9.woff) are relative to the location of the CSS file itself. When you build your React application using npm run build, these paths are fixed based on the folder structure of the compiled output in the React app.…]]></summary>

So If you're familiar with docker containers so far (if not, read my previous two articles on this),
When there's more than 1 container, and they have to interact, there's some things you have to repeat, like:
pulling image & creating a container.
allocate volumes, pass ENV args, etc to container
have all containers running in same network
.

Now if there's 3,4,5,.. or more, it gets more hectic, see where this is going? Docker compose solves that, by "composing" up your containers config in a file type called "yaml" (its similar to json - a data format, usually for configs).
You still have things like Dockerfile and concepts of containers are the same, its just the process that's simpler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports.

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.

Farside Investors’ data shows that spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded cumulative net inflows of $142.3 million on May 7, in a sign of “sustained institutional interest,” according to the founder of Obchakevich Research, Alex Obchakevich.
“These inflows indicate the activity of institutional investors, including hedge funds and asset managers, who continue to accumulate BTC through regulated instruments,“ he said.
The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) led with $54 million in inflows, followed by Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) at $39 million and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) at $37 million. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows BlackRock acquired more t…]]></summary>

Instead, real-world use cases like student loans backed by DeFi may be crypto’s most convincing value proposition to date.

DeFi student loans
On April 30th, Pencil Finance, a project supported by Animoca Brands and its education arm Open Campus, announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative aimed at providing cheaper, blockchain-backed loans.

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana has yet to show convincing signs that it could surpass Ethereum as the preferred blockchain for institutions, as its revenue, heavily reliant on memecoins, is considered unstable, according to crypto bank group Sygnum.
In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.
Sygnum argued that institutions could choos…]]></summary>

The firm said on X on May 9 that it was making the cryptocurrency available to more than 100 million customers, adding that “the movement is just beginning,” before signing off as “Steaktoshi.” 
The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%.

Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows.
“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said.

A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.
The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.
