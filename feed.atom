A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

Fredrik Svantes, a protocol security research lead, and Josh Stark from the Ethereum Foundation management team will be the initial co-chairs of the initiative. Three contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem — samczsun, Medhi Zerouali, and Zach Obront — will help guide the project.
Called the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative, the effort seeks to analyze, improve, and communicate to Ethereum developers areas where security can be improved, including user experience, wallet security, smart contract security and infrastructure.

Let’s quickly look at why you might want a multi-step form:
Increases completion rates as users are more likely to finish shorter steps than one long form.


Improves UX: Long forms can overwhelm users. Breaking them into steps makes the process feel lighter.

We’ll build a multi-step form for creating a user profile with the following steps:
Personal Info (name, email)
Address Info (street, city, state)
We’ll implement this using only core Rails features — leveraging Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams from the Hotwire stack — to create dynamic, multi-step forms without full page reloads or third-party gems.

If you're working with nested lists in Python and want to extract values to perform addition based on dynamic user input, you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore a refined approach to your code, allowing for clarity and efficiency while managing a potentially indefinite number of categories.
Understanding the Problem
It looks like you're attempting to save values related to market share into a nested list structure and then perform simple additions on those values. However, using a nested list to store your dollar shares without clear indexing can make your computations cumbersome, especially when the number of categories is variable. This can lead to both logic errors and inefficient use of memory.

The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. 
The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin's all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. 
From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.
Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post, Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe's crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider:
“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Still, some industry observers remain cautious about the likelihood of near-term regulatory change.
“All three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment,”  Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of onchain data platform CryptoQuant, wrote in a May 14 X post.
Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investments are banned in South Korea, meaning that “100% [of the] volume comes from retail,” Ju added.

“Gold is getting very popular,” Amy Lo, the Swiss bank’s co-head of wealth management for Asia, said during Bloomberg’s New Voices event held in Hong Kong on May 13.
She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.

“Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.”
McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures.
