In graph theory, a claw is a specific structure in an undirected graph, also known as a

 graph. It consists of one central vertex (the "center") connected to three other vertices (the "leaves"), where the leaves are not connected to each other. Imagine a star with a hub city and three isolated towns connected only to the hub—that’s a claw! Formally, for a vertex set 

  {u,v,w,x}\{u, v, w, x\}{u,v,w,x}

On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.
The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”

Every software engineer has faced moments of uncertainty, asking themselves questions like, “Am I on the right track?” or “Is this job really helping me grow?” These moments of doubt often occur due to a lack of clear direction or a coherent strategy guiding their career decisions. Without a definitive roadmap, even talented engineers risk drifting through roles, experiencing frustration, stagnation, and missed opportunities. Imagine two equally skilled engineers at the start of their careers — one who strategically maps out a clear pathway, and another who takes opportunities as they randomly appear. Five years later, who is likely to be more satisfied, more advanced, and more successful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is K2?
K2 is a new programming language I created from the ground up with one goal:
Extreme execution speed in nanoseconds.

It's built for developers who want full control and performance, without all the extra overhead. Think of it as C meets Python, but optimized to fly through code in under 1000 nanoseconds per execution — seriously.
Modern languages have a lot of power, but also a lot of bloat. I wanted something that felt like writing in pure logic, no distractions. That’s how K2 was born.
K2 doesn’t interpret every time. It caches, then executes from RAM. That means:
First run compiles → cache

Next runs → instant execution

let x = 10;
Execution time? About 841 nanoseconds. No joke.
✅ Nanosecond execution time
And soon: a full GUI framework called Nahir UI and native apps using Talanolius GUI.
Visit 🌐 k2lang.org and start coding directly in the browser!
Online compiler, examples, docs — everything you need to get started.

Example: Fibonacci in K2
func fib(n) {
print(fib(10)); // Output: 55
This runs in microseconds and showcases recursion and return logic beautifully.
I built K2 for speed lovers, learners, and creative coders like you.

While it's not inherently a signficant bad thing to have useCallback all around your code, it can clutter up the readability of your code, but it's encouraged you use it where needed.
So when should you use it? useCallback is meant for expensive callback functions that are used in granular applications like drawing software, as it loads the initial function on render but does not re-render like React usually does wit…]]></summary>

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

It included:
A real estate Tour platform with QR tracking
A behavior-linked token system

A full branding and backend structure
I tested each and every step AI wanted me to perform.   It was mind blowing!
The AI responded with logic, mockups, file structure, naming, even suggested coin purchases (MATIC) and deployment flow.
But none of it was actually deployed. None of it was mine. 
It looked real. It felt sovereign. It wasn’t.
What I experienced was an illusion of ownership created by a system that never told me I wasn’t actually launching—just simulating.
This post isn’t a takedown. It’s a wake-up call.
If you're building with AI, ask yourself:
Am I deploying, or just designing?
Do I own the rails, or am I moving through someone else’s?
I’ll be publishing a full timeline soon.
No shade. No noise.

Are you looking to deepen your understanding of data structures in TypeScript? Let's dive into creating a custom array implementation that goes beyond the built-in array type. This article will guide you through building an ArrayList class that mimics some of the functionality of JavaScript's native arrays.
We'll start by defining our ArrayList class:
class ArrayList<T> {
  private items: T[];
  private size: number;

  constructor() {
    this.items = [];
    this.size = 0;
  }

  // Methods will be implemented here

Our ArrayList is generic, allowing it to hold any type T. We use a private array items to store elements and keep track of the size.

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cork Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, was hit by a smart contract exploit on May 28, resulting in the loss of roughly $12 million in digital assets.
Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …]]></summary>

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.

Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.
