Box<T> is a smart pointer that owns and stores its contents on the heap. It‚Äôs a core part of Rust‚Äôs ownership and memory management model, giving you fine control over data placement without sacrificing safety.
When you create a value with Box::new(x), Rust:
Allocates memory on the heap
Writes x into that memory
Returns a Box<T> that points to the heap
Box<T>



You need to store large data on the heap
You want to build recursive types (like trees or linked lists)
You‚Äôre working with trait objects and need dynamic dispatch (Box<dyn Trait>)
You want to transfer ownership safely across contexts

Want to know how Box<T> works internally? Here's a simplified, educational version:

I'll be creating my code snippets on Scribbler.live first, which is a fantastic platform that allows you to run a JavaScript Notebook, Online Compiler, and Editor without the need for manual setup.
Additionally, I am including a link to code snippets that includes all of the code examples so you can open the snippet and run it yourself to see the results.

Rather than just building the site, I decided to take it a step further by creating a reusable UI component library that's maintainable for the long term.
Say hello to astrobits.dev! It's still in its early stages, but I'm pretty excited about how it's shaping up. I've created GitHub issues for all the components I plan to add, giving me a clear roadmap for development.
One decision I'm particularly happy with was implementing BEM (Block Element Modifier) guidelines for all the styles, enforced through linting rules. If you're not familiar with BEM, it's a naming convention that creates a clear, strict structure for your CSS classes:

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly.
In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach.¬†

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create ‚Äúbits,‚Äù representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song‚Äôs approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and ‚Äúshifts complexity rather than eliminating it.‚Äù

Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption.¬†

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.

A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days.

Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Public internet infrastructure is the critical speed and performance constraint on high-throughput blockchain networks, according to Austin Federa, co-founder and CEO of DoubleZero, a project developing high-speed fiber optic communication rails for blockchains.
"The downside of the public internet is it was never built for high-performance systems. It was always built for this sort of relationship of one big server talking to one little server," Federa told Cointelegraph in an interview at Consensus 2025. The executive explained:
"We have validators all around the world. Rotating leader schedules all the time. And then they switch from having to be massive consumers of data to extremely massive broadcasters of data. So that means that they need huge amounts of resources both on ingress an‚Ä¶]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moody's credit rating agency downgraded the credit rating of the United States government from Aaa to Aa1, citing the rising national debt as the primary driver behind the reduction in creditworthiness.
According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."
The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the c‚Ä¶]]></summary>
