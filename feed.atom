Websites and apps are no longer simple. People want smart, interactive, and personalized experiences. That's why learning Python, JavaScript, and AI together is so important.
Python is great for building the "behind-the-scenes" parts of apps and is also a top choice for AI because it has many helpful tools.


JavaScript is what makes websites look good and easy to use. It can also be used for the backend (with Node.js), which helps in building the whole app.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! If you’re learning JavaScript or just want to code smarter (not harder), I’ve got some handy tips and tricks with examples that are easy to get — and maybe even a little fun.
Ready to speed up your JavaScript game? Let’s jump in!
const hungry = true;
const food = hungry ? 'Order pizza!' : 'Keep coding!';

console.log(food);  // Order pizza!

Why?
function gift(name = 'Friend') {
  console.log(`Here’s a gift for you, ${name}!`);
}

gift();          // Here’s a gift for you, Friend!
gift('Alex');    // Here’s a gift for you, Alex!

Why?
const person = {
  firstName: 'Sam',
  lastName: 'Smith',
  age: 25
};

const { firstName, age } = person;
console.log(`${firstName} is ${age} years old.`);  // Sam is 25 years old.

Why?
const pet = 'dog';
const petName = 'Buddy';

const sentence = `My ${pet} is called ${petName} and he loves belly rubs.`;
console.log(sentence);

Why?
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
console.log(multiply(4, 5));  // 20

Why?
const userInput = '';
const defaultText = userInput || 'Please type something!';
console.log(defaultText);  // Please type something!

Why?
const veggies = ['carrot', 'broccoli'];
const moreVeggies = [...veggies, 'spinach'];

console.log(moreVeggies);  // ['carrot', 'broccoli', 'spinach']

Why?
const scores = [3, 6, 9];
const funScores = scores.map(score => `You scored ${score} points! Yay!`);
console.log(funScores);

Why?
const car = { model: 'Tesla' };
console.log(car.owner?.name || 'Owner unknown');  // Owner unknown

Why?
const snacks = ['chips', 'cookies', 'pretzels'];

for (const snack of snacks) {
  console.log(`I love ${snack}!`);
}

Why?
Easier to loop through arrays than with old-fashioned for loops. Plus, you get to shout your love for snacks!]]></summary>

Whether it’s live collaboration in Notion, ride-tracking in Uber, real-time chat in WhatsApp, or stock updates in Robinhood—**instant feedback isn’t just a feature; it's the norm.
But here's the real question:
Let’s break down how you can get your backend real-time ready — and why this matters more than ever in 2025.

Users are conditioned by lightning-fast platforms. They expect:
Instant notifications
Live content updates
Realtime collaboration (like Google Docs)
Seamless communication
Failing to deliver this? You risk bounce rates, poor UX, and losing users to more responsive competitors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There’s an old joke about the stock market: If you want to make a small fortune, start with a large one. It’s the kind of gallows humor that traders sip their tea over, staring out at the flickering screens of their Bloomberg terminals. But in our age of algorithms and all-powerful machine learning models, the old wisdom is being rewritten — or at least, that’s what the quants would like us to believe.
The idea that artificial intelligence can consistently beat the market is both seductive and, frankly, a little terrifying. Because if it’s true, then what are we doing here, with our frantic chart analysis, our fevered option plays, our futile attempts to time the Fed’s next move?
Let’s start with a dose of humility (which, let’s be honest, the financial world could use a bit more of). AI, or at least the kind we worship today, isn’t some all-knowing oracle whispering stock picks from the depths of a silicon godhead. It’s math. Really complicated, computationally expensive math, but math nonetheless. And as any philosophy student who spent too much time reading Sartre in a college library can tell you, math does indeed have limits.
🤖 The Rise of AI in Trading
These systems excel in:
Speed: Executing trades in milliseconds to capitalize on fleeting opportunities.
Downtrend Markets: AI-driven funds have demonstrated superior risk-adjusted performance during market downturns, effectively mitigating downside risks.
🧠 Limitations of AI in Trading
Overfitting: AI models trained on historical data may not adapt well to unforeseen market events.
Augmented Decision-Making: AI can handle data-heavy tasks, allowing humans to focus on strategic decisions.

Those arrested include several minors, with charges against them including kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and criminal conspiracy, Le Parisien reported on May 26.
French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.
In one recent alleged kidnapping attempt on May 13, three men tried to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, in broad daylight in Paris.

The World Robot Competition Mecha Fighting Series had four human-controlled robots built by China-based firm Unitree compete in three, two-minute rounds with winners crowned through a points system, according to a May 26 report from the China state-owned outlet the Global Times. 
Chen Xiyun, a Unitree team member, said the “robots fight in a human-machine collaborative way,” with the machines pre-taught moves, but ultimately, a person controls the bot’s movements.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.

“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:
"Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”
BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex co…]]></summary>

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a ‘bad idea’
Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the invest…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Traders are watching today’s volumes to see if emerging intraday trends are followed at the US open on May 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittensor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.
That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.
DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund …]]></summary>

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index).
