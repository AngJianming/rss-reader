Modern web browsers ship with a growing number of powerful, native JavaScript APIs that let developers build more dynamic, performant, and user-friendly applications — no external libraries required. 
In this post, we’ll explore six of these APIs: structuredClone, EyeDropper,  AbortController, Intersection Observer, ResizeObserver, and the Clipboard API. For each, we’ll explain what problems it solves, when to use it, and how to implement it. Before we dive in, it’s important to know why these APIs aren’t more widely known, despite how useful they are:
  They’re relatively new: Many of these APIs have only been introduced recently. In the meantime, mature and popular npm packages have already become the go-to alternatives

However, most LLM-based AI applications in the past few years have primarily dealt with text data. This is because embedding models and LLMs, until recently, were focused mainly on text. But this is changing— LLMs like Gemini and GPT-4o can now process and generate images, audio, and video. Vendors like Voyage AI and Cohere have multimodal embedding models that can embed both images and text. This means we are no longer limited to using just text in our LLM applications.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a RAG application using documents consisting of interleaved text, images, and tables as their source of knowledge. Specifically, we will cover the following:

A single outage in a banking app can cost millions. 
In early 2025, Barclays experienced a major mobile banking outage, with estimated compensation costs ranging from £5 million to £7.5 million. This shows how disruptions can lead to significant financial and trust consequences.
As more customers shift to mobile-first banking, expectations for speed, uptime, and security continue to rise. Every tap, login, and transaction must work as expected across devices, operating systems, and network conditions.
To meet these demands while staying compliant with strict data privacy regulations, banks are moving toward a more controlled setup: on-premises device labs.

with-next-sass - This official next.js example demonstrates how to use Next.js' built-in Global Sass/Scss imports  and Component-Level Sass/Scss modules support.
This stackoverflow answears helped me.
Nextjs has built in sapport for sass. To use component isolated .sass or .scss files you need to install sass.
npm install sass

To configure sass compiler you can use sassOptions in next.config.js. nextjs.org/#customizing-sass-options
For instance, if you want to load assets from styles like @font-face src and have different locations on prod and dev environments, you can do the following:
In next config set assetPrefix depending on the environment. Then, add sassOptions variable.
// next.config.js

module.exports = (phase) => {
  // when started in development mode `next dev` or `npm run dev`
  const isDev = phase === PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER;
  // when `next build` or `npm run build` is used
  const isProd = phase === PHASE_PRODUCTION_BUILD;

  const assetPrefix = isProd ? '/prod' : '/';

  const sassOptions = {
    prependData: `$prefix: "${assetPrefix}";`,
  }

  ... // Other configuration

  return {
    ...
    sassOptions
  };
}

In .scss files now you can use this prefix variable to prepend import paths.
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Open-Sans';
  src: url("#{$prefix}fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf");]]></summary>

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

Paws is a Telegram-based Mini App created by the same team behind other projects, such as Notcoin and Dogs. 
If you’ve been cruising around Telegram lately, chances are you’ve stumbled upon Paws, the viral crypto Mini App that’s got everyone tapping, clicking and inviting their friends like it’s 2010 FarmVille all over again.

The move brings 1inch’s Fusion protocol to Solana for the first time. Fusion enables users to define their ideal swap parameters, which are then executed by competing professional market makers, or “resolvers,” using Dutch auction mechanics.

Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins, regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28.
The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them.
He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Ethereum Foundation, which backs the development of the Ethereum blockchain, has overhauled its leadership structure to separate the responsibilities of its management team and board of directors.
The board will act as the “security council to protect the heart and soul” of the foundation and set visions for Ethereum, while the new management will be focused on the strategic and operational execution of those visions, the Foundation said in an April 28 blog post.
It added in an April 28 X post that Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were appointed as co-executive directors on March 2 to deliver on those visions — which are centered around championing censorship resistance, open-source innovation, privacy and security
Wang and Stańczak’s roles took effect on April 28 with the foundat…]]></summary>

Bitcoin gained 10% over the past week, but overhead resistance continues to obstruct a rally to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below.

Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst
The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.
