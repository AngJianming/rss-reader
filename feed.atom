        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you missed it, Arm dropped a major update at GDC 2025 (March 17–21) — introducing Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR), a game-changing upscaling solution for mobile.
ASR is a temporal upscaling technique designed to optimize mobile game performance by rendering at lower resolutions and then upscaling frames, saving on GPU usage and battery life, while maintaining crisp visuals.
Inspired by AMD’s FSR2, it’s built specifically for mobile and is now open-sourced under the MIT license.
Up to 53% more FPS on Arm Immortalis-G720 GPU
~20% lower power draw during 2x upscaling
Compatible with Unreal Engine 5.3–5.5 (Unity plugin coming soon)
Dev-friendly: Comes with documentation, examples, and plug-ins
Check out the official GitHub repo (via Arm)
Dive into the technical docs
Start experimenting with ASR in your next mobile build
For the ones who missed this update, this could be the turning point in balancing performance and power for mobile gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You know what sucks?
Bundling.
Install react → ends up in node_modules/, goes through Vite/Rollup/webpack, gets transpiled, hashed, minified… just so you can write:

import React from 'react';


But what if you didn’t need a bundler at all?
Import Maps are a native browser feature (yep, no polyfill needed in modern Chromium) that let you map bare module specifiers to real URLs — directly in the browser.
Here’s the magic:
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18",
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18"
  }
}
</script>


Now, in your <script type="module">, you can write:
import React from "react";

And the browser knows where to get it, no bundler, no build step, no CDN script tags.
No build step: Instant dev workflow
No node_modules/: Zero install, zero bloat
Works with CDNs like Skypack, ESM.sh, JSPM
Great for micro frontends, prototypes, and fast loading islands
Not supported in all browsers yet
→ Mostly just Chromium for now. Firefox is dragging. Safari? Radio silence.
(You can polyfill it, but it kills the whole “zero tooling” idea.)
Tooling momentum is too big
→ Everyone already uses Vite, webpack, etc. Import Maps don’t fit the current “npm install + dev server” mindset.
No ecosystem support
→ Most tutorials, libraries, and docs assume you're bundling. Period.
Import Maps shine when you want:
No build tools at all
To prototype quickly
To ship something truly small
To combine multiple micro-apps without a monolith
They’re especially useful with:
Web components
Vanilla JS apps
Islands architecture setups (Astro, Marko, etc.)
JAMstack sites that want dynamic bits without bundling
Import Maps don’t want to replace your build system.
They’re just saying: "Hey... you might not need one."
They're not mainstream (yet), but they offer a glimpse at a simpler frontend world — one where browsers do more and you ship less.
Worth keeping an eye on.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microservices have been a topic that has been revolving in my mind for some time. I wanted to find out what the big deal is behind all of that.
Microservices is an architecture where we create a system with loosely coupled services each that can be scaled in isolation.
Microservices talk to each other via protocols like HTTP, gRPC etc.
Each MS can be individually deployed and has its own database. So total isolation. But it comes with the overhead of managing each one too. There is also the problem that now databases can't have foreign key relationships.
It is a good way to show separation of concerns as the microservices are totally isolated.
The key component is the API gateway which acts as a proxy to the services. Everything hits the gateway and is then routed.
Last but not the least, it is not meant for small projects. It is best for large teams with each micro-team working on a micro-service.
So I went out to make it happen and get over with the fuss once and for all. Like always I went ahead with my most favourite thing in the world - a todo application.
Here is the architecture
User Domain - a user micro-service that creates and gets users.
Todo Domain - a todo micro-service that adds and fetches todo items for the users
API Gateway - a gateway that acts as a proxy and routes requests.
Here is the code

Below is a basic but powerful checklist covering essential security testing practices — from authentication issues to privilege escalation, credential leaks, and pivoting.
1. Authentication & Authorization



  
  
  Hardcoded Credentials



Check for credentials hardcoded in client-side code, headers, request bodies, or exposed through misconfigured API documentation.
Try common combinations like admin:admin or test:test. Many APIs still ship with default credentials that are never changed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's start with the basics. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is simply a unique address that allows you to find a particular page, file or resource on the web. By typing in a URL in your browser, you end up exactly where you want to go - whether it's to a shop homepage, a blog article or an image. Without URLs, the internet would be a pure chaos, because there would be no way to pinpoint where the content is.
What is a URL and what does it consist of?
If you're wondering: what is a URL and what does it look like, it's worth knowing that each URL is made up of several elements:
a protocol (usually https or http)
domain (e.g. twojastrona.pl)
path (e.g. /blog/what-to-address-url)
sometimes parameters (e.g. ?sort=desc)
excerpt (e.g. #section1)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the early stage of a new development language’s birth, due to its own characteristics and the relatively small number of users, it is prone to some problems that are not easy for people to understand, or there are some pitfalls. Today, I will share in detail the relevant content about log printing in the Cangjie development language and help you get through the pitfalls.

Unlike ArkTs, there is no console.log in the Cangjie language. Here, AppLog.info is used.

Ultimately, it was found that the content printed by AppLog could only be seen on the real device and not on the emulator.

So, what exactly is AppLog and why does this problem occur?

It can be seen that AppLog is still based on the encapsulation of Hilog, and the console of DevEco prints the content of Hilog. Moreover, as the recommended printing method in the initialization code, it cannot be printed in the simulator. I can only understand this as a pitfall.

Hilog
Hilog.info(0x0000, 'hello hilog', 'this is an info level log');

At this point, logs can be printed normally in the simulator.

print

This method can be printed normally in vscode. println is an encapsulation based on print, so using print here is equally effective.
println and print can also be written in DevEco, but they cannot be printed because DevEco can only print the content of Hilog, and print has no relation to Hilog.
The above is the log printing in the Cangjie development language. I hope it will be helpful to everyone.]]></summary>

  What Are Composite Primary Keys?


Imagine you're trying to identify a specific student in a class. Instead of just using their student ID, you might need both their student ID AND the class they're in to uniquely identify them. That's exactly what composite primary keys do in databases! They combine multiple pieces of information to create a unique identifier that makes perfect sense in the real world.
Django's Historical Limitation with Primary Keys


For years, Django developers had to work around a frustrating limitation: the framework only supported single-column primary keys. It was like trying to identify a book using just its ISBN, when sometimes you really need both the ISBN AND the edition number to be absolutely sur…]]></summary>

However, Blackstone’s investment, reported in a May 20 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only totaled around $1.08 million — a fraction of the asset manager’s $1.2 trillion portfolio.
Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) as of March 31.
The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, Google Finance data shows.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam.
“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.
In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.
According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to annou…]]></summary>

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.

Built on Avalanche, Fusion features a two-layer architecture that includes composers, customizable layer-1 networks and modules, which offer plug-and-play services like compute, identity and data oracles. 
The team said this approach would be the answer for mainstream adoption, as they attempt to deliver “outcome-driven, domain-specific” blockchain-based economies. 
“In order to achieve widespread adoption, our industry needs to shift from selling blockspace to delivering business value,” a Fusion spokesperson told Cointelegraph. They added that Fusion integrates economic alignment, network design and compo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India’s Supreme Court questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.
According to the Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the increasing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, which remain largely unregulated.
“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.
“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.…]]></summary>

Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.
Binance rejects this claim, stating that “…]]></summary>

According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.
