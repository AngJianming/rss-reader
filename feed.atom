        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[APIs are essential for enabling communication between software systems. Over time, several popular methods have emerged — each with its own strengths and trade-offs. From the well-established SOAP protocol to modern approaches like GraphQL and gRPC, understanding these popular API communication styles helps developers choose the right tool for their needs. Let’s take a quick look at the five most popular ways APIs communicate today.
In short, it’s a protocol that enables developers to invoke methods on remote objects or services. It’s a pretty old dinosaur, both in terms of age and weight. It’s based on XML, which means it carries a lot of text — much more than REST or GraphQL.
It was invented a long time ago and is known for being very secure, strict, and reliable. If you compare them lik…]]></summary>

“How do you approach code reviews as a tech lead?”
This question may seem tactical on the surface, but in reality, it reveals a lot about your engineering judgment, system thinking, and leadership philosophy.
Here's how I answer it, and how I actually approach code reviews in real-world teams.
1. Design Comes First
Does this solution align with our overall system architecture?


Is it scalable, extensible, and testable?


Does it follow the design principles and patterns we agreed on as a team?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deploying applications consistently across different CI/CD tools is a skill every engineer should master. This article focuses on how to use GitLab CI/CD to deploy a full stack Docker Compose application to Koyeb, a developer-friendly PaaS.
If you’ve already followed our GitHub Actions deployment guide for the same project, you’re in the right place. We won’t rehash the application structure, Dockerfiles, or Docker Compose file — those details remain unchanged. Instead, this guide zeroes in on the CI/CD configuration differences specific to GitLab.
You’ll learn how to:
Set up your .gitlab-ci.yml file for Docker Compose deployments.
Use the Koyeb CLI within GitLab runners.
Trigger deployments by pushing to the main branch.
Monitor and debug deployment from GitLab’s UI.

I've seen it said in various places (citations lost, please roll with it) that Go is a good replacement for shell scripting. At first, I was highly skeptical - Go is a compliled, stricly typed language with more boilerplate to "Hello world" than needed in any scirpting language. But as a compiled language, it does make sense for portability, and as a properly and strictly typed language, it makes performing complex operations easier to implement... so it was worth trying out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: AI is about to supercharge hackers’ abilities—what security pros are calling “vibe hacking.” Tools like XBOW are already auto-scanning and exploiting web flaws, and purpose-built or jailbroken LLMs (think WormGPT, FraudGPT, even ChatGPT clones) can spit out malicious code with a simple prompt. As generative models get smarter, virtually anyone—even script-kiddies—can tell AI “cook me up an exploit” and watch the malware roll off the assembly line.
The real worry, though, is seasoned cybercriminals using AI to scale attacks they already know inside out. What used to take days of tinkering can now be done in 30 minutes, supercharging zero-day strikes, polymorphic malware, and mass automated break-ins. While OpenAI, Anthropic, and others keep tightening guardrails (and even offer bug bounties for jailbreak hunters), the arms race is on—and the next big cyber nightmare might just be an AI prompt away.]]></summary>

We built GoConnect’s Idea Hub to fix that.
It’s a space designed for people who think, build, and care about getting real feedback — without the noise of hype posts or social algorithms getting in the way.
The Idea Hub is a new feature on GoConnect, where you can share product ideas — big or small — and start conversations around them. It’s not about “launching” or pitching. It’s about early-stage thinking, honest feedback, and finding collaborators.
Whether it’s:
A napkin sketch of a dev tool,
A question about a potential SaaS feature,
Or just something you’re not sure is worth building yet…
The Idea Hub gives you a pla…]]></summary>
