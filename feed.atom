Your infrastructure could be bulletproof. Your application could be cloud-native. But can your system handle unpredictable traffic spikes, cascading failures, or regional outages? That’s where resilience testing steps in.
What Is Resilience Testing?
Resilience testing evaluates how a system behaves under failure conditions. It doesn’t just ask “Does it work?” but “What happens when it breaks?”
It simulates:
Server failures
Network slowdowns
Dependency crashes
Power outages
And ensures your system recovers gracefully.
Why Is It Important?
Modern architectures rely on distributed systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure. These are fast and scalable but also more complex and interdependent.
Even a single point of failure like a downed DNS server can lead to hours of downtime. Resilience testing identifies weak links before your users do.
Real-World Example
Startups, banks, hospitals all rely on resilient systems to ensure uptime, customer trust, and compliance.
What Should You Test?
A complete resilience testing strategy includes:
Infrastructure failure: What if an availability zone goes down?
Application failure: What if a microservice crashes?
Network instability: Can services handle latency?
Resource exhaustion: How does your system behave under stress?
Best Practices
Introduce failures gradually.
Monitor everything latency, error rates, recovery times.
Use automated tools like Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.
Always run post-mortems to fix root causes.
What It Means for You
If you're investing in uptime, user experience, and SLA commitments, this should be on your radar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s say you have a service that, in response to some event, performs a series of operations that can’t be wrapped into an atomic transaction. For example, this service might integrate with an accounting system and, in response to a sale event, create an invoice (Step 1) and send that invoice to a customer (Step 2). If either of these two steps fails, the entire sale event processing should be retried. However, if Step 1 succeeds, but emailing the invoice fails, we obviously should retry only the email step and not create a duplicate invoice.
The idea is simple: persist the status of each processing step (e.g. invoice creation and emailing) in a database, and during a retry, resume from the failed step.
These statuses will be fetched from the database using an ID derived from the received…]]></summary>

In this guide, we’ll set up a 2-of-3 multisig account on the Aptos blockchain — three owners, two required approvals — then walk through proposing, approving, and executing a transaction.
More Secure: One compromised key won’t risk funds
Shared Control: No single point of failure
Great for DAOs: Ideal for team-managed funds
Fewer Mistakes: Multiple signers catch errors
Aptos CLI installed
Basic blockchain knowledge

  Introduction


In the realm of front-end development, performance optimizations are paramount for creating smooth, responsive user experiences. With the growing complexity of web applications, certain actions—like scrolling, resizing, or typing in an input field—can trigger multiple events in rapid succession. This is where the concepts of debounce and throttle come into play. Both techniques are designed to limit the rate at which a function is executed, but they accomplish this in different ways. This article aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, their historical context, and their practical implementations in JavaScript.

If your Gunicorn is running under a systemd service (e.g., tunaresq_be.service), the easiest way to view logs is with journalctl.
sudo journalctl -u tunaresq_be.service -e

-u tunaresq_be.service: Filters logs for your service.

sudo journalctl -u tunaresq_be.service -f
