The central bank said it aims to explore programmability and offline capabilities for the digital rupee — features that could increase its applicability in areas with limited internet access and tailor payments for specific use cases such as government subsidies or corporate spending controls.
Currently, both versions of the CBDC are undergoing pilot testing. The e₹-Retail pilot is being conducted with select customers and merchants through participating banks, while the e₹-Wholesale pilot is targeting u…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’ve all been there.
You’re in the shower, or walking down the street, or lying in bed — and boom — an amazing idea hits you.
At that moment, your brain lights up. You can almost see the app, the startup, the product, or the system. You start mentally walking through how it would work, what problem it solves, maybe even what you'd call it.
But then what happens?
You jot a few notes in a phone app. Maybe a Google Doc. Maybe it ends up in a messy Notion page or a sticky note.
📌 What Do Most of Us Do Next?


You try to revisit it a week later — but the clarity is gone.
You stare at your own notes thinking, “What was I trying to say?”
Some of us try to document it more thoroughly. Maybe you open a new doc and write:
"What is this idea about?", "Who is it for?", "How would I build it?"
But even then — it’s hard.
😤 It’s Frustrating, Isn’t It?


You're not alone.
Capturing an idea is easy.
Especially when:
You don’t want to lose the creative flow.
You want to make it presentable (maybe to a friend, mentor, or co-founder).
You want to keep everything in one place.
💭 What If There Was a Better Way?


What if you could:
Dump your raw thoughts and let AI help you expand on them?
Auto-generate a structured document that explains your idea like a pro?
Watch a flowchart or diagram build itself alongside your writing?
See everything stay in sync — text, visuals, ideas — without juggling 5 tools?
Imagine being able to go from spark → structure → shareable format — in one workspace.
Wouldn't that save you time?
🚀 Maybe It’s Time We Stop Losing Good Ideas


Because good ideas deserve more than a dusty corner of your notes app.
They deserve a space that thinks with you, structures for you, and visualizes alongside you.
Not just another tool. But a creative system.
One that finally lets your ideas breathe.
What would you create if your brainstorming process actually helped you build?]]></summary>

🛠 DevTools & Console Highlights:
console.log(), console.warn(), console.error(), console.info for messaging


console.table() — super helpful for visualizing arrays/objects


console.group() and console.groupCollapsed() — useful for organizing logs


console.time() / console.timeEnd() for performance checks


console.assert() — throws only when a condition is false


console.clear — clears the console



These little tools can save you hours of debugging when you're working on bigger projects.
messaging:

console.log('hello');

Visualizing array/objects:

        const dogs = [


Organizing logs:

        const dogs = [
${dog.name})
This is ${dog.name})
${dog.name} is ${dog.age} years old)
${dog.name})


Time: 

        console.time('fetching data');

.assert: 

console.assert(1 === 2, 'That is wrong!');


clear the console: 
console.clear()
You can check out all of these examples in my GitHub: Ubba's repo for more info.
These tools are super important and helpful, there are absolutely more tools, a quick search in MDN or any other platform would give more information.

But somewhere between connecting APIs and mapping data fields, things... spiraled. Duplicate contacts. Missing leads. A rogue sales rep named "Todd" who somehow had four different entries in four tools.
I laughed. Then cried. Then considered becoming a barista.

When clients approach a development team, they’ve often already put significant thought into their vision. They have a clear mental image of the final product, and sometimes even clear goals and success metrics. These ideas typically translate into functional requirements, such as:
"The product should include a supplier account with X and Y capabilities."
"We need an app where users can apply for banking products."

A key stipulation, however, is that these products must not involve the “actual delivery of cryptocurrencies,” the Bank of Russia emphasized.
The announcement came alongside the Bank of Russia reporting a 51% increase in crypto asset inflows by Russian residents in the first quarter of 2025, totaling 7.3 trillion rubles ($81.5 billion).

In a post referencing Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, Arkham claimed that it had identified an additional 70,816 BTC linked to the company. At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.
Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total identified holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm.

Ether’s price outperforms the wider crypto market with 4% gains over the last 24 hours to hit a three-month high of $2,789 on May 29. 

ETH record open interest, rising funding rates and consistent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs fuel the rally.

A classic bullish continuation pattern suggests a potential 46% climb toward $4,000 as ETH reclaims key support.


Ether’s (ETH) price topped $2,780 on May 29 for the first time since Feb. 24. 
Ether was trading at $2,722 at the time of publication, up more than 4% in the last 24 hours and 50% over the last 30 days. Its daily trading volume has jumped 10% to $26.5 billion, suggesting increasing trader interest in the altcoin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
The May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.
Instead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. 
“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.
The letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.
Favorable regulatory environment
The SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.
Atkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.

The following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.
In a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Adams pledged to advocate for and support the creation of municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin (BTC).
“We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.
“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.
“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. 
The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.
Court “blows a hole in trade talks”
Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”
Bitcoin’s (BTC) current all-time high of $111,970 was reached on May 22, but it has since fallen to trade around $107,750, according to CoinMarke…]]></summary>

The strength of Bitcoin’s (BTC) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. 
“This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” 
Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold.

Musk’s status as a Special Government Employee leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) meant that by law, he could only serve for a maximum of 130 days, which was set to finish on May 30.
Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”
Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”

“If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. 
He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator.

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

Crypto vulnerable if CFTC not given authority: Ex-chair Behnam
Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam said on May 28 that the crypto market will remain unregulated unless the agency he led is given greater authority.
Behnam argued in a Bloomberg TV interview that “the few largest tokens are commodities” and the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot properly regulate crypto because it can’t regulate commodities and the CFTC can’t regulate crypto because it is a derivatives regulator.

On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.
The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Conduit, a cross-border payments company based in Boston, has raised $36 million in a Series A funding round led by Dragonfly and Altos Ventures. The capital will go to scale its payment system and expand currency offerings across fiat and stablecoins.
Conduit markets its payment system as an alternative to the messaging network SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Banks have relied on the SWIFT protocol to process wire transfers since the 1970s. 
Conduit claims its platform offers a modern alternative, enabling near real-time cross-border settlements by combining stablecoins with local fiat currencies through crypto infrastructure.
“Traditional cross-border payment systems do not meet the demands of modern businesses,” Kirill Gertman, Conduit CEO, said i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. 
A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 20…]]></summary>
