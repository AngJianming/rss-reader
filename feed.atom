According to a May 7 Bloomberg report based on an analysis of the top TRUMP tokenholders, 19 of the top 25 wallets on the leaderboard used foreign exchanges that exclude US-based customers, suggesting either foreign nationals or Americans living abroad. In addition, more than half of the top 220 holders — the group eligible to apply for a dinner with the president — also used exchanges in other countries.

A bad connection strategy can lead to memory leaks, crashes, or endless retry loops.
In this blog, I’ll show you how I built a resilient Redis integration in Express.js using ioredis, lazy loading, and a circuit breaker with opossum.

At first, I used the classic approach:
const redis = new Redis(); // 🤷‍♂️ at the top level

But I quickly ran into issues:
Connection errors on startup if Redis wasn’t ready.
Too many retry attempts without a proper limit.
No fallback strategy during Redis downtime.
So, I rebuilt the entire integration with three key ideas:
✅ Lazy Loading
instead of connecting at startup, I created a singleton getter that initializes Redis on first use:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functional programming has gained traction in modern development due to its ability to produce more predictable, modular, and testable code. In this post, we explore four fundamental principles: immutability, function composition, pure functions, and arrow functions.
Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of mutating data, we return new versions with the desired updates.
✅ Why is it useful?
Prevents unpredictable side effects
Easier debugging and testing
Ideal for concurrent environments (like React or Redux)
❌ Mutable example:
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
user.age = 26; // Mutation

✅ Immutable example:
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };

We’re entering the post-smartphone era. Not with a bang, but through quiet disruption. And it’s already on your body.

The Rise of the Wearable Web
I wear a smartwatch that tracks my health, receives notifications, and lets me respond instantly.
Samsung just launched a smart ring — one more layer of ambient computing wrapped around our daily lives.
And of course, I can speak to an AI assistant and get intelligent, contextual responses without touching a screen.
This is no longer sci-fi — this is now.

A New Hub: The Invisible Puck
Imagine:
A tiny 5G/6G puck lives in your backpack
Your glasses are your screen
Your ring is your security token
Your watch handles notifications and health
Voice becomes your primary interface
AI becomes your operating system
No more swiping. No more “app folders”. No more trying to type with your thumb while walking.
Screens Are Becoming Optional
Even today, I can ask my glasses to play a song, call someone, or answer a question — all without touching a smartphone. I don’t need a “phone” to live connected. I just need smart inputs, wearable endpoints, and a cloud intelligence layer.
What This Means
App developers will have to rethink interaction: conversational, contextual, multi-device.
Privacy, identity, and edge computing will take centre stage — because the phone as a walled garden will be gone.
We’ll be more present — or at least, less distracted by rectangles.

The Debate Begins
Will we embrace ambient computing — or push back against losing physical control?
One thing’s clear: the era of staring at your hand all day is giving way to something new.
So here’s the question:
Would you give up your phone if you could wear the web instead?]]></summary>

But sometimes, I need to tap into the power of AWS for testing, dev work, or hybrid projects. In this post, I’m spilling the beans on how I bridged my home network with two AWS regions (ap-south-1 and us-east-1) using Tailscale, EC2, and VPC Peering. The result? A secure, low-latency network that feels like magic. Let’s dive in!
My home lab is my sandbox for coding, experimenting, and breaking things (gently).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a lot of noise on "MCP (Model Context Protocol)" and as someone at the forefront of technology we have no choice but to follow it up. Often, despite the initial waryneess the AI hype drains my energy, some careful study turns out to generate useful insights.
MCP is a protocol, but the majority of the protocol work is already done when OpenAI annouced tool use for ChatGPT. What matters now is the standardization process of the publisher of MCP, i.e. Anthropic (Creator of Claude models and tools). In addition to the publications, MCP offers server/client implementations for C#, Python, JavaScript - and that can speed up and streamline the development process.
Whenever an experienced developers sees the tool use API (e.g. from OpenAI), they will immediately think of automatic code generation and streamline and tool definition process, and develop custom tooling to define those tools and serve those tools. MCP offers a ready-to-use (language-of-your-choice) implementation for a stated server.
But here is a critical observation: does MCP has anything to do with AI/LLM at all? It's reinforcing what should have already been done: making systems reflective and accessible from an outside system. Here is a pun: it requires existing systems to be more reasonable (also see Forbes article on GEO).
Traditionally, when a software is developed if the original developer doesn't expose useful APIs then power users have no obvious way of automating it, except through the more hacky GUI automation route. Now with the pressure of AI, vendors have to expose useful interface. LLM with its natural language nature makes it easiser for them to pick, compared to picking a more specific scripting language (or rest API), especially when the MCP server/client framework is stated and uses JsonRPC.

TDD = Test-Driven Development

BDD = Behavior-Driven Development
BDD is all about the following mindset: Do not test code. Test behavior.
So it's a shift of the testing mindset. This is why in BDD, we also introduced new terms:
Test suites become specifications,
Test cases become scenarios,
We don't test code, we verify behavior.
Let's make this clear by an example.
If you are not familiar with Java, look in the repo files for other languages (I've added: Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, Go).

Did you know many amazing remote job openings never make it to big platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed? Instead, they’re tucked away on company job boards powered by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Today, I’m sharing a simple trick to uncover these hidden opportunities using Google search operators plus a tool to make it even easier.
Companies use ATS platforms to manage their job listings, and these platforms often have predictable URL patterns. By combining Google’s "site:" operator with keywords like "remote", you can find these jobs directly. Here’s how:
Greenhouse: site:boards.greenhouse.io "remote"
Lever: site:jobs.lever.co "remote"
Workday: site:wd5.myworkdayjobs.com "remote"
...and so many other ATS platforms.
Want something specific? Add a job title, like:
site:boards.greenhouse.io "remote" "software engineer"
You can also use the Google search tool to filter the latest job postings

This works for tons of ATS platforms (Jobvite, iCIMS, Taleo, etc.) and beats scrolling through crowded job boards.
Now, searching each ATS manually can take time, especially if you’re targeting multiple platforms or roles. That’s why I built FlexHired. It’s a remote job aggregator where I’ve hand curated a list of companies hiring remotely (with the tip above) and pulled their ATS listings into one place. With FlexHired, you can search and filter remote jobs effortlessly no Google (maybe, haha) gymnastics required.
Check it out at https://flexhired.com/remote-jobs if you want to save time and find your next remote gig faster. Currently, FlexHired has 440 companies and more than 8,000 open remote jobs.
Hope this helps, happy hunting!]]></summary>

ChatGPT uses advanced machine learning algorithms to generate responses. During a conversation, it can remember what you've said within the same chat session, which helps it respond in a way that feels coherent and warm.
Works:
• Arts, Design, and Media: Creating digital art, illustrations, music, audio, scripts, stories, and animations
• Content Creation: Writing blogs, articles, marketing content, personal emails, and social media posts
• Customer Service: Powering AI-based chatbots6
Data Analysis: Assisting with data analysis tasks6.
generative AI does not typically produce identical copies of the data it was trained on; its purpose is to create something new....

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $95,000 and institutional adoption starting to catch on, the mood among investors has shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook. 
“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.
Source: Ethereum.org
EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.
Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially signif…]]></summary>

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has reportedly become the latest presidential candidate to promise the approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other crypto-friendly measures, should he be elected.
Lee announced his crypto promises on May 6 as part of a broader initiative to provide more investment opportunities for Korea’s youth, one of the main target demographics for the fast-approaching June 3 election.
“I will create a safe investment environment so that young people can [build] assets and plan for the future,” The Korea Economic Daily (KED) quoted Lee as saying in Korean.
He also promised the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, lower transaction fees, and more consumer protection measures.
Lee’s Democratic Party of Korea is the favorite to win the pr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. 
With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states. 
“This will allow World Liberty Financial to validate the technical functionality of its airdrop system in a live environmen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.
The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit…]]></summary>

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.
