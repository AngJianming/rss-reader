mkdir -p "/data/safeline"
cd "/data/safeline"
wget "https://waf-ce.chaitin.cn/release/latest/compose.yaml"

# Edit environment variables
vi .env

.env sample:
SAFELINE_DIR=/data/safeline
IMAGE_TAG=latest
MGT_PORT=9443
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword
SUBNET_PREFIX=172.22.222
IMAGE_PREFIX=swr.cn-east-3.myhuaweicloud.com/chaitin-safeline
ARCH_SUFFIX=
RELEASE=
REGION=

Start SafeLine:
docker compose up -d

Without SafeLine:
User → Web Server


User → SafeLine (reverse proxy) → Web Server


Just like Nginx, it sits in front of your app and inspects every request.

# Reset admin password
docker exec safeline-mgt resetadmin

Access the console at:

https://<your-ip>:9443

Go to Applications → Add Application

Forward port 80 and 443 to your backend service

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schemas in PostgreSQL aren’t just for large systems—they’re for anyone who wants to keep their data structured. A schema is like a folder within your database where related objects (tables, views, etc.) are grouped together. This helps you separate concerns, organize logic, and secure your data more effectively. Here’s a practical look at how they work.
Organization: Separate business domains (like inventory and users).
Control: Limit access to different parts of your app.
Maintenance: Make backups and updates more targeted.
Cleaner Queries: Avoid clutter in your namespace.
Comes with every PostgreSQL database. If you don’t specify a schema, objects go here.
Created manually to isolate logic or control access.
CREATE SCHEMA hr;

How Data is Structured
PostgreSQL Cluster
  └── Database
      └── Schema
          └── Tables, Views, Functions, etc.


This layered model helps manage growing projects without chaos.
CREATE SCHEMA inventory;

CREATE TABLE inventory.products (
  product_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(255),
  price DECIMAL,
  stock_quantity INT
);

CREATE TABLE public.users (
  user_id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT,
  email TEXT
);

Using schemas lets you organize your app by responsibility—making it easier to evolve or scale parts of your system.
Yes, and it’s a common best practice.
Public is open by default; custom is restricted unless granted.
Not directly, but they help manage large systems more cleanly.
Yes, using tools like pg_dump or schema migration scripts.
PostgreSQL schemas give you better structure, access control, and scalability. They're an essential tool for organizing your data without complicating your architecture. For a more detailed guide, visit the schemas in PostgreSQL article.]]></summary>

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the new open standard for connecting AI assistants. Typically you run it as:
stdio (Standard Input/Output): Used when Client and Server run on the same machines. This is simple and effective for local integrations (e.g., accessing local files or running a local script).
HTTP via SSE (Server-Sent Events): The Client connects to the Server via HTTP. After an initial setup, the Server can push messages (events) to the Client over a persistent connection using the SSE standard.
Most MCPs at the moment run as stdio locally but this is not ideal if you have a shared service that you want to deploy on a server. In this arti…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D Bin Packing Algorithm for Warehouse Cartonization 
Overview
Recommended Libraries
1. 3DContainerPacking (EB-AFIT)
C# library using the EB-AFIT heuristic.
Supports fixed container sizes.
Rotates items in all axis permutations by default.
Fast and high utilization.
Modify to restrict orientation if needed.
Available via NuGet or GitHub.
2. Sharp3DBinPacking
C# port of krris/3d-bin-packing.
Supports multiple heuristics.
Rotates items by default.
Available via NuGet (Sharp3DBinPacking).
Can be integrated into .NET applications.
Handling Constraints
Modify the code to restrict rotation for specific items.
Alternatively, encode items with equal dimensions to eliminate rotation variation.
Steps to integrate into a warehouse management system (WMS):
Define available cartons.
Collect order items and constraints.
Call the packer with item and carton data.
Use output (packed coordinates) for box generation or instruction.
Calculate shipping cost using box count and dimensions.
Performance and Trade-offs
Fast execution times (milliseconds to seconds).
Near-optimal packing.
Lightweight memory usage.
Trade-offs include possible extra boxes due to heuristic nature.
Summary
3DContainerPacking and Sharp3DBinPacking are suitable for real-time cartonization in warehouse environments. They provide excellent speed and utility, and can be customized for orientation constraints and other packing rules.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has been hit with a flood of lawsuits after it recently disclosed its user data was breached, with users accusing the crypto exchange of mishandling the incident.
At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly.
In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent proposal that aims to change Bitcoin’s base unit to make it easier to understand as a payment tool has run into opposition, with critics saying Bitcoin’s satoshis are no more confusing than the dollar’s cents. 
Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Bitcoin notches record weekly close as it reaches back toward peak price
Bitcoin (BTC) notched its highest-ever weekly close at just below $106,500 on midnight UTC on Sunday, May 18, as the cryptocurrency is again nearing its all-time high.
Its last highest weekly close was in December when it reached $104,400. It later went on to reach an all-time high of $109,358 on Jan. 20, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin also posted its highest-ever close in a 24-hour period on May 18. However, this is not the larges…]]></summary>

According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a "money transmitting business" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023.
Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.

"You can't 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both."

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.

However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.

While Mizrachi didn’t share details about his discussions with Keiser and Herbert, the timing of the post came 11 days before the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, where Mizrachi is scheduled to speak.

The creation of a Bitcoin reserve in Panama City would follow a recently approved measure permitting the use of crypto for public payments, including taxes, fines and municipal fees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paraguayan law enforcement has deported three individuals and arrested another for attempting to steal crypto miners at a facility near the country’s Itaipu hydroelectric dam.
According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.
Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.
