Live weather forecasts are now not just pleasant to have, but a requirement in today's fast-paced life. Farm production and business travel, shipping and daily commuting all depend on weather information. The global weather forecasting systems market size was $2.8 billion in 2023 and is forecast to progress at a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period 2030, according to a report by Grand View Research.
weather apps are now the standard on any given smartphone. Since global warming has caused climate patterns to increasingly unpredictably change, consumers crave hyperlocal, accurate, and timely weather data. Among the numerous hundreds of apps on offer, there exists one name that towers above the rest.
Who’s Leading the Forecast Race?


IBM-owned Weather Channel is the USA's number one downloaded and most reliable weather app. It boasts millions of downloads and superb ratings, with top-of-the-line radars, real-time alerts, and weather maps. The app uses AI and IBM's Watson to provide personalized weather data—making it not just a source of information but a smart assistant too.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🤖 What is GenAI (Generative AI)?
Instead of just analyzing or classifying data, GenAI generates original outputs based on what it has learned.
✏️ Examples of GenAI:
DALL·E → Creates images from text prompts
GitHub Copilot → Suggests code automatically
In short, GenAI helps machines create like humans do.
🔍 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?
🛠️ How RAG works:
It generates an answer using that info
This makes the response more accurate and up-to-date.
🖥️ What is an MCP Server?
An MCP Server is a tool that helps manage, deploy, and control AI models.
Think of it like a traffic controller that:
Deploys different versions of models
Routes tasks to the right model
Scales the infrastructure
Monitors usage and performance
This is especially useful when running multiple AI models in production.
🧠 What is an LLM (Large Language Model)?
✏️ What LLMs can do:
Summarize documents
Write essays or code
Translate languages
⚡ Examples of LLMs:
Claude by Anthropic
LLaMA by Meta
LLMs are the engine behind most GenAI apps today.

Like most devs these days, I’ve been diving into AI. I took a great course called Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2025]—it was in Python and really helped me grasp the basics.
But recently, I came across a webinar that slightly flipped my perspective. It explored how you can build AI models in Java—and why that matters, especially for enterprise systems already running on Java.
That inspired me to write an article about it, the potential of Java in the AI world, some great open-source tools, and how it fits into the bigger picture, most of the credit due to the webinar content ofc but I added my perspective 
If you're curious, read it and let me know what you think. Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences using Java for AI

But with these AI helpers doing more and more stuff for us, often on their own, we've got a really important question to ask: How do we know they're actually good at what they do? Are they reliable? Do they even do what we want them to do?
This is where evaluation frameworks come in. Think of these as the rulebooks and scorecards we use to check how well our AI agents are performing. They're super necessary because, let's be honest, putting an AI agent out there without properly testing it is like sending a car onto the road without brakes – risky, right? Bad agents can cost money, mess up your reputation, and make people lose trust…]]></summary>

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

If you've been working with React for a bit, you’ve probably heard people throw around terms like HOC, Render Props, Container-Presenter, or even Compound Components.
Sounds fancy, right? But what do these actually mean—and more importantly—why should you care?
Let’s break down a few common React design patterns, no theory overload, just straight-up use cases and examples you’d see in your day-to-day code.
What it is:

Split components by logic (container) and UI (presentational).
Why:

Keeps things clean. Easy to test, reuse, and manage.
Example:
// Container
function UserContainer() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {

  }, []);

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in that the US Federal Reserve might cut rates sooner than expected.

The restaking narrative has moved fast — from side conversations in validator circles to the forefront of DeFi infrastructure discussions.
It’s not hard to see why. DefiLlama states that major liquid restaking protocols now hold over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), with dozens of middleware services aligning their security with Ethereum’s economic base layer. What started as an idea to increase capital efficiency for validators has evolved into a serious attempt to redefine how security is provisioned across decentralized systems.
While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s crypto-tied digital identity project World, formerly Worldcoin, has made its US debut in six cities. 
The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement.
World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. 
The firm had previously skirted launching in the US due to regulatory concerns over offering a token, fears now seemingly allayed with the crypto-friendly Trump administration.
The data from World’s Orb scan can be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform…]]></summary>

CertiK said in an April 30 X post that a total of $364 million was lost to exploits, hacks and scams in April, jumping from the $28.8 million recorded by CertiK in March. 
The firm added that white hat exploiters had returned around $18.2 million from exploits on the crypto protocols KiloEx, Loopscale and ZKsync, which brought down the month’s total.
The largest hack in April, and the fifth largest to date, involved an elderly US individual who lost 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million. The Bitcoin was stolen from their wallet after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access on A…]]></summary>

Alexei Zamyatin, the co-founder of the Bitcoin layer 2 Build on Bitcoin, told Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Dubai that “the advantage of Bitcoin DeFi is that the market is much bigger, you have a much bigger retail user base that you can tap into.”
“It’s not easy to convert it, but if you manage to win in Bitcoin DeFi, you win the entire market.”

The House passed the Digital Assets Investment Act, or House Bill 92, on its third reading on April 30 by a vote of 71 to 44.
Republican House Speaker Destin Hall introduced the bill in February, which would allow the treasurer to allocate 5% of the state’s investments into designated digital assets.

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. 
“Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. 
The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws.

Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The crypto industry has seen a significant shift toward regulatory compliance since its early days, according to James Smith, co-founder of Elliptic, a crypto compliance firm established in 2013.
“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph
That began to shift as regulators, including those in New York State, took a more active interest in the crypto industry. The involvement of traditional financial institutions like Fidelity and DBS Bank also contributed, as they entered the…]]></summary>

The former Binance executive joined a fireside panel with macroeconomic analyst Raoul Pal to discuss the rationale behind his 2022 investment in X and artificial intelligence. Zhao said:
“I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don't have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.”  
“So, when we invested in Twitter back then, it was based on that philosophy,” Zhao continued.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s crypto-tied digital identity project World, formerly Worldcoin, said on April 30 that it will make its US debut, first coming to the so-called “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco.
World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their humanity with its spherical device called an Orb that scans a user’s face and eyeballs, which can then be used to make a World ID on the company’s platform to verify they are human on connec…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>
