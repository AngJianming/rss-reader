Firms such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy have bought more Bitcoin (BTC) this year than any other category of investor, with overall corporate holdings growth totalling 157,000 BTC, worth around $16 billion at current prices, according to Bitcoin investment firm River. 
Strategy makes up 77% of the group's growth, the firm reported on X on May 12, before adding that it's not just big companies.
“We’re seeing businesses across all industries sign up to River. They’re aligned with Bitcoin and how it can change their future,” the firm noted.

Developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be costly, especially during the development phase. Each API call to services like OpenAI or Anthropic consumes tokens, and these costs can accumulate rapidly during iterative development and debugging.
I developed Copilot Proxy to address this issue. It's a local API proxy that routes your LLM requests to GitHub Copilot, maximizing your free quota usage and minimizing your API costs.
Some developers turn to local solutions like Ollama, which allows running open-source models such as LLaMA and Mistral locally. While this approach offers privacy and cost benefits, it comes with certain limitations:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Processing nonlinear constraints in MATLAB's fmincon function can sometimes lead to puzzling errors, particularly the message stating that the nonlinear constraint function is undefined at the initial point. This can be particularly confusing when the command window indicates that the function is indeed defined for the initial guess. In this article, we will explore the causes of this error and provide a step-by-step guide to resolving it.
Understanding the Issue
When using fmincon for optimization in MATLAB, the function evaluates constraints to determine whether the initial point provided (in this case x0) is feasible. The error message you've encountered, "Nonlinear constraint function is undefined at initial point," often arises due to one of the following reasons:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Untuk mengelola kuota harian yang bisa berkurang, bertambah, dan reset setiap hari, kamu bisa menggunakan gabungan fitur dari MySQL dan Laravel untuk hasil yang optimal dan fleksibel.
Berikut adalah pendekatan terbaik:
Misalnya kamu punya tabel kuota_harian:
CREATE TABLE kuota_harian (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    tanggal DATE NOT NULL,
    kuota INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    kuota_terpakai INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

Reset Otomatis Tiap Hari


Ada 2 pendekatan:
(Disarankan) Gunakan Laravel + Scheduler


Buat job/artisan command yang dijalankan setiap hari lewat Laravel Scheduler.
Langkah-langkah:
Tambahkan php artisan make:command ResetKuotaHarian

Di dalamnya, insert data baru untuk hari ini, atau reset kuota jika sudah ada.
Jalankan lewat scheduler (app/Console/Kernel.php):




protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('kuota:reset')->daily();
}

Bisa juga buat event MySQL:
CREATE EVENT reset_kuota_harian
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
STARTS CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL 1 DAY
DO
  INSERT INTO kuota_harian (tanggal, kuota, kuota_terpakai)
  VALUES (CURDATE(), 10, 0);

Namun, MySQL Events kurang fleksibel dan perlu aktifkan event_scheduler.
Mengurangi/Menambah Kuota


Gunakan query di Laravel saat user booking atau cancel:
// Kurangi kuota
DB::table('kuota_harian')
    ->where('tanggal', today())
    ->increment('kuota_terpakai');

// Tambah kuota (misal user batal)
DB::table('kuota_harian')
    ->where('tanggal', today())
    ->decrement('kuota_terpakai');

Atau validasi dulu:
$kuota = DB::table('kuota_harian')->where('tanggal', today())->first();
if ($kuota->kuota_terpakai < $kuota->kuota) {
    // lanjutkan booking
}




Fitur
Laravel
MySQL




Reset Harian
✅ Lebih fleksibel
❌ Kurang fleksibel


Modifikasi Kuota
✅ Sangat cocok
❌ Sulit dan kaku



Gunakan Laravel Scheduler untuk reset harian.
Gunakan query Laravel untuk manipulasi kuota.
Gunakan tabel kuota_harian per tanggal agar fleksibel.]]></summary>

If you've encountered an error when trying to use HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsoluteUri in your C# Windows Forms application, you're not alone. This line is typically associated with ASP.NET Web applications, which can lead to confusion when trying to use it in a non-web context, such as a desktop application. In this article, we'll explore why this issue occurs and how to solve the problem effectively.
Understanding the Issue
In desktop applications created with Windows Forms, HttpContext does not exist because these applications do not run within a web server context. This is mainly the reason why the line of code results in an exception error. The HttpContext.Current property brings context specific to an HTTP request, which is absent in a standalone application.

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hundreds of billions of dollars in cross-border cryptocurrency payments flow globally, driven primarily by speculative investment, according to a recent report by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
The BIS study, published May 8, found cross-border payments using the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and the two largest stablecoins, USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), totaled about $600 billion during the second quarter of 2024, the final observation period covered by the analysis.
“Our findings highlight speculative motives and global funding conditions as key drivers of native crypto asset flows,” the BIS said.

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.
On April 20, 2025, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a “radical” new sc…]]></summary>
