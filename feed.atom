For beginners, the easiest way to get started is by using Jira Cloud. Simply sign up on the Jira website, create a new project by choosing a suitable template like Scrum, Kanban, or bug tracking, and invite your team members. Jira’s interface is user-friendly, allowing you to set up boards with columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" to track work visually. It’s beneficial for task management, where you can break down work into smaller issues, assign them to team members, and set due dates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[O controle de fumaça em residências multifamiliares tornou-se uma preocupação fundamental para garantir a segurança, o bem-estar e a qualidade de vida dos moradores. Com o aumento da densidade populacional em edifícios residenciais, a prevenção da propagação de fumaça e gases tóxicos torna-se essencial para evitar acidentes e proteger vidas. Sistemas eficientes de controle de fumaça não apenas minimizam os riscos de incêndios, mas também asseguram uma evacuação segura, facilitando a identificação rápida de problemas e reduzindo danos materiais. Além disso, soluções modernas para controle de fumaça contribuem para a conformidade com normas regulamentadoras e elevam o padrão de segurança nas comunidades residenciais. A implementação de tecnologias específicas e estratégias integradas para o gerenciamento da fumaça reflete uma preocupação crescente com a segurança coletiva, promovendo ambientes mais seguros, confortáveis e preparados para eventuais emergências. 
Layout e Projetos de Sistemas de Controle de Fumaça 
Tecnologias Modernas e Automação no Controle de Fumaça 
Outro diferencial são as plataformas de monitoramento remoto, que permitem a gestão ágil por equipes de segurança ou manutenção, mesmo à distância. Essas tecnologias reduzem os falsos alarmes, otimiza o consumo de energia e aumenta a confiabilidade do sistema. Como exemplo, uma cabine de comando pode receber alertas em tempo real de diversos detectores espalhados pelo prédio, acionando automaticamente sistemas de ventilação e emitindo alarmes sonoros e visuais às equipes de segurança. Assim, a automação do controle de fumaça para residências multifamiliares oferece maior segurança, conforto e agilidade de resposta. 
Normas, Regulamentações e Conformidade Legal

Difficulty: #Medium
Tags: #Matrix #BFS #Graph #BruteForce
(in your own words)



Find the minimum number of moves to reach the last square of a Snakes and Ladders board, where each move can be from 1 to 6 squares forward. The board has snakes that send you back and ladders that take you forward.
Brute Force Idea:
This problem is actually a brute force problem, But in top of that we can use BFS to find the shortest path.


Optimized Strategy:
We can use a BFS approach to explore all possible moves from the current position. Each position on the board can be treated as a node in a graph, and the edges represent valid moves (1 to 6 squares forward). We also need to account for snakes and ladders by mapping them to their respective destinations.
We can use …]]></summary>
