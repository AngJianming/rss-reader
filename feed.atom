Sound familiar?
This scenario plays out countless times in the development world, and more often than not, the culprit is poor database indexing strategy. MongoDB indexes are simultaneously one of the most powerful performance tools and the biggest source of performance headaches for full stack developers.
In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into how MongoDB indexes actually work, explore real-world scenarios where they shine and where they backfire, and build a practical indexing strategy that scales with your application.

Once we are done understanding and memorizing the rules, I will start transferring the framework for doing System Design as explained by Juval Löwy in his book Righting Software.
As I’ve already stated: we are going to learn the rules, follow the rules, and once you are an expert — bend the rules.
Let’s keep track of what we’ve learned so far, to keep things at our fingertips even if you haven’t read the previous article:
A good system design speaks (how components interact)
Avoid functional decomposition (what we were doing in universities)
The client should not be the core business. Let the client be the client — not the system

This high-performance Rust HTTP framework fundamentally altered my view of web development. Here's a genuine account of my experience learning and using Hyperlane.
ctx Abstraction


When I first began using Hyperlane, I was immediately impressed by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. In other frameworks, I was accustomed to writing more verbose calls, such as:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

With Hyperlane, this simplifies to a single line:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

This design significantly boosts code readability, especially when handling complex business logic, by removing the need for deeply nested method calls.

When the application requires high performance, availability, scalability, and security
When greater control over and maintenance of the infrastructure is needed
When the application architecture involves complex microservices
