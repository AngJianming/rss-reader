The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. 
“I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said.
“I’ve always wanted to hear from my fellow commissioners about what makes sense to them, and there are many things that they’ve convinced me of…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📌 1. Global Variables


A global variable is declared outside of any function and can be accessed from anywhere in the code (inside or outside functions).
Example:





let globalVar = "I am global";

function showGlobal() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Can access globalVar
}

showGlobal();
console.log(globalVar); // Also accessible here

2. Local Variables


A local variable is declared inside a function (or block using let/const) and can only be accessed within that function or block.
Example:





function showLocal() {
  let localVar = "I am local";
  console.log(localVar); // OK
}

showLocal();
// console.log(localVar); // ❌ Error: localVar is not defined

Block Scope with let and const


Variables declared with let or const are block-scoped, which means they're only accessible within { } braces.
if (true) {
  let blockVar = "Inside block";
  console.log(blockVar); // OK
}
// console.log(blockVar); // ❌ Error

Note on var


var is function-scoped but not block-scoped.
function testVar() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
  }
  console.log(x); // ✅ Works: x is function-scoped
}
testVar();

In the increasingly competitive job market, drafting a resume and CV is not going to be enough to stand out among the others, as employers are seeking more than just the qualities mentioned in the paper. 
Regardless of your profession, a portfolio represents your professional story to the audience. It functions to block the barrier from the employers blocking you from job entry. Moreover, it demonstrates your problem-solving process, growth and learning journey. 
Today, I deployed my portfolio on kcng.netlify.app. Although this is just the first version, there are still enhancements and improvements that I plan to include in the future (SEO improvements, PWA, UI improvements...).
The community at dev.to has always been my favourite, which is why this is the first platform I wish to share my portfolio with. Your feedback would mean a lot to me! 🙏
I've always enjoyed building projects to show the world and this was really special for me. Thank you! 💜

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a task.
Syntax:





function functionName(parameters) {
  // code
  return result;
}

Example:





function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 3);  // result = 8
console.log(result);

2. Return Statement




return gives back a value from the function.
It exits the function immediately.




function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

console.log(greet("Sudhakar"));  // Hello, Sudhakar

3. Method – What is it?


A method is a function that belongs to an object.
Syntax:





let obj = {
  methodName: function() {
    return "I'm a method";
  }
};

Example:





let person = {
  firstName: "Sudhakar",
  greet: function() {
    return "Hello, " + this.firstName;
  }
};

console.log(person.greet());  // Hello, Sudhakar

Or write functional code with map, filter, reduce.




// OOP
class Car {
  start() {
    console.log("Engine on");
  }
}

// Functional
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = nums.map(n => n * 2);

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey’s financial services firm Block, Inc. will launch Bitcoin payments on Square, its payments processing arm, with a rollout to begin later this year before a full launch in 2026.
The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.
Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

“The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3,” Bitfinex analysts said in a May 28 markets note.
Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy”
Bitcoin (BTC) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22, however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.
According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. 
He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time…]]></summary>

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.”
In March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance.

The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

Bitcoin could turn parabolic if prices move above $115,000 to liquidate more than $7 billion in short positions.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit taking from BTC investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …]]></summary>
