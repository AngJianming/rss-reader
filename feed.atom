        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked so hard. 
Blood, sweat, and tears.
Nothing was enough. The market has changed. The market has decided to kick me out.
I'm overexaggerating, but this was an industry I fought since college to get into. 
I love software engineering. 
The joy of solving problems, digging into solutions with other people, and figuring out creative approaches to an algorithm during a brisk walk. These are what got me up in the morning to work, even though it never felt like work.
I'm starting to believe now that I merely got lucky in finding a software engineering job. I was hired during the COVID market, which was a great time for developers. 
I was getting callbacks, left and right, turning down opportunities, negotiating significant salary bumps.
Now here I am, sitting here discouraged from reading Reddit and LinkedIn about all the tech layoffs. Shortly after being let go, I read a message from a previous colleague on their alumni Slack channel about how he hasn't found a job in almost a year and could soon lose his house.
I'm not a very positive person, as you may tell. My previous posts have always been positive and lighthearted, encouraging people to never give up. I need to take my own advice.
It's harder now that I have a little girl to take care of.
I have enjoyed watching my daughter throughout the day, loved it in fact. But at the same time, I can't help but stress what the future holds for me in this career.
The best thing right now, keep going.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well… image-gen-1 is friggin expensive. At $3 per book, it’s just not sustainable for Story Hero long-term. So today was all about optimization mode. 🛠️💸
We dove deep into cost-cutting strategies for our image pipeline. Started comparing direct image-gen-1 calls with GPT-4o chat completions using tools to see how much we can stretch per dollar. At the same time, we started testing more specific and structured local workflows using ComfyUI to replicate high-quality results at a fraction of the cost. The testing continues… The nightmare continues. 😵‍💫

On a brighter note — we added an age gate to our onboarding flow to keep Story Hero safe for kids. 🧒👨‍👩‍👧
If a user is under 13, they’re now prompted to have a parent complete setup — a key step to ensure we’re COPPA-compliant and delivering on our promise to be the safest storytelling app for kids.


Every day gets a little tougher, but also a little more real. We’re still all-in on making Story Hero not just a product — but a mission.
Let’s keep shipping. 🦸‍♂️📚]]></summary>

It’s an app where users upload their data into categories. The app processes that data, runs some additional calculations and aggregations, and stores everything in a database. After that, users can view the resulting data in charts and grids on the website.
There’s also a requirement to capture that data and upload it as CSV files to an S3 bucket — daily, per account and per category.
There are around 20 categories and 10,000 accounts. So in total, the app needs to upload about 200,000 CSV files to S3 every day.
It all started with a simple cron job that ran a script every day at 5 AM.
The script did 3 things per account and category:
Loaded data from the MySQL database
Prepared the CSV file
Uploaded it to S3

That's why artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we work, collaborate, and make decisions today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2025, writing code is just the beginning. Testing, deploying, and automating workflows are part of a frontend developer’s daily toolkit — and GitHub Actions is leading that charge.
GitHub Actions is GitHub’s built-in CI/CD tool. It helps you:
Run tests automatically
Lint your code
Build static sites
Deploy to services like Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages
Automate workflow tasks via .yml config files
No extra tools. Just push code, and GitHub takes care of the rest.
With GitHub Actions, a push to main can trigger:
Lint checks
Tests
Deployments
Great for JAMstack sites or SPAs using Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase.
Want to make sure your React components or APIs don’t break?
- name: Run Jest
  run: npm test

Support for Jest, Playwright, Cypress, and more — built into your dev flow.
Stop broken code from making it into main. GitHub Actions helps with:
Pre-merge checks
TypeScript type-checks
ESLint issues
Broken links
name: Deploy Next.js App

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint & Test
        run: npm run lint && npm test
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

React, Vue, Angular, static HTML, Tailwind, Markdown sites — you name it.
Want to send a Slack message or deploy to Firebase? You can automate it.
With teams leaning more on automation and CI/CD, developers who understand GitHub Actions are:
More efficient
Easier to onboard
Preferred by modern dev teams
Official GitHub Actions Docs
GitHub Actions Marketplace
Starter Workflows
👉 Read: GitHub Actions for Frontend Devs in 2025
Are you using GitHub Actions already?
