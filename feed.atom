An unreliable SMTP service can lead to emails landing in spam folders, being delayed, or not arriving at all, damaging sender reputation and business outcomes.
This report provides a detailed review and analysis of three SMTP service providers: Yournotify, Brevo (formerly Sendinblue), and SendGrid. We will compare them based on reliability, deliverability, features, ease of use, pricing, and support to help you choose the best fit for your needs.

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets. 
Excerpt from Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report. Source: Tether
According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

The returned data can still be implicitly ordered by the primary key(if present) if the user does not apply their own ordering to the query. In Postgres and other SQL like databases, the way to order the result set from a query is by using the ORDER BY clause.
Sorting rows has an additional cost attached to it, which can lead to interesting choice of plans to execute a query. The planner generates multiple paths for query execution with each path representing a different way to get the results for the query. The path with the lowest cost is checked if it produces already sorted results, if not it would have to be sorted and the final costs re-compared against other paths. If it is already sorted, it w…]]></summary>

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

This post shares some tips and tricks I found while trying to speed up the development compile times for my app.
First things first: why does tauri dev take so long?
After some digging, I found the reason: Tauri uses the bundle.macos.minimumSystemVersion setting from your tauri.config.json as the value for the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable during its build process.

When you save changes in your editor, rust-analyzer often runs cargo check to look for errors. But, it usually runs without MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET being set.

Think of a REST API like a restaurant experience. You (the client) sit at a table and look at a menu (the API documentation). When you're ready to order, you call over a waiter (send a request) who takes your order to the kitchen (server). The kitchen prepares your food (processes the request), and the waiter returns it (the response).
In this analogy:
GET is like asking, "What's the special today?"
POST is like placing a new order
PUT is like saying, "Actually, can I change my side dish?"
DELETE is like canceling your order
That's REST in a nutshell - a set of conventions for requesting and modifying resources over HTTP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Collections are at the heart of Java development, shaping how we store, organize, and manipulate data every day. From Lists and Sets to Maps and Queues, Java Collections Framework offers a rich toolbox that can dramatically impact the efficiency and readability of your code.
But here’s the catch: with so many options, it’s easy to fall into the trap of using the same collection types repeatedly, even when a better alternative exists. Each collection has its strengths and ideal use cases-choosing the right one can boost performance, simplify your logic, and make your codebase more maintainable.
As backend engineers, we often focus on designing robust APIs, integrating microservices, and optimizing for scalability. However, the way we handle data in memory is just as critical. Understanding the nuances between ArrayList and LinkedList, or knowing when to use HashSet over TreeSet, can make a significant difference.
I’m curious:  
What’s your go-to Java collection, and why?

Have you ever faced a performance issue due to the wrong collection choice?

Any tips or lessons learned from your experience with collections in large-scale systems?
Let’s share insights and help each other write better, more efficient Java code! Drop your thoughts in the comments.

The decision was shared in a May 1 X post, with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avraham Eisenberg was sentenced to more than four years in prison on child sexual abuse material charges, unrelated to his role in the 2022 exploit that drained the decentralized exchange Mango Markets of roughly $100 million.
According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge. In May 2024, the judge suggested the sentencing for both cases would occur simultaneously in a consolidated proceeding. However, as of May 1, the fraud sentencing remains …]]></summary>

That equates to a Bitcoin gain of more than 61,000 Bitcoin (BTC), worth approximately $5.8 billion, according to the company. Bitcoin yield and Bitcoin gain are unofficial accounting metrics that Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buying strategy. 
Bitcoin yield measures the ratio of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to the number of outstanding shares of its stock, MSTR. Bitcoin gain quantifies that figure in terms of accrued Bitcoin, Strategy said in February.

In a May 1 letter to Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) — the entity responsible for managing the US government’s properties — Rep. Lance Gooden claimed that introducing crypto ATMs to federal buildings would serve as an “educational resource” and reflect advances in financial technology. He requested that the GSA begin exploring the necessary guidelines and regulations needed to install such ATMs in government-controlled properties across the US, citing alignment with President Donald Trump’s goals.

Bitcoin (BTC) is evolving into an alternative reserve currency, propelling institutional demand and potentially pricing out retail investors, Kunz said during Cointelegraph's LONGITUDE event in Dubai. 
"Every retail user should be thinking about getting at least one Bitcoin — very soon they won’t be able to afford it,” Kunz said. 
If the United States starts buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency, he added. "I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

The decision was shared in a May 1 X post, with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement:
"Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur."

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.

It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

“There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem development organization Wonderland wrote in a May 1 X post. Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules.
“The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.
