        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Legal tech is booming, but building for the legal industry comes with hidden technical, ethical, and compliance challenges..here’s what every dev should understand before jumping in.
So you want to build the next AI tool that revolutionizes law? Great!!legal professionals need better, faster tools. But before you start coding your first legal document parser or compliance bot, there are real-world landmines to avoid.
Legal data is often highly sensitive and subject to strict confidentiality rules (think attorney–client privilege or court-sealed documents). Scraping, storing, or even training on this kind of data without safeguards could expose you and your users to legal risk.
Also, when your AI outputs a compliance decision (e.g., GDPR audit findings or AML flags), you're not just providing a "suggestion", you may be influencing legal liability. Many jurisdictions require explainability, auditability, and even human-in-the-loop systems.
Legal language is dense, full of nuance, and jurisdiction-dependent. Two identical phrases may have opposite meanings depending on where and how they appear.
Of course, you know there are already APIs and frameworks built for legal applications. Don’t reinvent the wheel. 
Legal professionals are risk-averse by design. They value clarity, documentation, and accuracy over speed. Your app’s UX must reflect that. If they can’t trust it, they won’t use it, no matter how smart it is.
Are you building legal tech tools? What challenges have you run into? Drop a comment or connect—let’s push the future of legal AI forward, together.]]></summary>

What is a Load Balancer?
Imagine a highly skilled air traffic controller for your data. A load balancer acts as this crucial orchestrator, intelligently distributing incoming network requests across a cluster of servers. Its primary role is to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted service delivery. It's like having a smart dispatcher for your application's traffic, routing each request to the most available and capable server.
Why are Load Balancers Indispensable?
Optimized Performance: By evenly distributing workloads, they eliminate bottlenecks and ensure faster response times, leading to a superior user experience.

  Hi there! 👋


I'm Rozita, a frontend developer living in Austria. About a year ago, I moved here after working in tech for a few years, and today I want to share a little project that’s very close to my heart: MarkdownResume.app — a small open-source tool I built to help job seekers create clean, simple resumes.
As AI tools and large language models (LLMs) keep evolving, I've been thinking a lot about how technical documents — and especially resumes — need to adapt too.
I realized that so many resumes today look beautiful to human eyes, but behind the scenes, they’re a nightmare for applicant tracking systems. It made me wonder:

This article aims to guide you through how to better manage code snippets in VS Code, specifically for C# development, helping you work more efficiently.
Why Code Snippet Selection Issues Occur
When you type in VS Code, the editor matches snippets you might want to use, showing them in a suggestion list. The issue arises when your desired snippet isn’t the first suggestion.

HashSet<T> is one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in coding interviews. It allows constant-time lookup and guarantees unique elements only.



Use Case
Why Use HashSet




Check for duplicates
Fast Contains() check


Track seen items
O(1) add/lookup


Unique collections
Prevents duplicates automatically


Set operations (union/intersect)
Built-in set logic



var seen = new HashSet<int>();

seen.Add(5);        // true
seen.Add(5);        // false (duplicate)

bool exists = seen.Contains(5); // true
seen.Remove(5);     // removes 5

foreach (int num in seen)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
}

public bool ContainsDuplicate(int[] nums)
{
    var set = new HashSet<int>();
    foreach (int num in nums)
    {
        if (!set.Add(num)) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

public int LengthOfLongestSubstring(string s)
{
    var set = new HashSet<char>();
    int left = 0, maxLen = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < s.Length; right++)
    {
        while (set.Contains(s[right]))
        {
            set.Remove(s[left]);
            left++;
        }

        set.Add(s[right]);
        maxLen = Math.Max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLen;
}

var a = new HashSet<int>() { 1, 2, 3 };
var b = new HashSet<int>() { 2, 3, 4 };

a.IntersectWith(b);  // a = {2, 3}
a.UnionWith(b);      // a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.ExceptWith(b);     // a = {1}




Feature
Syntax Example




Declare
new HashSet<int>()


Add
set.Add(value)


Check Exists
set.Contains(value)


Remove
set.Remove(value)


Set Ops

UnionWith(), IntersectWith()

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧱 Arrays in C# — A Practical Guide for Interview Preparation


Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures used in programming and appear frequently in coding interviews.
An array is a fixed-size, indexed collection of elements of the same type.
// Declare and allocate memory
int[] numbers = new int[5];

// Declare and assign values
int[] scores = new int[] { 90, 85, 78, 92, 88 };

// Short-hand initialization
string[] names = { "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie" };

int first = scores[0];
scores[2] = 80;
int last = scores[scores.Length - 1];

// Using for loop
for (int i = 0; i < scores.Length; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(scores[i]);
}

// Using foreach loop
foreach (int score in scores) {
    Console.WriteLine(score);
}

Array.Sort(scores);         // Sort ascending
Array.Reverse(scores);      // Reverse array
int index = Array.IndexOf(scores, 92); // Find index of 92




Use Case
Description




Fixed-size data storage
e.g., Top 5 student scores


Indexed logic
Two pointers, prefix sum, etc.


Brute force comparisons
e.g., nested loops for pair matching



public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.Length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target)
                return new int[] { i, j };
        }
    }
    return new int[] { -1, -1 };
}




Feature
Syntax Example




Declare
int[] arr = new int[5];


Access

arr[0], arr[arr.Length - 1]



Update
arr[2] = 100;


Loop

for or foreach



Sort/Reverse

Array.Sort(arr), Array.Reverse()

Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said “lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. 
Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning.

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

“Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.
