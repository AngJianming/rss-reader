I remember the first time I installed PostgreSQL on my Mac, a mix of excitement and confusion. "Where do I even start? How do I create users? And how do I connect my app to it?"
If that sounds familiar, don't worry. In this guide, I'll walk you through how to start fresh with PostgreSQL on macOS using Homebrew, including how to launch the service, create a new database and user, and connect everything to your app — step by step, in a way that just makes sense.
Note: This guide focuses on macOS, but many of the PostgreSQL commands will work similarly on Linux. Windows users might want to look into PostgreSQL's official installer or WSL.
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database used…]]></summary>

Type casting in Java is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This can be done either automatically by the compiler (implicit casting) or manually by the programmer
There are two main types of casting: **
Widening Casting (Implicit): 
SYNTAX
Output:
Narrowing Casting (Explicit): 
SYNTAX:

Behind every spoofed identity is a threat actor—and they’re more diverse than you think. Before we turn into the six types of threat actors exploiting face authentication vulnerabilities, let’s first explore why knowing this categorization is essential for strengthening your security posture.
Prioritize Your Defenses: Not all threats are created equal. State-sponsored actors demand a different response than script kiddies or insider risks. Understanding who is most likely to target your system allows you to focus defenses where they matter most and avoid spreading resources too thin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript is an interpreted language, but modern engines use JIT compilation to optimize performance. In JavaScript, source code is not compiled to machine code ahead of time. Instead, it is first interpreted line-by-line, but as the code runs, the engine collects information and then compiles hot (frequently run) functions  to optimized machine code on the fly ("just in time"). JIT compilation is a hybrid approach between traditional interpreters and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation. Here’s how it works:
JIT Process (Simplified):




Parsing: JS code is parsed and converted to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).


Interpreter: The AST is run by a bytecode interpreter (e.g., Ignition in V8).


Profiling: The engine monitors which functions/loops are run often (“hot code”).

Hi there,
I am glad that the renewed Perl Ad Server seems to be taking off. If you have some Perl-related thing you'd like to promote to MetaCPAN and other sites displaying the ads, this is your chance to add it to inventory of ads.
If you have a Perl-related event that you'd like to be listed at the bottom of each edition of the Perl Weekly newsletter and included in the Perl events calendar, you can do that by sending a Pull-Request.
I'd also like to thank all the people who started to support me via GitHub sponsors. I feel happy that there are people out there who find my contribution valuable to award it with their financial support. I'd also like to thank the people who decided to support my by buying one of my books and courses. Thank you!

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.

When your users report "corrupted files" but everything looks fine on your end
Last month, I ran into one of those bugs that makes you question everything you think you know about web development. Users were complaining that downloaded files from our document management system were "corrupted" and wouldn't open. The twist? The files were perfectly fine in our AWS S3 bucket.
Picture this: You're building an application where users upload important kyc documents—driver's licenses, bank statements, tax documents. Everything seems to work perfectly during testing. Files upload fine, they're stored securely in S3, and when you download them through your admin panel, they open without issues.
Then the support tickets start rolling…]]></summary>

But back in March this year, I came across a tweet from a developer who discovered that one of those tools, Lovable, was exposing a user's Supabase API key. While it was a publishable API key, it had no permissions or restrictions, and the developer was able to access all the app's data without authentication, just by looking at the public build.
This is not innovation. This is a security breach waiting to happen.

This is what happens when people lean too hard on the vibe. They build software by instinct, skip fundamentals, and trust that the tool knows best. But when you are shipping products that handle real data, real users, and r…]]></summary>
