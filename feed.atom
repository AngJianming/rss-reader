Each technology is optimized for different data modeling approaches: PostgreSQL serves as a general-purpose relational database, while MongoDB functions as a general-purpose document database. While one is more data-centric and the other more application-centric, both can handle similar workloads. PostgreSQL offers flexibility over relational with its JSONB datatype, and MongoDB's flexible schema allows for some normalization through references and schema validation.
However, designing a document database as a relational one is inefficient, and vice versa. Although PostgreSQL can superficially resemble a document database with JSON datatypes, it is not optimized for using it …]]></summary>

Manual processes
Many businesses rely on manual tasks, especially during their early growth stages. But as data and customer numbers increase, routine work takes up more time. This can lead to employee overload and slower response times. Instead of progressing, companies often end up spending more time correcting mistakes.
Lack of real-time analytics

Even if you haven't read that article, if you are well versed in the need for users to authenticate and authorize to your specific service API and endpoints, then you get the gist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When a customer checks out on an e-commerce site and clicks “Pay,” a complex series of processes kicks off in milliseconds. This post breaks down what happens behind the scenes of a payment gateway, how it integrates into digital storefronts, and what makes the entire process secure and compliant.
A payment gateway acts as a bridge between the merchant’s website and the broader financial ecosystem — including issuing banks, acquiring banks, and payment networks. Its primary role is to:
Capture and encrypt payment information
Authenticate and authorize transactions
Communicate results back to the e-commerce platform
All of this occurs in real time, typically in under 2–3 seconds.
1. Checkout Begins
2. Tokenization
3. Authorization Request
4. Authentication (Optional / 3DS / OTP)
5. Response
6. Callback or Webhook
For a broader look at the payment methods modern e-commerce platforms support — from cards to UPI and wallets — you can check out this deep dive on how different e-commerce payment systems work.
Security is critical throughout. Here's how it's enforced:
PCI DSS Compliance: Merchants using hosted solutions are often considered SAQ-A level — the lowest risk level — since card data is never stored or handled directly.
SSL Encryption: All communication between browser, merchant server, and gateway is encrypted.
Tokenization: Replaces sensitive data with tokens, reducing data breach risks.
3D Secure / OTP: Adds an extra layer of authentication for card transactions.
HMAC-Signed Webhooks: Used to verify that callbacks are genuinely from the gateway.
Plug-and-Play vs Custom Integrations
Though often invisible to users, payment gateways form a vital layer in e-commerce architecture. Their ability to securely connect the merchant, customer, and financial institutions — in a matter of seconds — is what makes modern online commerce possible.]]></summary>

While infants begin to understand language from birth, their ability to express themselves verbally develops gradually over time. Baby sign language offers a proactive approach to enhancing communication during this critical stage by introducing simple gestures that infants can use to convey their needs and emotions. This innovative strategy not only facilitates earlier communication but also reduces frustration for infants who may struggle to articulate their desires through speech alone.

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.

Boston federal court Judge Richard Stearns sentenced Trung Nguyen, from Danvers, Massachusetts, to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, the Boston US Attorney’s Office said on May 22.

Republican state Representative Bill Schuette introduced House Bill 4510 on May 21, which would amend Michigan’s Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest in cryptocurrencies that have averaged a market cap above $250 million over the last calendar year.
Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.

        <updated>2025-05-22T18:41:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

The products will be offered through Backed, a new Kraken partner, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph. Tokens representing the stocks will be stored on the Solana blockchain due to its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem,” the statement said.
“The whole point of crypto is that we're able to see things very transparently,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said during Solana's Accelerate event on May 22. ”It's decentralized. It is open-source.

In a May 22 notice, Waters said the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act of 2025 bill would be aimed at blocking the US president, vice president, members of Congress and their families from engaging in “crypto crime.” 
The US lawmaker referred to Trump and his wife, Melania, issuing personal memecoins in January, his family launching a stablecoin, USD1, through the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, and the president attempting to establish a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve as his sons back a BTC mining venture.

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country. 
Semiconductor tariffs may compromise the goal of the CHIPS Act. The act promised tens of billions of dollars in subsid…]]></summary>

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. 
In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”
