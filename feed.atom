In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

In my previous article, I introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the USB-C of AI integrations - a standardized way to connect LLMs with external tools and data sources. Today, we're strapping on our digital spelunking gear and descending deeper into the mechanics of MCP.
Fair warning: we're about to get technical. But don't worry – even if you're not a hardcore developer, I've sprinkled in enough analogies and plain English explanations that you'll walk away with a much better understanding of how MCP actually works. So, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage and let's dive in!
Before we can understand MCP, we need to address a fundamental question: Can any LLM use MCP, or is there a prerequisite?
The simple answer is that MCP depe…]]></summary>

But here’s a better first step: instrument your endpoints and find out exactly where the delays are.
Which endpoints are consistently slow?
Which services take the longest to resolve?
Are response times spiking under certain conditions?
This kind of visibility is where NestJS Interceptors come in handy — and they’re seriously underrated.
Interceptors in NestJS let you hook into the request-response cycle.

You can run logic before or after a request is handled.
They’re perfect for:
Logging
Transforming responses

Measuring execution time
And the best part? You can do this without touching your business logic.

As an intern working on a real-world Import Export management system, I recently faced a challenge:
Every time I updated the backend code:
It wasn’t scalable. So I built a simple yet powerful CI/CD system with Telegram alerts.
Here’s what the pipeline does:
GitHub Webhook triggers on push
Server pulls the latest code
Runs build + restart commands
Sends a Telegram message with the result: success or failure
Node.js backend
Simple. Instant feedback without needing to check logs or dashboards.
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/udhyog/ImportExport/management-sheet
git pull origin main

if pm2 restart backend; then
  curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage" \
  -d chat_id=<your_chat_id> \
  -d text="✅ Deployment succeeded!"
else
  curl -s -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/sendMessage" \

Then came USB-C, and angels sang. One cable to rule them all.
Now imagine that same standardization revolution, but for AI models and the external tools they need to access. That, is exactly what Model Context Protocol (MCP) brings to the table.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

If you are working with JavaScript and AJAX, you may encounter scenarios where you need the result of an asynchronous operation before proceeding with subsequent logic. In the context of form validation, this can lead to pitfalls, especially when interactions with a database are involved.

Let's dive deep into how you can effectively manage asynchronous behavior in your validation function.

This error typically occurs because Laravel is trying to decrypt data that was encrypted with a different application key (APP_KEY). To solve this, I wrote a custom Artisan command that resets all encrypted setting values to an empty string.

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Bitcoin has historically delivered far more substantial gains than gold when their markets rally concurrently.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:
“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump gave clashing answers to whether he has profited from the crypto memecoin he launched in January, just days before he re-entered the White House.
In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News’ Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he’s profiting from the presidency through the memecoin.
“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.
“I haven’t even looked,” Trump admitted.
“But I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”
Trump launched his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he wa…]]></summary>

OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said in a May 4 statement to X that the DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, will resume with several new features, including a “real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.”
A DEX aggregator is a service that pulls data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers and then presents it to users to assist with trading. Xu says, “OKX Web3 is a browser and search engine for blockchain.”

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.
Like Andresen’s old website, Shrem’s page explains what Bitcoin is and how to receive Bitcoin.

The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days. 
Coinbase managing director for APAC John O’Loghlen said on May 5 the reelected Albanese Government has the “opportunity and the responsibility to move quickly on this issue” and called for a Crypto-Asset Taskforce to be established within its first 100 days “with the aim of bri…]]></summary>

The US-based Bitcoin (BTC) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.
This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day.  
The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery.
