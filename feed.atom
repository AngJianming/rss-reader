We often treat these powerful tools like casual chat partners. The secret to unlocking high-quality, relevant results is to change your mindset. 🔑 You’re not chatting with an AI; you're hiring it for a specific job. And every good hire needs a great job description. 🤝

I’ll talk about Java concepts, share my experiences, and give some tips along the way. I hope this blog helps others who are also learning Java. Feel free to follow along and share thoughts!
Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s widely used in enterprise environments. Learning Java can be very useful if you’re aiming to get a job at a big company. And of course, it is the best programming language in the world. If you disagree, I don’t care — it’s a fact. 👾
Let’s be honest. Java documentation is not the best. Trying to find something there can be hard, especially when you’re just starting your Java journey. If you’re not familiar with the world of programming, I recommend taking a course to get started with programming logic. One great option is “Introduction to Programming and Computer Science—Full Course” by freeCodeCamp.org.

After that, you should follow the Java Developer Roadmap. Link to the page below 👇
Java Roadmap
I've already started that roadmap, but I actually know more Java than it covers at this point.
In the next posts, I’ll explore all the concepts from that roadmap. If that sounds interesting, feel free to follow along on my profile. Good luck with your learning journey! ☕]]></summary>

Now, here’s my setup: I’m running a Django app on a CentOS 9 EC2 Server. For my web server, I chose Nginx for three key reasons: performance, load balancing, and ease of configuration, along with my familiarity with it. I also used Gunicorn as the proxy server to manage the Django services.

The problem:
While testing, I noticed something odd — a 3x speed difference between running the Django development server with Nginx routing traffic to it versus running it through Gunicorn.

Firstly in Perl it's important to understand that references are scalar values. This means that you can create a reference to a reference, and a reference to a reference to a reference, and so on. This is called a "deep reference" in programming.
To declare a reference to any scalar, you use the backslash operator ('\'). For example:
my $scalar = 42;
my $scalar_ref = \$scalar;

To dereference a scalar reference, you use the dereferencing operator ('$'). For example:
my $value = $$scalar_ref;  # This will give you the value 42

It’s rare to find such a solid structure, packed with real projects, completely open and maintained by volunteers.
Two core ideas make The Odin Project (TOP) stand out to me:
Learning how to learn and staying motivated over the long journey;
Focusing on principles over tools;
