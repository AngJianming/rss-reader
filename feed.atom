Being Student Preparing for highly competitive technical internships at top tech companies like Adobe, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others can be overwhelming. Aspiring candidates often struggle to understand the exact skill requirements, the nuances of the interview process, and how to build a structured, personalized study plan. This leads to wasted effort on irrelevant topics, missed application windows, and high stress levels.
To solve this, I built the Big Tech Intern Prep Agent, an autonomous AI workflow powered by Runner H. Starting from a single, detailed prompt, this agent researches a specific internship role at a leading tech company (e.g., Adobe Software Engineer Intern), analyzes the job requirements, studi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scalability is always a big consideration when building applications and while PHP often gets underestimated in this area, it’s still powering huge systems worldwide.
How do you approach scalability in your PHP projects?
Here are a few discussion prompts:
🏗 Architecture – Do you prefer microservices, modular monoliths, or something else when scaling PHP?
🧰 Frameworks/Tools – What PHP frameworks or tools have helped you scale (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, RoadRunner)?
💽 Databases & Caching – What strategies do you use to prevent bottlenecks (e.g., Redis, read replicas, horizontal scaling)?
🧪 Testing & Deployment – How do you maintain test coverage and deploy large PHP apps safely?
🔍 Lessons Learned – Any real-world challenges or “a-ha!” moments while scaling a PHP system?
Let’s swap tips, war stories, and best practices — whether you're running a startup or managing a massive legacy codebase.

As a computer science student nearing my senior year, I've been fascinated by the progression of software architecture. From monolithic designs to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and now to the widely adopted microservices model, each evolution has sought to overcome contemporary challenges, advancing software engineering towards improved efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. In my academic and practical endeavors, microservices—with their benefits like independent deployment, technological variety, and elastic scalability—have made a strong impression on me. Yet, microservices are not a panacea; they introduce new complexities along with their advantages.
