In this blog , I will take you through the process of setting up VPC, launching an EC2 instance within our VPC and will assign Elastic IP to ensure public internet access. So in future you can deploy your application on AWS .
Step 1: Creating a VPC
Go to the VPC dashboard Click on ‚ÄúCreate VPC‚Äù: Select the ‚ÄúCreate VPC‚Äù option to start the configuration.

Choose your desired CIDR block , i chose 10.0.0.0/16

Click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button once your configuration is complete.
Step 2: Create a Subnet
Select all the details carefully as mentioned below

Step 3: Creating an Internet Gateway
Go to the Internet Gateways Section: In the VPC Dashboard, navigate to ‚ÄúInternet Gateways.‚Äù

Attach the IGW to the VPC: After the IGW is created, select it and click on ‚ÄúAttach to VPC.‚Äù


Step 4: Edit the Route Table
Go to the Route Tables Section: In the VPC Dashboard, navigate to ‚ÄúRoute Tables.‚Äù

Select your route table for our VPC and add a route .

Step 5: Launch an EC2 Instance and make sure you are launching within your VPC which you created





Finally click on ‚Äúlaunch Instance‚Äù
Step 6: Allocating and Associating an Elastic IP
Allocate elastic ip first select from the list and associate it to your instance.

Associate to instance.

Step 7: Test the EC2 instance with ping command to make sure instance can be reachable through internet.
Ping <your elastic ip>
By following these steps, you now understand how to configure networking in AWS and make your resources publicly accessible

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

        <updated>2025-05-17T16:22:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR:
Most Node.js encryption modules rely heavily on built-in crypto or JavaScript-based wrappers. I was looking for something more powerful ‚Äî something that could:
Handle real-world file encryption (not just in-memory strings)
Use native cryptography (OpenSSL) for performance
Include strong key derivation and tamper protection
Avoid JS performance bottlenecks
Enter hcef.
Here‚Äôs what stood out to me during testing:
AES-256-CBC encryption using OpenSSL ‚Äî same standard trusted in secure industries
PBKDF2 (100k rounds) + Argon2 ‚Äî dual key derivation makes brute-force attacks nearly impossible
HMAC-SHA256 ‚Äî verifies data integrity, catches even a single-bit tamper
Obfuscation layer ‚Äî Caesar cipher, XOR, byte reversal; adds an extra layer of complexity
Base64 + zlib compression ‚Äî makes encrypted files transferable and lightweight
Memory Cleansing ‚Äî sensitive data wiped with OPENSSL_cleanse()
C++ N-API Integration ‚Äî meaning it's fast, portable, and secure on all platforms
I tested it in multiple scenarios:
Encrypted and decrypted large text and binary files
Tampered with files to confirm HMAC detection
Simulated brute-force attacks with weak passwords
Ran performance benchmarks vs. pure JS encryption
Everything worked perfectly, and the speed difference was significant.
If you're looking for a native Node.js file encryption solution that‚Äôs more than just a JS wrapper ‚Äî hcef delivers. It's secure, fast, and doesn't get in your way. I‚Äôd love to see this gain more adoption in the community.
Shoutout to the developers behind this ‚Äî great work!

That‚Äôs when the Prototype Design Pattern came to the rescue.
This devblog is my simple, no-jargon guide to the Prototype Pattern‚Äîthe way I wish I had learned it.
üìñ What is the Prototype Pattern?
Prototype Pattern lets you create new objects by cloning existing ones‚Äîinstead of creating them from scratch.
In simple terms: You don‚Äôt build it, you copy it.
üîç Spotting a Prototype Pattern
Your object creation is expensive or complex

You want to avoid reinitializing an object

You have a method like clone() or copy()

You hear developers mumble things like ‚Äúdeep copy‚Äù or ‚Äúshallow copy‚Äù

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[During my PhD, I developed and published an algorithm ‚Äî together with my advisor and a colleague ‚Äî to enhance photos of documents captured with digital cameras. These images often suffered from uneven lighting across the page. Our algorithm corrects this by normalizing the illumination, similar to what CamScanner does. The implementation is written in C++ and is available on my GitHub: https://github.com/dmo2000/shading-removal-illustrated-docs.
The method works in four steps:
Detection of low-variation regions: The algorithm first identifies areas in the image with low color variation, which are likely to correspond to blank regions of the paper (i.e., without text or illustrations).


Background clustering: From these low-variation regions, it extracts the cluster most likely to represent the paper's true background.


Shading estimation: Once the paper background is identified, the algorithm estimates the shading pattern for the rest of the document, including non-blank areas.
To perform this step, I used a technique known as Natural Neighbor Interpolation (also called Voronoi interpolation). This method is especially useful when data points (in this case, known shading values) are unevenly distributed ‚Äî a situation similar to how weather data is interpolated from scattered measurement stations.
For the interpolation and related geometric computations, I used the CGAL library. I also relied on data structures from the Boost C++ libraries to support the implementation.
Final enhancement: Finally, the image is enhanced removing the shading obtained in previous step.



The images below shows one example of processing:
Original Image

Cluster with detected background (steps 1 and 2)

Background estimation (step 3)

Final enhancement (step 4)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin‚Äôs current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.¬†

Bitfinex margin longs fell 18%, despite Bitcoin price rising 24% in 30 days.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which ‚Äúhistorically is a bullish sign for prices.‚Äù

Speaking to Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Carbone argued it is in the best interests of the US to pass comprehensive stablecoin regulations to protect US dollar hegemony in global markets, which has bipartisan appeal and support. Carbone said:
"These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it's stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it's a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote."

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts.¬†
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks ‚Äî Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äù and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.¬†

In this week‚Äôs episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or ‚Äúgrandfathering‚Äù period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app‚Ä¶]]></summary>
