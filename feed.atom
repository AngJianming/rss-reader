        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance can be confusing, especially when dealing with __proto__, [[Prototype]], and .prototype. While these terms may seem similar, they serve distinct roles in how objects inherit properties and methods.
At the core of JavaScript’s inheritance system is the [[Prototype]] internal slot, which determines an object’s prototype. The __proto__ property provides a way to access or modify this prototype, though it’s now considered outdated. Meanwhile, .prototype exists only on constructor functions and is used to define methods and properties that instances should inherit.
Understanding the difference between these three is crucial for writing efficient, maintainable code. In this article, we’ll break down their roles, how they interact, and best …]]></summary>

On day 9, I will show how Vue 3, SvelteKit, and Angular perform dynamic CSS Class and Style binding. There is an example of CSS Class binding and Style binding. When an item is purchased, strikeout class is applied. When an item is considered high priority, priority class is used.  When the high priority checkbox is checked in the Add Item Form, the text is bolded by the font-weight style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Record Utility Type in TypeScript


TypeScript provides a rich set of utility types to help developers write cleaner and more robust code. One of the most useful and versatile is the Record type. In this article, I'll explore what Record is, when to use it, and how to use it effectively with real-world examples.
Record?


The Record type is TypeScript utility type that lets you define an object type with a specific set of keys and a consistent value type for all keys.
Syntax
Record<Keys, ValueType>

Keys: The union of keys you want the object to have (must be a type that extends string | number | symbol).
ValueType: The type of the values associated with those keys.
Example
type UserRole = 'admin' | 'user' | 'guest';

const rolePermissions: Record<UserRole, string[]> = {
  admin: ['read', 'write', 'delete'],
  user: ['read', 'write'],
  guest: ['read']
};

enum Status {
  New = 'new',
  InProgress = 'in_progress',
  Done = 'done'
}

const statusLabels: Record<Status, string> = {
  [Status.New]: 'New Task',
  [Status.InProgress]: 'Task In Progress',
  [Status.Done]: 'Completed Task'
};

type CountryCode = 'US' | 'JP' | 'FR';

const countryNames: Record<CountryCode, string> = {
  US: 'United States',
  JP: 'Japan',
  FR: 'France'
};

type Lang = 'en' | 'ja';
type Page = 'home' | 'about';

const translations: Record<Lang, Record<Page, string>> = {
  en: {
    home: 'Home',
    about: 'About Us'
  },
  ja: {
    home: 'ホーム',
    about: '私たちについて'
  }
};

type Product = {
  name: string;
  price: number;
};

type ProductID = 'p1' | 'p2';

const productCatalog: Record<ProductID, Product> = {
  p1: { name: 'Keyboard', price: 99 },
  p2: { name: 'Mouse', price: 49 }
};

type Features = 'darkMode' | 'betaAccess';
const featureFlags: Partial<Record<Features, boolean>> = {
  darkMode: true
};]]></summary>

Battle Tanks Arena is a two-player tank combat game built with Python and Pygame. Players control different types of tanks in a destructible environment, using various weapons to defeat their opponent.
Multiple Tank Types: Choose between standard, heavy, and scout tanks, each with unique stats
Diverse Weapons: Use standard shots, missiles, lasers, and mines
Destructible Environment: Strategic cover that changes as the battle progresses
Power-ups: Collect health and weapon upgrades during gameplay
Player 1: WASD to move, SPACE to shoot, 1-4 to switch weapons
Player 2: Arrow keys to move, ENTER to shoot, Numpad 1-4 to switch weapons
I created this game using Python and the Pygame library. The biggest challenges were implementing the collision detection system and creating the destructible environment mechanics.
The game is available on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/Fahad035/Arcade-games/blob/main/battle_tanks_arena.py]]></summary>

You are given a list of integers and an integer k. You must split the list into exactly k non-empty consecutive parts. The “score” of a partition is calculated by taking each part, summing its numbers, then squaring that sum, and finally adding up all these squared values. Your goal is to find the maximum possible score over all ways to split the list into k consecutive parts.
On the first line: two integers, n (the length of the list) and k (the number of parts), with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200 000.
On the second line: n integers (each between –10000 and 10000), representing the list.
A single integer: the highest score you can achieve by splitting the list into exactly k consecutive non-empty parts.

So how do modern online doc translators tackle this challenge?
Let’s dive into how context-aware AI models, particularly transformers, are reshaping the quality and reliability of document translations—especially for longer, domain-specific files like legal contracts, academic papers, or medical reports.
Basic translation tools often struggle with:

Create the longest possible palindrome by selecting some elements from words and concatenating them in any order. Each element can be selected at most once.
Return the length of the longest palindrome that you can create. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return 0.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
Example 1:
Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.
