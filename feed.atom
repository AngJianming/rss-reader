Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm back again with another update from the world of Gland ‚Äî and this one is kinda big for me.
So far, I‚Äôve talked a lot about Gland being protocol-agnostic. But recently, something shifted. Gland is not just protocol-agnostic anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs kinda framework-agnostic too.
What does that even mean?
Let‚Äôs be real: right now Gland doesn‚Äôt care whether you're using Express, Fastify, Hono, or literally anything else that can act like an HTTP server. You can swap them in and out with minimal effort. And I‚Äôm not talking about some theoretical plug-and-play thing. I mean actual working code.
Take this simple example:
glandjs/gland/main/samples/01-simple/src/main.ts
In this setup, I‚Äôm using Express. But if you want Fastify instead? Just do this:

XCFrameworks are a modern approach to distribute binaries across platforms with compatibility for different architectures like iOS, macOS, and tvOS.

DJ Electrohead is an AI- powered interactive DJ simulation game that combines music mixing with crowd interaction. The game features three distinct play modes:


Crowdplay Mode: Connect with Spotify to mix real tracks. An AI-powered crowd reacts to your song choices, analyzing how well you maintain energy and flow between tracks.

Strudel Mode: Create live beats with code using the strudel repl's musical loops and patterns. The crowd responds to your rhythm and creativity in real-time.

Mixing Mode: Create live mixes of two songs alongside the multitude of tools you would find on a real DJ's turntable!

Key features:
Dynamic crowd reactions with a real-time vibe meter powered by deepseek-VL v3
Score system with combo multipliers for maintaining crowd energy
Animated DJ character sprites that responds to the crowd's mood depending on a dynamic crowd vibe meter
High score tracking across both game modes
Seamless Spotify integration for authentic DJ experience and the ability to play any song you want!
Strudel allows users to flex their coding ability whilst creating banger music
Users can actually DJ using turntables along with snares, kicks, pitch changes, reverbs and flangers!

Repository Link
I first thought about what I wanted to build and then asked chatgpt to create a text document titled: "Tasks.txt" (available in the github repository) 


Then I instructed Amazon Q developer to use the file tasks.txt as a starting point to get a feel for what it has to build. 


Since the task sheet is split into different phases, I made Q developer stop everytime it completed a major task in each phase and tweaked the code manually or using q dev itself if needed.


After reviewing every phase's features that q developer implemented, I pushed it to my repository and moved on to the next phase.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800‚Äì$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum‚Äôs native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum‚Äôs potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum‚Äôs native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether‚Äôs potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don‚Äôt. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they‚Äôre quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance‚Äôs (DeFi) future.

Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step.

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo‚Äôs recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, ‚ÄúWe see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.‚Äù

Launched with the slogan ‚ÄúIt goes where you go,‚Äù the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
‚ÄúThe thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,‚Äù Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
‚ÄúWhen something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,‚Äù she added.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as ‚Äúcritical‚Äù and noted the attacker‚Äôs use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker‚Äôs wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token‚Äôs team has not yet released an official statement.

Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

The move marks RedotPay‚Äôs latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as ‚Äúprice fixing,‚Äù equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom ‚Äî a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki‚Äôs long-held concerns.

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted.¬†

President Trump‚Äôs reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH‚Äôs renewed outlook.¬†

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.
