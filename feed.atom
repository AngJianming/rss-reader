What are the differences between API and SDK?” I thought it would also be nice to have a simple-to-understand explanation for you guys.
Let’s start with the API. To put it simply, API is how software talks to each other.
If this is too vague, consider it a clearly defined way one program can request services or information from another. Instead of a human clicking a button, one piece of software makes a structured call to another.
Many larger software platforms are providing API services to interact with their software. Let’s tak…]]></summary>

The hyperlane framework natively supports the WebSocket protocol. Developers can handle WebSocket requests through a unified interface without dealing with protocol upgrades manually. This article demonstrates how to implement both point-to-point and broadcast messaging on the server side using hyperlane, along with a simple WebSocket client example.
The hyperlane framework supports the WebSocket protocol with automatic server-side protocol upgrading. It also offers features such as request middleware, routing, and response middleware.
Note: WebSocket responses must be sent using the send_response_body method. Using send_response will cause client-side parsing to fail, as it does not format the response according to the WebSocket protocol.

Reactjs Core
Nextjs Core
In React, routing is manual you have to set it up with tools like react-router. In Next.js you just create a folder in the app directory and name it based on your route name (ex: about,dashboard), No boilerplate code needed.
For SEO and performance, Next.js uses SSR and static generation. It can pre-render HTML on the server, which loads faster and is more SEO-friendly. Dynamic pages can also be server-rendered in chunks — Next figures out what to serve based on the user's request and only sends what's needed. If a page uses use client, the server sends that component's JavaScript to the browser, which then renders it client-side.

Oracle's docs are comprehensive but not always practical. Community forums solve specific problems but don't show the bigger picture. I wanted something in between - structured tutorials that assume you know Oracle APEX basics but need guidance on doing things the right way.

  👋 Introduction


Hi there!

Last week, I built my first fully functional website, implementing AI to predict diabetes risk using historical data. This was my first time publishing a real, working website—and I am honestly proud of the result. And I built all this during 48-hour hackathon, working solo.

I used Streamlit for the UI, scikit-learn for the AI training, and a model. Here is how:
When the project topic was first released, I was slightly surprised to see healthcare 💓 — most of the hackathons I had joined previously allowed more open-ended, general tech solutions. But then I started thinking 🤔, and this pushed me to research more deeply.

Since I was good at data analysis and developing ML models, I decided to focus on those are…]]></summary>

A display designed for a handheld device is fundamentally different from one engineered for 24/7 operation in a high-temperature, high-vibration environment.
In this post, we’ll explore the core differences between industrial and consumer-grade TFT displays, and why choosing the wrong type can lead to premature failure, performance issues, or even safety risks in demanding applications.
An industrial TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display is built to operate in harsh, mission-critical environments—think factory automation, medical equipment, agricultural systems, and outdoor kiosks. These displays prioritize long-term reliability, therm…]]></summary>

Let's say you have an e-commerce app, and you want to allow users to add products





  
  
  Enabling Anonymous Authentication in Supabase




Create a new Project in Supabase.com
You might need to create a new organization if you don't have one.
Then give your project name and db password
Once the project is created, you will have the project URL and anon key. You can use these to connect to your project.
Note that these are public keys, and you can share them. Like Firebase, you protect your data with rules.
Go to the Authentication section in Supabase



Then go to the sign section
