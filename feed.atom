This project serves as a platform for sharing my knowledge, continually learning best practices, and simultaneously contributing to the community.
Demo: https://pdfun.xyz
GitHub - dalenguyen/pdfun
The solution is built around GCP ecosystem, it’s better to deploy the project on GCP, so it can access their services. There are two parts of the solution:
Web UI (Analogjs - Angular): handle user interaction
Backend (Node - Express): process PDF files

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past year, I’ve applied to dozens of research internships in AI and Machine Learning—both in India and internationally. It’s been a journey full of rejections, growth, and unexpected breakthroughs. Here’s what I learned:
💡 Foreign research internships are extremely competitive.
🔍 International labs are highly specialized and advanced.
🇮🇳 Indian labs are more accessible—and equally valuable.
📬 Cold emailing is a skill, not just a strategy.
Personalize every message. Mention their work. Be clear on why you're reaching out.
🎯 The biggest lesson: Don’t chase prestige—chase learning.
If you're an undergrad trying to break into AI/ML research, I’ve been there—and I’m happy to help. Feel free to reach out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a tech leader means juggling flaming hats while dodging meetings and shielding your devs from corporate nonsense. Let's talk about it.
(a.k.a. Making up the plan as you go)
You’re expected to “steer the ship” with a smile and a vaguely confident roadmap you assembled 20 minutes before your standup. Fake it. Then figure it out. That's the job.
(a.k.a. fluent in C-suite buzzword and junior dev anxiety)
One hour you're decoding “synergize agile growth,” the next you're explaining to your devs why you're not switching the whole stack to Rust. Again.
You protect your team from scope creep, chaos, and every “quick fix” idea that lands in Slack at 4:57pm. It's not glamorous, but it's necessary.
Spoiler: Culture isn't ping pong tables and pizza Fridays. It's trust. It's listening. It's making space for real humans with real thoughts. Radical, right?
You’re not here to be a boss. You’re here to lead.

That means throwing out the old leadership playbook and building something better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent breakthrough, researchers have adapted large language models to understand the human genome in much the same way they interpret text. By training on billions of letters of DNA, these models learn the patterns, grammar, and context of genetic sequences, unlocking new ways to predict how genes behave and how mutations might lead to disease.
The model, named GeneLM, was developed by a team of computational biologists who recognized that DNA, like language, is a sequence governed by rules and structure. By applying techniques originally designed for understanding human language, they were able to predict gene expression levels, regulatory elements, and even the effects of non coding variants that were previously difficult to interpret.
What makes this development powerful is the model’s ability to generalize. It can identify the function of genetic elements in regions that have never been studied, offering insights into rare diseases and complex traits. Unlike traditional methods, which often require specific biological annotations, this approach works directly from sequence data.
Early tests show that GeneLM outperforms existing models in predicting gene activity and identifying potential disease related regions in the genome. Researchers believe it could become a foundational tool in genomics, much like language models have become in artificial intelligence.
This line of research is still evolving, but it marks a shift in how we read and understand the human genome. By treating DNA as a language, scientists are beginning to unlock its meaning with unprecedented depth and speed.

Through my experience working with production-level React Native apps, I’ve seen how small changes in how you write and structure code can significantly impact performance. Here are some battle-tested strategies worth keeping in mind:
🔹 Keep Your Lists Lean
🔹 Avoid Unnecessary Renders
🔹 Optimize Asset Usage
🔹 Reduce JS Bundle Load
🔹 Keep the UI Thread Free
These are just a few techniques I apply regularly to keep apps smooth, fast, and efficient. Every app is different, so profiling and testing should be part of your optimization process.
🚧 Performance isn’t a one-time fix — it’s an ongoing mindset. Monitor, tweak, and keep iterating.
