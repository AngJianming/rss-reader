        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone's freaking out about AI taking jobs. Truckers are doomed. Radiologists are toast. Accountants better start learning to code, right? Wrong. Here's a hot take that'll probably piss off the AI evangelists: software developers could end up being the last profession standing, not the first casualty.
I know, I know. Sounds like developer arrogance. But hear me out.
Here's something nobody talks about: every AI tool threatening to replace programmers was built by... programmers. ChatGPT? Built by software engineers. GitHub Copilot? Yep, developers. That fancy new AI that supposedly writes perfect code? Also built by humans who write code for a living.
It's like asking carpenters to build the robot that will replace all carpenters. Except the robot keeps breaking, needs constant updates, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Damned Lies is the name of GNOME’s web application for managing localization (l10n) across its projects. But why is it named like this?

On the About page of GNOME’s localization site, the only explanation given for the name Damned Lies is a link to a Wikipedia article called "Lies, damned lies, and statistics".
"Damned Lies" comes from the saying "Lies, damned lies, and statistics" which is a 19th-century phrase used to describe the persuasive power of statistics to bolster weak arguments, As described on Wikipedia. One of its earliest known uses appeared in an 1891 letter to the National Observer, which categorized lies into three types:

Not a beginner, but not where you want to be either. You're writing decent code, fixing bugs, maybe even mentoring juniors—but that imposter voice still creeps in, whispering,

"You’re not good enough yet."
Here’s something every developer needs to hear:

You’re a lot closer than you think.
That feeling of "not there yet" is universal. We see polished portfolios, open source rockstars, AI-powered builds, and it’s easy to believe we’re falling behind.
But remember:
Most developers don’t tweet their late-night debugging sessions.


Nobody posts about the 12 times they rewrote the same function.


Everyone you look up to once Googled "how to center a div."



Success in tech isn’t a straight path—it’s built in layers. What you’re struggling with now? That’s just one layer. Stick with it long enough, and you’ll look back realizing how far you’ve come without even noticing.
Every bug fixed, every question asked, every time you said “I don’t know” and kept going—that's growth. And that’s what makes a real developer: not someone who knows it all, but someone who refuses to give up when they don’t.
What’s something you’ve recently learned that made you feel empowered?


When did you last surprise yourself with how far you’ve come?


What advice would you give your past self when you first started coding?



Let’s share the wins—big and small. Someone out there is one encouraging comment away from continuing their journey.]]></summary>

You don’t need to write every line of code yourself. Instead, you explain the idea or feature, and the AI takes care of most of the typing. This new style of programming is becoming very popular, especially in 2025.
Why is everyone talking about vibe coding?
Big companies are using it


It’s changing jobs


It saves time and energy



What’s great about vibe coding?
Easier for beginners


Faster experiments


More fun



Are there any downsides?
Yes, there are a few things to watch out for:

The concepts apply broadly, whether you are creating a tutorial app or any other data-driven web application.
The app allows users to:
  Create new tutorials
  Read all tutorials or a specific one by its ID
  Update existing tutorial entries
  Delete tutorials as needed
  Search tutorials by title

🚀 Build Highlights
CSS animations for floating donuts
Interactive recipe cards with progressive steps
Local storage for saved favorite shops
Responsive layouts and lazy-loaded media
I especially enjoyed designing animated elements that add charm without clutter. I also explored food presentation in web UX and how micro-interactions improve instructional content.
Next up? I'd love to add user-submitted creations and real donut shop APIs.
Even the quirkiest holidays deserve thoughtful design — and this one was a joy to bring to life!]]></summary>
