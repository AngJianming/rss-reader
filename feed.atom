        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just messing around and having fun with the idea — but it actually works!
Tired of parsing custom syntax? I built a simple Node.js interpreter that runs programs described entirely as JSON AST.
Programs = JSON files
No parsing — just walk the AST and execute
Great for LLMs, automation, education, or building visual programming tools
Example program:
{
  "type": "program",
  "body": [
    { "type": "declare", "name": "x", "value": { "type": "number", "value": 7 } },
    { "type": "declare", "name": "y", "value": { "type": "number", "value": 3 } },
    {
      "type": "call",
      "function": "print",
      "args": [
        { "type": "add", "left": { "type": "identifier", "name": "x" }, "right": { "type": "identifier", "name": "y" } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Works out of the box, easy to extend, and perfect for machine-generated code (like LLMs or no-code).

Among the different testing techniques, black box testing vs white box testing are two core methods that every tester must understand.
Black box testing is a method of software testing where the tester does not have access to the internal code or structure of the application. Instead, the tester evaluates the software based on the expected behavior as described in the specifications.
In this testing method, you pay attention to the inputs you provide and the outputs you get back. You don’t need to worry about how the software processes the data internally or what logic it uses — your job is to verify that the software behaves as expected from the outside…]]></summary>

Template literals are an improved way to handle strings in JavaScript.
But they’re not just another way to define strings — they unlock new powers:
Insert variables or expressions directly inside strings (string interpolation)
Write multi-line strings without extra characters
Embed dynamic content cleanly
Basic Syntax
const name = 'Elayaraj';
Hello, ${name}!;
Notice:
We use **backticks** (`).

We embed variables using ${}.

Why Use Template Literals?
Let’s compare.
Without template literals:
const name = 'Elayaraj';


With template literals:

const greeting =Hello, ${name}!;
Cleaner
Easier to read
No annoying + signs everywhere
Multi-line Strings



Before template literals:

But growth alone doesn't mean your business is healthy.
In fact, plenty of SaaS startups scale before they understand whether they're making money per customer and they burn through runway chasing growth that isn't sustainable.
That's where unit economics comes in.
It answers the one question every founder needs to ask (but many avoid):
For every new customer, do you earn more than they cost you?
If you don't know the answer, your business might be quietly bleeding cash and you won't know until it's too late.
At its core:
Unit economics = how much profit (or loss) you make per customer.
It's not about top-line revenue or active users. It's about whether each customer moves your business forward or pulls it under.

TalentFilterAI is a platform designed to help recruiters and hiring managers filter and shortlist candidates based on job requirements, utilizing AI-powered email parsing with Postmark.
Recruiters can create jobs by providing a job title, description, qualifications, and requirements. Once applications are sent to the platform through Postmark Inbound Parse Feature, they are parsed, and the applicant is added to the database.
The AI parses the email to match the applicant to a job. It then analyzes the job's qualifications and requirements alongside the applicant's details to determine if the applicant meets the specified criteria.
As a recruiter, you can view applicants and their applications, and then shortlist them. The platform provides a list of applicants per job, indicating whether they have passed or failed the job requirements.

Tailwind CSS - for styling
Shadcn UI - for components
Postmark - for email parsing and email sending
Turso - for the database
Drizzle - for database ORM
Clerk - for authentication
OpenAI - for the AI
Cloudflare R2 - for file uploads
My experience with Postmark is incredible. It's a powerful tool that allows me to easily parse emails and send emails. The Portal and Documentation are very helpful, and the API is very easy to use.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey-hey! Today, I've selected an interesting topic, which is tokenization in sports. Particularly, how it affects us, developers and start-ups.
The entire sports industry is tied to the fan movement. Representatives of sports leagues have long since learned to monetize their fans, but are constantly looking for new ways to do so. The growing interest in tokenization can become a new source of revenue for sports teams and investors. Today, Info-Polus explains exactly how.
Tokenization of sports assets involves converting sports-related assets into digital tokens. These can then be used to perform a range of actions, such as trading on different platforms or confirming ownership of an asset. Everything can be tokenized, from tickets and signed items of your favorite players to stadium seats and shares.
Believe it or not, tokenization has a positive impact on every participant. Fans, clubs, teams, investors, and start-ups are already diving into it. 
Start-ups have found fertile ground in sports tokenization. They are creating platforms that facilitate the issuance, trading, and management of these digital assets. The Socios platform is a great example, becoming an important partner for many football clubs with their fan tokens. The various club cryptos can be bought and resold here. When a new football token is launched, the clubs use Socios as a platform for their “Initial Fan Token Sale” (FTO). The success of such platforms can be proved by Binance entering the game. The world's largest crypto exchange supported Socios and the Chiliz platform at the launch of the FC Barcelona token. Since then, some fan tokens can also be purchased on Binance with Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), or Binance USD (BUSD).

JavaScript provides multiple ways to select elements from the DOM:

// By class
// By tag name
// Modern way (CSS selector) [TBD]
You can update the content, attributes, or style of any element.
let title = document.getElementById('main-title');
// Change text
// Change style
You can dynamically create new HTML elements and add them to the page.
// Create a new paragraph
// Append it to the body or another element

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript has two special values that represent "nothing" or "no value": null and undefined. While they might seem similar at first, they have distinct meanings and use cases. Understanding the difference is crucial to writing clean, bug-free code.
What is undefined?
undefined is a primitive value that a variable automatically gets when:
It is declared but not initialized.
A function does not return anything explicitly.
An object property or array index does not exist.




let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
let result = greet(); // result is undefined

let obj = {};
console.log(obj.name); // undefined

Key idea: undefined means "a value hasn't been assigned yet."
What is null?


null is an intentional assignment of "no value." It’s a value you set yourself when you want to say, “this should be empty.”
let user = null;
console.log(user); // null

Key idea: null means "nothing," on purpose.
How Are They Different?



Feature
undefined
null




Type
undefined

object (quirk of JS)


Assigned by
JavaScript
Developer


Means
Not yet assigned
Intentionally empty


Equality Check

undefined == null → true

But undefined === null → false




When to Use Each



Use undefined to check if a variable or property has not been initialized.
Use null when you want to explicitly clear a value (e.g., resetting a variable or signaling "no data").
Quick Tip


Use strict equality (===) when comparing these values to avoid confusion:
if (value === null) {
  // Do something when the value is intentionally empty
} else if (value === undefined) {
  // Handle uninitialized case
}

Conclusion


null and undefined are part of JavaScript’s dynamic type system and understanding them helps you avoid bugs, especially when dealing with APIs, DOM manipulation, or large objects. Remember: undefined is JavaScript's default way of saying “no value assigned,” and null is your way of saying “intentionally empty.”]]></summary>
