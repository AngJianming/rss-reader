        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking into the tech industry as a beginner is challenging enough—but what if you’re also self-funding your learning and supporting a family? Is there a realistic path to gaining skills, earning a stipend, and balancing responsibilities without burning out?  
Let’s be honest: there’s no true shortcut to becoming proficient in tech. However, with focus and the right approach, you can accelerate your growth while managing financial and family pressures. Here’s how:  
Start with Free/Low-Cost, High-Value Resources



Platforms like freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, or CS50x (Harvard’s free intro to CS) offer structured, reputable curricula.

Supplement with YouTube tutorials (e.g., Traversy Media, Fireship) or affordable Udemy courses (wait for $10–$15 sales).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Breaking Down Projects into Manageable Tasks


Agile Planning boosts productivity by dividing complex projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. Rather than tackling the entire project at once, teams focus on specific objectives within a short time frame, making it easier to allocate resources effectively and maintain focus. This granular approach ensures that progress is visible and measurable at every stage.

At the core of Agile Planning is the concept of sprints—short work cycles where teams set clear, achievable goals. By prioritizing objectives within each sprint, Agile enables teams to concentrate on delivering the most valuable features first. This structured prioritization prevents teams from feeling overwhelmed and ensures that their efforts align with the most critical business needs.
Agile Planning emphasizes ongoing communication among team members. Daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning sessions, and reviews ensure that everyone is aligned and aware of project developments. This frequent interaction helps address issues early, avoid misunderstandings, and maintain a high level of coordination throughout the project.
A key strength of Agile Planning lies in its iterative nature. After each sprint, teams review their work, gather feedback, and refine their approach for the next cycle. This continuous improvement process helps identify what’s working and what needs adjustment, leading to more effective workflows and enhanced overall productivity.]]></summary>

You might remember how Battlefront 2’s launch microtransactions nearly blew up the galaxy (40 hours of grinding to unlock Darth Vader, ugh). EA backpedaled, ditched paid loot boxes, kept adding freebies, and eventually sunsetted support in 2020. Now fans are flocking back—and the old dev crew is keen to ride that hype into a brand-new sequel.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're building an event-driven architecture, you will probably ask yourself: NATS or Kafka?
Nats is a lightweight, simple, and very fast messaging system. It's perfect for microservices communication, IoT, and low latency scenarios.
Easy to set up and use 
Extremely low latency (millisecond)
Supports pub/sub, request/reply, and streaming (with JetStream)
No message persistency by default (JetStream adds it)
Not ideal for long message storage or heavy reprocessing
Kafka is a distributed streaming platform, great for large-scale data processing, event sourcing, and real-time analytics.
High durability and scalability
Strong support for message retention and replay
Great integration with Big Data tools
More complex to run (Zookeeper, brokers, configurations)
Higher latency compared to nats



Feature
NATS
Kafka




Latency

Delivery Guarantees
At most once / At least once*

Common Use Cases
Microservices, IoT
Analytics, Event Sourcing, ETL



You need low latency and fast communication
Your events are simples and short-lived
You want a light and easy messaging system
You need long-term retention and message replay
Event are part of your business logic (event sourcing)
You deal with large amounts of data
There’s no one-size-fits-all. The right tool depends on your specific needs.
NATS for fast and lightweight systems.
Kafka for robust and scalable systems with high durability.]]></summary>

Over the year to June 2025, core revenues jumped to £560 million (from £494.7 million), licensing revenues hit £50 million (up from £31 million), and pre-tax profits climbed to £255 million (versus £203 million).
Beyond its legendary tabletop miniatures, Games Workshop is cashing in big on IP: hit video games like Space Marine 2, animated shows (Secret Level), and an upcoming Henry Cavill-produced Warhammer 40K cinematic universe. While it warns licensing won’t keep growing at this pace, the company insists it’s bigger and stronger than ever—and it’s already teasing more expansions, from Space Marine 3 to a Dawn of War Definitive Edition.]]></summary>
