        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decorator is a powerful pattern that helps us keep our models clean while adding presentation logic. Today, I want to share my approach to implementing decorators in Ruby on Rails.
I was inspired by a great article:
Build a minimal decorator with Ruby in 30 minutes
Rémi - @remi@ruby.social
Ruby Weekly for sharing it!
What if we took a different approach? Let's solve this problem in reverse, like in the Tenet movie where time flows backwards 😈
Imagine we have
a Post model with a status enum column,
an Author model with first_name and last_name fields.
Let's create some decorators to enhance these models.
# app/decorators/post_decorator.rb

class PostDecorator < SimpleDelegator
  STATUS_COLORS = {

The Power of Image as Context
Okay, so we've all been there. You've got this beautiful design mockup, maybe a screenshot of something cool you saw online, or even just a hand-drawn sketch. Now you have to turn it into actual code. It's like trying to explain a dream to someone – something always gets lost in translation. But what if the image could just... be the code? That's the idea behind using images as context. It's about letting the visual speak directly to the machine, cutting out the human middleman (and all the potential for error).
Think of it as giving your images API access to Canva Code. Instead of manually interpreting designs, the AI can 'see' what you want and generate code that matches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2025, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) remain essential pillars of modern software development. With faster release cycles, growing infrastructure complexity, and distributed engineering teams, automating builds and deployments isn't a luxury, it's a necessity.
Two of the most popular CI/CD platforms in the developer ecosystem today are GitHub Actions and CircleCI. Both offer powerful features, flexible workflows, and generous free tiers, but which one is the right fit for your team?
In this article, we’ll compare GitHub Actions and CircleCI side-by-side from setup and ease of use to performance, pricing, and real-world use cases, to help you make an informed choice for your 2025 development workflow.
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built natively into GitHub. It allows you to automate your workflows directly within your repositories using simple YAML configuration files. Since it’s tightly integrated with GitHub itself, it's a natural choice for teams already managing their code and issues on the platform.
Highlights:
Integrated seamlessly into your GitHub repo UI

Uses YAML-based .github/workflows directory

Supports workflows for builds, tests, deployments, cron jobs, and more

Marketplace with thousands of pre-built actions (e.g., test runners, deploy scripts)
🔧 *Best for teams already on GitHub looking for a tightly integrated, lightweight automation solution. *
CircleCI is a powerful cloud-native CI/CD platform known for its performance, flexibility, and scalability. It supports Docker, Linux, macOS, and Windows environments, and offers advanced capabilities like parallelism, caching, and insights dashboards for more complex projects.
Highlights:
Supports projects from GitHub or Bitbucket

Configuration via .circleci/config.yml

Rich UI for visualizing workflows

Native Docker support + Orbs (reusable config packages)

Strong analytics and parallel build features
⚙️ Best for engineering teams that want advanced CI/CD control, faster builds, and detailed insights.]]></summary>

Just a few years ago, I was sitting in a college computer lab, proudly printing “Hello World” in C, thinking I had arrived. Spoiler: I hadn’t.
When I started my B.Tech in Computer Science, I wasn’t totally new to code—I’d dabbled in C++ and had made some static websites with HTML and CSS back in school. But like many students, I quickly realized that just knowing how to center a div doesn’t exactly make you “industry-ready.”

This intellectual pursuit challenges participants to achieve a desired outcome from an AI or Large Language Model (LLM) using the absolute minimum number of prompts. It's a game of precision, foresight, and an intricate understanding of how these powerful models interpret and respond to human language.
Much like its namesake, AI Golf rewards efficiency. Every prompt is a "stroke," and the goal is to reach the "hole" – the desired AI output – in the fewest strokes possible. This isn't just a quirky pastime; it reflects a crucial skill in the age of generative AI: prompt engineering at its most refined.

Our payment processing API was peaking at 80% CPU usage on a 16-core server, yet only one core was doing most of the work. Node.js’s single-threaded nature was holding us back, but the solution wasn’t obvious:
Should we use clustering? (Fork processes)
Or Worker Threads? (Share memory, but not state)
We benchmarked both. Here’s what we learned.
Option 1: Clustering (Forking Processes)



  
  
  How It Works




Master process forks multiple Node.js instances (one per CPU core).
Each process has its own memory, event loop, and V8 instance.
Best For:


✔ Stateless APIs (e.g., REST services)
Crash isolation (one process dying doesn’t kill others)
Simple scaling (cluster module makes it easy)
The Catch:

Essentials of JavaScript: variables, data types, and operators. It reminded me how mastering these basics is crucial, especially when debugging complex applications. Understanding how JavaScript handles type coercion, Booleans, and logical operators gave me a refreshed perspective on writing cleaner, more predictable code.
Control Flow That Matters
Arrays, Objects & Functions – The Real Backbone
Better Error Handling, Fewer Bugs
Functional and Object-Oriented Thinking
Functional programming (pure functions, recursion, scope)
Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, constructors)
This duality helped me better understand how to architect different parts of a web app depending on the use case—especially when juggling state management and component structure in modern frameworks.
Working with Modern JavaScript Features
JavaScript in the Browser
Testing and Tooling: The Often-Ignored Hero
Final Thoughts
If you're working with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue, or diving into backend with Node.js, this kind of deep dive will only make you better.
My advice? Never stop learning. Relearn the fundamentals. They’re your most powerful tools.
