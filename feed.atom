        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


In TypeScript, you can define custom shapes using type aliases or interface. But when it comes to choosing between them, many developers ask: "TypeScript Type vs Interface?" The answer is increasingly clear: use type.
While both share similarities, type offers more flexibility, supports complex patterns, and aligns better with modern TypeScript and frameworks. In this guide, you'll learn the differences, strengths, and why type is the better default.
Both type and interface define object shapes or function signatures:
// Using type
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
type SetPoint = (x: number, y: number) => void;

// Using interface
interface Point { x: number; y: number }
interface SetPoint { (x: number, y: number): void }

Developers, once primarily focused on writing code and building applications, are increasingly stepping into a new role: that of AI workflow designers. This transformation is not driven by a deliberate career pivot but by the rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into the development process. These tools are reshaping how software is built, tested, and deployed, turning developers into "accidental architects" who orchestrate complex AI-driven workflows rather than solely crafting lines of code.

Does it feel like you always need to make an extra effort to turn your code testable but you're not exactly sure why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Technical Evaluation of Milvus and Chroma DB
In the rapidly evolving AI infrastructure landscape, vector databases have emerged as critical components for handling high-dimensional data. This analysis examines two prominent contenders—Milvus and Chroma DB—through the lens of enterprise readiness and developer experience, providing actionable insights for technical teams.  
Architectural Philosophy & Deployment


Performance Benchmarks 


Milvus achieves 15,000 QPS on 768D vectors with 8ms p95 latency (32-node cluster)  


Chroma DB manages 2,300 QPS at 28ms latency (standalone instance)

The gap widens with complex operations: Milvus' proprietary ANNS algorithms outperform Chroma's FAISS-based implementation by 40% in recall accuracy at 1M+ scale. However, Chroma's memory-mapped indexes demonstrate advantages for frequent schema modifications during development cycles.  


Ecosystem Integration


Native PyTorch/TensorFlow data loaders  


Automated versioning for vector snapshots  


Grafana/Prometheus monitoring templates

Chroma prioritizes LLM workflows with:  


LangChain integration out-of-the-box  


OpenAI embedding API compatibility  


Dynamic metadata filtering optimized for RAG pipelines  


Enterprise Readiness 


Cost Considerations 



Technical Recommendation 
Both platforms continue evolving—Milvus recently added GPU-accelerated indexing, while Chroma introduced hybrid scalar-vector search in Q2 2024. Technical leaders should evaluate these systems through the prism of their operational maturity and scalability requirements rather than seeking a universal solution.  
Note: All benchmark data reflects testing on AWS c6i.8xlarge instances with 500M 512D vectors unless otherwise specified.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I dived into the world of CSS transitions, and I was excited to see how a small piece of code can make a website feel more smooth and interactive. In this post, I’ll share what I learned and how transitions work in CSS.
CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration) instead of instantly. For example, instead of a button changing color immediately when hovered, transitions let that color change happen gradually.
Here’s the basic syntax of a CSS transition:
selector {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}

property: The CSS property you want to animate (e.g., background-color, width, transform)
duration: How long the transition takes (e.g., 0.5s, 1s)
timing-function (optional): The speed curve (e.g., ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out)
delay (optional): The delay before the transition starts
<button class="btn">Hover Me</button>

.btn {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.btn:hover {
  background-color: #2E7D32;
}

When you hover over the button, the background color changes smoothly from green to dark green in 0.3 seconds.
You can transition multiple properties like this:
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
  transition: width 0.5s, background-color 0.3s;
}

.box:hover {
  width: 200px;
  background-color: blue;
}

Only animatable properties can be transitioned (e.g., color, background-color, transform, opacity, width, height, etc.)
Use transition: all if you want all animatable properties to transition — but use it carefully, as it can affect performance.
Combine transitions with pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, or :active for better interactivity.
Learning CSS transitions opened my eyes to how much they can improve the user experience of a website. They're simple to use but make a big impact visually. I’m excited to explore more about animations using @keyframes and the animation property next!]]></summary>

The Jakarta-based Nasdaq-listed company said on May 19 that its board of directors approved creating a Bitcoin (BTC) “treasury reserve” and it was “committing up to 50% of any net profits generated to fund the acquisition of BTC.”
DigiAsia said it was also “actively exploring a capital raise of up to US$100 million” to kickstart its Bitcoin holdings and would look to earn yield on its holdings through means like lending and staking.

DigiAsia said it had “initiated discussions with regulated partners” on yield strategies and managing its planned Bitcoin holdings. The company added that it was also assessing whether to offer conver…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. 
In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.
She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.
In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it’s a “…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender.

 A daily timeframe bearish divergence signals fading momentum, raising doubt on BTC’s ability to rally into the $120,000 to $130,000 range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Though the exact number of attendees was unknown as of May 19, reports and blockchain data have revealed some of the tokenholders who qualified to apply for the May 22 dinner and “VIP tour” and reception, presumed to be in the White House. Bloomberg reported on May 7 that more than half of the 220 wallets were likely controlled by foreign nationals.

Circle is seeking at least $5 billion, which is its target for the IPO, according to the four banking and private equity sources Fortune cited. Ripple tried to purchase Circle on April 30, but the $4 billion to $5 billion bid was rejected as being too low.

If Ripple or Coinbase were to buy Circle, the details of a purchase would differ. Ripple would pay using cash and XRP (XRP), a cryptocurrency that Ripple created. Coinbase, on the other hand, would use cash and stock.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

Input Output Global (IOG) is preparing to release an audit report on its treasury holdings after fresh allegations surfaced claiming misappropriation of roughly $600 million worth of ADA tokens.  
Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson is facing renewed scrutiny from community members, including non-fungible token artist Masato Alexander, who alleged that Hoskinson manipulated the Cardano ledger using a “genesis key to rewrite it and take control” of $619 million worth of Cardano (ADA) during the network’s 2021 Allegra hard fork.

This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.
What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position.

According to a May 19 announcement, Strategy acquired 7,390 BTC for about $764.9 million at an average price just under $103,500. Strategy reported a Bitcoin yield of 16.3% year-to-date. Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor made his usual hint at the purchase in a May 18 X post.
