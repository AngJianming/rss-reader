So what happens when your infrastructure breaks?
If your DR plan is still a few backup scripts and tribal knowledge, this post is for you. Let’s talk disaster recovery (DR) from a DevOps/Infra-as-Code (IaC) perspective — what it should look like, and how to make it part of your daily workflow.
Cloud Business Continuity = Keep things running

Disaster Recovery = Recover fast when they don’t
If your Terraform codebase is the source of truth, then cloud DR is your ability to rebuild infra from code, not just restore data blobs.
Here’s what’s at stake:

New to dev.to and loving the vibes already. I'm on this exciting journey exploring the intersection of code and design.
Just discovered Martin Lorenz's work on flexible visual systems and I'm completely fascinated. Feels like a beautiful approach to creating meaningful design systems in an age where AI can pump out content so quickly.
Inspired by his approach, I built this little prototype:
https://codepen.io/spaghettifunction/pen/myJEoYo
It's a grid system where each cell responds to mouse interaction while influencing its neighbors. Nothing groundbreaking, but it felt magical watching those simple rules create complex, beautiful behaviors.
Systematic thinking meets creative expression
Simple rules creating complex emergent behavior


Interactive design that feels alive, not static
For those familiar with generative/systematic design:
Who else should I be exploring? 
Any favorite examples of flexible visual systems?
What draws you to this intersection of code + design?
Still very much learning and would love to hear your thoughts!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to Start a SwiftUI App in 2025


Starting a SwiftUI app in 2025 means embracing the latest Swift and Apple technologies to build modern, fast, and maintainable iOS applications. Whether you’re a beginner or updating your skills, here’s a step-by-step guide to get your SwiftUI app up and running.
Install the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store (Xcode 15 or newer).
Make sure your macOS is updated to support the latest Xcode.
Familiarize yourself with the Swift 5.9+ language features introduced recently.
Open Xcode and choose "Create a new Xcode project."
Select "App" under the iOS tab.
Name your project (e.g., SwiftShelfApp).
Ensure "Swift" is selected as the language and "SwiftUI" as the interface.
The main entry point is marked with the @main attribute.
Your ContentView.swift uses SwiftUI’s declarative syntax.
Learn the basic building blocks like View, State, Binding, and ObservableObject.
Start by modifying ContentView.swift:
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var counter = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Welcome to SwiftShelf!")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
            Text("You’ve tapped \(counter) times")
                .font(.headline)
            Button("Tap Me") {
                counter += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

Press Cmd+R to build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.
Interact with the button to see your app respond.
Experiment with lists, navigation, and data flow.
Learn about Combine framework for reactive programming.
Follow Apple’s official SwiftUI tutorials and documentation.
By starting with these steps, you’ll build a solid foundation for SwiftUI development in 2025 and beyond. Keep coding and exploring new features as Apple updates the ecosystem!
Happy coding! 🚀]]></summary>

Move faster
Stay consistent

This includes organizing permissions, naming, and tags.
But here’s the kicker: just because you built the modules… doesn’t mean anyone’s actually using them.

📊 Side-by-Side API Feature Breakdown
🧠 The Difference: Intelligence vs. Information
Great for charts and stats
But zero insight into what the data means
Token Metrics:
Generates Trader Grades (0–100) per token
Assigns bullish/bearish signals based on technical & sentiment inputs
Offers Investor Grades for long-term health
This lets you or your app act before price moves—not after.
💡 Developer Use Cases Where Token Metrics Wins
Signal Bots
Trigger buy/sell trades using bull/bear flips and AI grades.
Sentiment Dashboards
Display crowd mood without building a custom NLP engine.
Portfolio Builders
Offer users thematic token baskets ranked by AI, not hype.
Smart Watchlists
Show only top-graded tokens based on AI signals.
🔧 Developer Support & Speed
With Token Metrics, you're building on the same stack that powers hedge-fund-grade signal engines.
⚖️ Verdict
If you're just displaying charts, use CoinGecko or CMC.
 If you're trying to outperform the market or build a tool that gives others that power—go with Token Metrics.
It’s not just an API. It’s your crypto edge.]]></summary>
