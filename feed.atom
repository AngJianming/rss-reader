RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems as a use case to illustrate the concepts.

So what do we mean with cognitive architectures patterns? We lend this term from a thought-provoking post by Harrison Chase (Langchain), in which he classifies architectures for AI by their level of autonomy:

Let's go through them quickly:
1. Level: Code 

Every step and call is hard coded. This is classic code without any LLM involvement.


2. Level: LLM Call


3. Level: Chain


4. Level: Router


5. Level: State Machine


6. Level: Autonomous Agents

Too good to be true?
Serverless Full Stack really the future of modern development?
Let’s dig into it. 👇

Exactly Is a Serverless Full Stack?


It's not "no servers" — it's no server management.
Serverless full stack means using services like:
Frontend: React, Next.js, or Vue (deployed on Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
Backend: Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, etc.)
Database: Supabase, Firebase, PlanetScale
Auth: Clerk, Auth0, or Firebase Auth
Storage & APIs: S3, Cloudinary, Stripe, etc.
💡 You focus on writing features — the cloud handles the heavy lifting.
Zero Server Maintenance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In an era where digital agility defines business success, enterprises can no longer afford to wait weeks—or months—for IT teams to build internal tools, automate workflows, or support evolving business needs. Today’s IT Service Management (ITSM) demands speed, flexibility, and collaboration across departments.
But there's a problem: most IT teams are stretched thin. Between incident resolution, system upgrades, compliance audits, and managing change requests, traditional development backlogs are longer than ever.
That’s where citizen developers and low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms come in.
In this blog, we explore how LCNC platforms are empowering business users to contribute directly to ITSM processes—reducing dependency on developers, accelerating innovation, and transforming how internal services are built and delivered.
💡 What Are Citizen Developers?
Why this matters in ITSM: ITSM spans every department—from HR ticketing to facilities requests, procurement approvals, and onboarding processes. Allowing business users to build and customize these flows themselves (within governance limits) reduces turnaround times dramatically and improves cross-functional alignment.
🚀 The Rise of Low-Code/No-Code in ITSM
ServiceNow App Engine
In ITSM, these platforms are being used to:
Automate onboarding/offboarding workflows
The LCNC Way (Built on ServiceNow App Engine):
HR built a custom onboarding form with drag-and-drop fields
✅ Onboarding time reduced by 70%
Area    Recommendation
📊 Business Impact of LCNC + Citizen Dev in ITSM
Our LCNC practice helps:
Identify high-impact use cases
By embracing LCNC and empowering citizen developers, organizations can respond faster, deliver better, and scale smarter.
✅ Call to Action
📞 Book a strategy session with our LCNC + ITSM experts at MJB Technologies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to SSH into your Android phone like it's a real Linux server? With Termux, Ubuntu, and Tailscale, you can do exactly that — without root!
This guide walks you through setting up a fully functional Ubuntu environment inside Termux, exposing it via Tailscale, and making it the default shell on your phone. By the end, you'll be able to SSH into your phone from any device in your tailnet.
🧰 Prerequisites
Android phone
Tailscale installed and connected on both your phone and your PC
Termux installed via F-Droid (not from Play Store — it’s deprecated!)
Some Linux experience
⚠️ If You See This Error…
You likely installed Termux from the Play Store, which is broken on modern Android.
✅ Step 1: Install Ubuntu (or any other distro) in Termux Using proot-distro
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install proot-distro
proot-distro list
proot-distro install ubuntu

To enter Ubuntu:
proot-distro login ubuntu

✅ Step 2: Make Ubuntu the Default Shell in Termux
Edit the startup script:



nano ~/.bash_profile

Add this to the end of the file:



if [ -z "$PROOT_DISTRO_NAME" ]; then
  proot-distro login ubuntu-22.04
fi

This prevents recursive launches if you’re already inside Ubuntu.
Reopen Termux
Now you'll land directly inside Ubuntu every time you open Termux. 🎉
✅ Step 3: Set Up SSH Server Inside Ubuntu
Launch Ubuntu:
proot-distro login ubuntu

Then run:
apt update && apt install openssh-server
passwd  # Set root password
service ssh start

Now your SSH server is live on Ubuntu inside Termux.
✅ Step 4: SSH Into Your Phone via Tailscale
From your PC:
If you want to ssh into Ubuntu inside termux
ssh root@ip -p 8022

or you can ssh into termux's shell by first:
Inside termux
whoami # it should be something like u0_a124

Then from your pc or other host device:
ssh u0_a124@ip -p 8022

You can change the port in the sshd_config, or use the default 8022 if inside Termux.]]></summary>

Let's start from the basics, what is State?
State can be defined as an object that houses data which changes over time in an application. In other words, state is a dynamic data storage that provides a mechanism for components to manage, keep track of changing data, and trigger re-rendering when it is updated.
State management is like the brain of your app. It remembers everything the app needs to know at any moment — such as what you've typed in a form, whether you're signed in, or what screen you're looking at.
