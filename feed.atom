        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By the looks of it, malware and vulnerabilities are not going anywhere anytime soon. However, with the hard work of defenders and constant education of the end users, we can reduce the risk and threat that they pose to our society.
With the rise (or publicity) of genAI, normal users found a new productive tool, and malicious users added a potent weapon to their arsenal.
All these are what we are about to discuss in this week's edition of our security review.
Millions of low-cost Android devices turn home networks into crime platforms


If you want cheap products, this article should make you think again. In addition, the malware in question has been active for almost a decade. And to say that it packs some punch would be an understatement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever opened Twitter or YouTube just to learn something useful…but ended up watching 2 hours of unrelated content?
Yeah. Same.
The Trap
I used to think social media was my shortcut to “stay updated” in tech and cybersecurity.
In reality?

It became a trap.
One moment I’m watching a useful tutorial.

Next moment I’m lost in meme threads, hot takes, and tech debates with no action plan.
It felt productive — but I wasn’t really learning anything deeply.
Why This Happens
Most social media platforms are built to keep you scrolling, not studying.
They reward:
Fast content
Shocking headlines
Short dopamine loops
Meanwhile, real learning requires:
Focus

Depth

Reflection



What I’m Doing Differently Now
To fix this, I started doing 4 simple things:
✅ I learn offline first — from proper courses, books, or docs

✅ I follow creators who share value (not just vibes)

✅ I take notes, apply what I learn, and write blog posts (like this one!)

✅ I block out focused learning time before I go online
*Why I'm Blogging Here on Dev.to

I wanted a space to share what I’m learning in tech and cybersecurity — without the distractions.
So I joined Dev.to.
Expect:
Beginner-friendly posts

Tech notes from my learning journey

Honest stories from a student figuring it out in public
If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by online content or struggled to stay consistent, let’s connect. You’re not alone.
How do YOU stay focused when learning tech online?

💻 I completed 7 singleplayer levels and I played multiplayer levels daily on CodeCombat! ✨
The list of singleplayer levels completed is incorrect but at least some is shown correctly but you should get the idea  
🎯 I met my weekly target on Codecademy! ✨
I refreshed on the Python 2 course and finished project DNA Analysis  
  
I am a series of small victories and large defeats and I am as amazed as any other that I have gotten from there to here.
Thank you for reading! ♡

Yet, many marketers still rely on semi-fictional archetypes, pieced together from educated guesses and sparse data. The result? Campaigns that often miss their mark, speaking to an audience rather than with them. Imagine, instead, a world where your personas are not just static profiles, but living, breathing representations of your actual customers, illuminated by deep, real-time insights. This isn't a future fantasy; it's the present reality, thanks to the strategic application of artificial intelligence.

As privacy concerns continue to grow among users, building trust through thoughtful data handling has become essential for app success.
Privacy isn't just a compliance checkbox—it's about building genuine alignment between what users expect and what your app actually does with their data. As Steve Jobs noted in 2010, privacy means "people knowing what they're signing up for, in plain language, and repeatedly."
The foundation rests on three key concepts: privacy is fundamentally about people and how technology impacts them, it involves the processing of personal data, and it requires respecting the context and expectations around that information.
Apple's approach centers on four core principles:

But let's be honest, crafting compelling video scripts – the kind that capture attention, build trust, and drive action – is a significant undertaking. It demands creativity, an understanding of audience psychology, and a knack for concise storytelling. What if you could amplify that process, moving from concept to high-converting script with unprecedented speed and precision?
Enter artificial intelligence. AI isn't here to replace the imaginative spark of a human marketer, but rather to serve as an incredibly powerful co-pilot.
