        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a discovery that feels closer to science fiction than science news, researchers have identified more than two hundred previously unknown giant viruses in the ocean. These enormous viruses, many larger than some bacteria, are offering a fresh perspective on how marine ecosystems function and how the smallest forms of life shape the planet.
Unlike the fast replicating viruses we usually hear about, giant viruses are something else entirely. They carry vast genomes filled with unexpected genes. Some of these genes appear to be borrowed from their hosts, including genes linked to photosynthesis. That means these viruses can potentially tweak the way algae absorb carbon dioxide, influencing global carbon cycles in ways we are only beginning to understand.
The team behind the discovery used advanced genetic tools to scan ocean water samples and piece together fragments of viral DNA. What they found was stunning. Not only were these giant viruses diverse, but many of them seem to be deeply connected to the health of marine food webs. Some may even help regulate harmful algal blooms or support the survival of specific ocean microbes.
This discovery is more than just a catalog of weird viral life. It is a reminder that the ocean is still full of unknowns. These giant viruses could hold keys to everything from climate science to biotechnology, offering new ways to study evolution, build tools from nature, or even create novel therapies.
In a time when most headlines focus on crises, this news gives us something else entirely. Curiosity. Wonder. And a deeper appreciation for the hidden complexity of life beneath the waves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excel is a spreadsheet tool made by Microsoft that helps you organize, analyze, and visualize data. It's basically a super-smart digital notebook that works with tables, numbers, and charts.
It is used in the real world in many industries including Business and finance for budgeting and forecasting, financial analysis. Project management for scheduling tasks, managing deadlines, Human resources for employee records, payroll, leave tracking. In Sales and marketing its used for keeping customer data, monitoring performance etc. Last but not least excel is used by Data Analysts to clean the data eg by removing duplicates, handling missing values or fixing formats. Data analysts also use excel to do exploratory data analysis, that is understanding the data trends, outliers or relationships. They also use excel formulas to analyze the data and build interactive dashboards.
Excel has many features and formulas including but not limited to Basic math functions, SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX. Text functions, LEFT, RIGHT, LEN, MID, TRIM. Date and time functions, TODAY, NOW, DATEDIF. Lookup functions, VLOOKUP, which Searches for a value in the first column of a table and returns a value in the same row from another column. Imagine you have a list of employee names and their departments in a table. You can use VLOOKUP to find out which department an employee belongs to. PivotTables, which summarizes large datasets quickly and easily. You can group, filter, and aggregate data (e.g., totals, averages) without writing formulas. IF,AND,OR logical functions checks if conditions are true or false. 
Excel lets me feel in control of data. Whether it's tracking tasks, analyzing sales, or categorizing discounts, there's always a function or feature that makes things easier. It’s also taught me to think logically, break down problems, and look for patterns, skills that go beyond spreadsheets.]]></summary>

Microsoft Excel is a popular tool that helps people organize, analyze, and make sense of data. While it might look like just a grid of rows and columns, Excel is much more than that—it’s a flexible platform for working with numbers, spotting trends, and turning raw information into clear, actionable insights using formulas, charts, and interactive tools.
How Excel is Used in Real Life for Data Analysis
Tracking Business Performance
Handling Finances and Budgets
Analyzing Marketing Campaigns
Excel Features and Formulas I've learned
Pivot Charts and Tables
Conditional Formatting
INDEX and MATCH Functions
MY PERSONAL REFLECTION
I used to think data was messy - this overwhelming block of numbers and text that was incredibly hard to interpret. Raw datasets felt like puzzles with missing pieces, and drawing meaningful conclusions seemed impossible. However, learning Excel's features this week has completely transformed my perspective.
Now I can see how straightforward data analysis can become with proper tools and techniques. Good data cleaning establishes a solid foundation, while visualization features like charts and conditional formatting reveal patterns that were previously hidden. What once appeared as chaotic information now presents clear stories and actionable insights.
Most importantly, I've learned that effective data analysis isn't about having the most sophisticated tools - it's about asking the right questions and using available features strategically. Excel has shown me that even seemingly simple tools can unlock powerful insights when applied thoughtfully.]]></summary>

If Erlang is already very capable, why learn Elixir? The answer lies in the improved developer experience and productivity that Elixir offers.




Elixir is a functional programming language designed for writing clean, concise, and expressive code on top of the BEAM virtual machine. With its modern syntax and developer-friendly design, Elixir makes it easier to read, maintain, and scale applications.
Elixir code is compiled into BEAM bytecode and runs on the Erlang runtime, making it fully compatible with the Erlang ecosystem. This means we can use Erlang libraries in Elixir projects and vice versa. This…]]></summary>

Durante meus estudos sobre EDA (Event Driven Architecture) ou Arquitetura orientada a eventos eu esbarrei com a sigla CQRS, que a gente acaba vendo com uma certa frequência em posts pela internet, então resolvi trazer um post dedicado a ela.
A sigla CQRS significa Command Query Responsibility Segregation, que traduzindo para o português seria separação de responsabilidade de comando e consulta. De forma bem simples, o CQRS propõe separar as operações feitas pelo software entre comandos e consultas.
Vamos às definições, no contexto do CQRS um comando é toda operação que muda o estado, ou seja, update, delete, insert, qualquer comando de escrita. Enquanto uma consulta o nome diz por si só, é apenas uma consulta nos dados.
É importa
De forma simples e direta você vai usar o CQRS para segregar comandos e consultas buscando desempenho, pois é comum aliado ao CQRS que você também tenha um banco apenas para consulta e um banco apenas para alterações ou comandos no caso. Porém não significa que ao usar CQRS você deve trabalhar com dois bancos de dados dessa forma.
Esse texto ficou muito mais curto do que gostaria, porém, a explicação do que é CQRS é bem mais simples do que eu imaginava. Muito do conteúdo que achei usava CQRS e mais alguma coisa para explicar o mesmo o que acabava atrapalhando um pouco, a meu ver. Então gostaria de deixar esse texto direto e compacto, espero que tenha te ajudado!
