HarmonyOS NEXT recommends using the Navigation component for page navigation and stack management, combined with Tab for multi-page switching. This article provides a detailed guide on how to use Navigation and Tab components to build a complete routing structure: splash page → main page (multi-Tab) → secondary pages.
After creating a new ArkTS project, it is recommended to rename the default Index page to EntryView, and update related configurations in ets/entryability/EntryAbility, ets/resources/base/profile/main_pages, etc. Core code example:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[在鸿蒙应用开发中，页面路由和多页面管理是非常核心的能力。HarmonyOS NEXT推荐使用Navigation组件进行页面跳转和堆栈管理，并结合Tab实现多页面切换。本文将详细介绍如何通过Navigation和Tab组件，搭建一个启动页-主页（多Tab）-二级页面的完整路由结构。
在新建ArkTS项目后，建议将默认的Index页面重命名为EntryView，并在ets/entryability/EntryAbility、ets/resources/base/profile/main_pages等相关配置中同步修改。核心代码如下：
@Entry
@Component
struct EntryView {
    build() {
        // 页面内容
    }
}

HarmonyOS推荐全局只维护一个Navigation实例，统一管理页面堆栈。实现步骤如下：
@Provide('pageStack') pageStack: NavPathStack = new NavPathStack();

其他页面通过@Consume('pageStack')获取该对象，实现页面跳转：
@Consume('pageStack') pageStack: NavPathStack
const navPath: NavPathInfo = new NavPathInfo('AboutMePage', undefined);
this.pageStack.pushPath(navPath);

通过@Builder装饰器，根据name参数动态返回对应页面组件：
@Builder
pageMap(name: string, param: object) {
    if (name === 'HomePage') {
        HomePage()
    } else i…]]></summary>

Learning is a personal journey, and you’ll eventually find what works best for you. But if you're feeling stuck, unmotivated, or unsure of how to move forward with coding, these tips might help give you some direction.
Coding is hard, but it’s even harder without a strategy, especially if you don’t have a clear plan or good study habits. You might feel like you know something because you watched a tutorial or followed along with a project, but that doesn’t always translate to actual understanding or skill.
Even if you already have some knowledge, there’s always room to improve, and these strategies can help you do just that:
1. Do Project-Based Learning
2. Understand the What, Why, and How
Understanding these layers will give you real mastery and allow you to apply your knowledge flexibly across different situations.
3. Use High-Quality Resources
4. Ask Questions When You’re Confused
5. Build Strong Study Habits
6. Prepare to Struggle
7. Always Look for Improvement in Your Code
8. Don’t Rely on AI
9. Use Spaced Repetition or Take Quizzes
10. Take Risks and Have a Growth Mindset
11. Have a Clear Roadmap
Wandering aimlessly is one of the biggest traps in learning to code. Create or follow a roadmap. Know what you’re learning next and why. Whether it's front-end, back-end, or full-stack, having a clear path helps you stay focused and motivated.]]></summary>

When modeling complex systems using Domain-Driven Design (DDD), one of the most common dilemmas architects and engineers face is:  
“If two bounded contexts use the same concept — like a Customer — should they share a common model or have separate ones?”
Take, for example, Sales and Support systems within an organization. Both deal with a Customer, but they use that concept differently. So what’s the right way to model this scenario in line with DDD principles?

The tangled noodle knot represents the complex call stack, where each recursive call dives deeper into the problem
Pulling a single strand mirrors unwinding one recursive step from the stack

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As programmers, we know how important it is to document our code properly—especially using Javadoc. But let's be honest: writing detailed comments every time we create a new class or method can be tedious and time-consuming.
If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, there's a convenient way to automate this without installing any third-party plugins. This post is a quick reference to help streamline your environment setup across machines and save time during development.
To automatically insert Javadoc when creating a new class or interface:
Navigate to:
File → Settings → Editor → File and Code Templates → Files → Class

Replace the default template with the following content:




/**
 * @ClassName ${NAME}
 * @Description TODO
 * @Author ${USER}
 * @Date ${DATE} ${TIME}
 * @Version 1.0
 */
public class ${NAME} {

}

Now, every time you create a new class or interface, this Javadoc block will be generated automatically. 🚀
To generate Javadoc for methods quickly:
Go to:
File → Settings → Editor → Live Templates

Click the + icon on the right → Select Template Group... → Create a new group (e.g., JavaDoc)
Select the new group → Click + again → Choose Live Template

Set Abbreviation to * (or any shortcut you like)
Add the following to the Template Text:




*
 * @Author $user$
 * @Description //TODO
 * @Date $date$ $time$
 * @Param $param$
 * @return $return$
 **/

Click Define at the bottom → Select Java to restrict the template to Java files
Click Edit variables and configure them as needed (you can refer to the IntelliJ IDEA documentation or use defaults)
Once configured, you can type:
/**

Then press Tab, and IntelliJ will expand it into a Javadoc template like this:

That’s it! You’ve now got a fast, repeatable way to generate documentation without slowing down your flow.
This configuration is a small investment of time that pays off with improved productivity and consistency in your codebase. It’s especially handy when switching environments or setting up a new workspace.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.
HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July
In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.
"These are all scams do not fall for any of these," Troy Lindsey wrote after receiving a copy of the phishing letter.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

“Bitcoin Treasury Companies will hold 50% of all BTC, way more than most Bitcoiners are prepared for,” Jesse Myers said in a May 23 X thread.
Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers
Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.
Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collatera…]]></summary>

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Members of the US House of Representatives called for the Justice Department to investigate Donald Trump’s May 22 dinner for his top memecoin investors, citing concerns about “foreign influence over US policy decisions” and “potential corruption and emoluments clause violations.”
In a May 22 letter to the Justice Department, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry over the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution.

Short-term Bitcoin holders realized $11.6 billion in profit over the past 30 days, suggesting a potential pause or local top in the market.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recently hit a new all-time high of $111,800, but the bullish momentum may slow down as onchain data from Glassnode reveals significant profit-taking by short-term holders (STHs), potentially signaling a market "breather."
