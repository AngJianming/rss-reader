WWDC 2025 delivered one of Apple’s most developer-focused events in years. From a sweeping “Liquid Glass” design refresh to powerful under-the-hood updates, there was no shortage of news for those of us building apps for the Apple ecosystem. Below, I break down each major theme—everything you need to know.
What Changed: Across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS, Apple introduced a translucent, fluid aesthetic that some are already likening to Windows 7’s Aero.


Pros & Cons:



Pros: A fresh, modern vibe; consistent visual language across all platforms.


Cons: Blurred text in Messages can hit accessibility and contrast in edge cases, and animations feel sluggish unless you enable “reduced motion” (which brings its own quirks).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In HarmonyOS development, the need to modify image colors often arises in scenarios such as theme switching, status indication, or style unification. The following comprehensively covers technical principles, implementation methods, and optimization strategies across various scenarios including vector graphics, bitmaps, and dynamic rendering:

  1. Core Principles and Use Cases


Vector graphics (e.g., SVG, AI) describe shapes through mathematical paths, allowing direct modification of fill colors using the fillColor property. Advantages include:  
Lightweight Rendering: No additional resource files required; color changes via property configuration


Dynamic Responsiveness: Real-time color switching based on runtime states (e.g., theme mode, interaction state)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧠 Automating My Day Like a Boss: My AI Assistant Setup with Runner H
This is the kind of assistant I always wished I had — and now I do.
🎯 What My Runner H Agent Does
Checks my email, school dashboard, and calendar for:
Homework deadlines
Upcoming tests
Events or schedule changes
Important messages
Prioritises tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix:
Creates a Daily Focus Document (Google Doc) with:
✅ Top Priorities
⚡ Quick Wins
📌 Reminders
📋 Notes (summarised from long messages/emails)
Posts a short summary in Discord:
Top 3 tasks
⚠️ Urgent alerts
Calm, focused tone like a productivity coach
🧪 How I Built It
“Act as my personal executive assistant. Every morning at 7:30am, scan my inbox, school dashboard, and calendar. Collect homework deadlines, upcoming tests, events, and urgent messages. Organise them using the Eisenhower Matrix. Create a daily focus doc in Google Docs with Top Priorities, Quick Wins, Reminders, and Notes (summarised from long messages). Then, post a short 3-sentence summary in Discord with the top task and any urgent alerts. Use a calm, focused tone.”
I linked:
Gmail
Google Calendar
Google Docs
Discord (via webhook)
I added test data to simulate deadlines and announcements. It worked beautifully. The daily document was clean and helpful, and the Discord message gave me just the right nudge to start my day.
💡 Why This Matters
🔧 Test It Yourself
A Gmail account
A calendar with events or assignments
Google Docs connected in Runner H
A Discord webhook URL
📢 Community Sharing
Follow @hcompany_ai for updates and let’s push the future of work forward. 💼⚡
🏆 Why I Think This Could Win
Follows a proven task management method (Eisenhower Matrix)
Simple but powerful routine — not just flashy, but useful
Clear documentation, easy to replicate
Adds a human touch with a calming tone
Thanks for reading — and good luck to everyone in the challenge!
Let’s build the future. 🧠⚙️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can upload multiple files using multer in Node.js and return their filenames. Here's how:
1. Setup Express & Multer
npm install express multer cors

2. Configure the Server
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: './uploads/',
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, Date.now() + '-' + file.originalname);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.array('files', 10), (req, res) => {
    const filenames = req.files.map(file => file.filename);
    res.json({ message: 'Files uploaded successfully', filenames });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

3. Frontend Fetch Request
<input type="file" id="fileInput" multiple>
<button onclick="uploadFiles()">Upload</button>

<script>
function uploadFiles() {
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    const files = fileInput.files;
    const formData = new FormData();

    for (let file of files) {
        formData.append('files', file);
    }

    fetch('http://localhost:3000/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log('Uploaded Files:', data.filenames))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
</script>


4. Running the Project
Open the HTML file in your browser.
Select multiple files and click "Upload."]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using the fetch method, you can send files from the frontend to your Node.js backend for processing. Here's a simple example:
1. Backend (Node.js with Express & Multer)
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: './uploads/',
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, file.originalname);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'File uploaded successfully', filename: req.file.filename });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

2. Frontend (Using fetch to Upload File)
<input type="file" id="fileInput">
<button onclick="uploadFile()">Upload</button>

<script>
function uploadFile() {
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    const file = fileInput.files[0];

    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    fetch('http://localhost:3000/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
</script>


3. Running the Project
Open the HTML file in your browser, select a file, and click "Upload."
This will send the file to the backend using the fetch method and store it in the uploads directory.
