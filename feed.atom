I will not forget the fluid frame updates when I held down right arrow key. Those who consume lots of movies on Linux, might resonate with me.
Fast forward a year, I had to switch away from Linux, and move back to Windows on my laptop, and I had only one. But the memory of Celluloid struck with me, and I was no longer satisfied with VLC. I needed a better one, and I found one very close. It was called KM Player.
Time passed. Life was happy with KM Player. Then I got a job. And I forgot about leisure time, so I had not touched it for straight six  months. One day, as our team just delivered the project we were working on, we were granted 2 weeks of paid leave. That ni…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with ASP.NET Core Identity, a set of default tables is automatically created to manage user authentication, roles, claims, and more. These tables are essential for implementing secure and flexible identity management in your application. Here's a breakdown of what each table does:
AspNetUsers
UserName
Email
PasswordHash
PhoneNumber
SecurityStamp, etc.
Think of it as the main user profile table.
AspNetRoles
Each role is stored once and assigned a unique ID and name.
AspNetUserRoles
many-to-many relationship between users and roles.
If one user is both an Admin and a Moderator, this table will contain two entries for that user.
AspNetUserLogins
external login provider like:
Google
Facebook
Microsoft
Twitter, etc.
It includes the provider name, key, and associated user ID.
AspNetUserTokens
💾 Contains tokens related to a user such as:
Password reset tokens
Email confirmation tokens
Two-factor authentication tokens
This helps manage temporary access scenarios securely.
AspNetUserClaims
For example:
SubscriptionLevel = Premium
Department = HR
These claims are typically used for fine-grained authorization.
AspNetRoleClaims
📄 Similar to user claims but tied to roles instead.
Example:
✅ ASP.NET Core Identity Default Tables Summary



Table Name
Purpose




AspNetUsers
Stores user account info like username, email, password hash, etc.


AspNetRoles
Stores role definitions (e.g., Admin, User, Manager).


AspNetUserRoles
Maps users to roles (many-to-many relationship).


AspNetUserLogins
Stores login data from external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).


AspNetUserTokens
Stores tokens for things like password resets, email confirmations, etc.


AspNetUserClaims
Stores custom claims assigned directly to users.


AspNetRoleClaims
Stores claims assigned to roles (users get these claims via role membership).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Logical AND (&&) Operator:


The logical AND (&&) operator checks whether both operands are true. If both are true, the result is true. If any one or both operands are false, the result is false.
// Check if both conditions are true
let age = 20;
let idProof = true;

// Logical AND checks both conditions
if (age >= 18 && idProof) {
  console.log("Allowed"); 
} else {
  console.log("Not Allowed");  
}

Output:
Allowed
The logical OR (||) operator checks whether at least one of the operands is true. If either operand is true, the result is true. If both operands are false, the result is false.
// Check if at least one condition is true
let age = 16;
let hasGuardian = true;

// Logical OR checks if either condition is true
if (age >= 18 || hasGuardian) {
  console.log("Allowed");
} else {
  console.log("Not Allowed");
}

Output:
Allowed
TheparseInt method parses a value as a string and returns the first integer. It accepts a string argument and optional radix parameter, defining the numeral system base. This method is commonly used for converting string representations of numbers into integers.
Example:
The method takes two parameters: the string to be parsed and the radix (optional, default is 10).
2 = binary, 8 = octal, 10 = decimal, 16 = hexadecimal.

Syntax:
parseInt(Value, radix);
Parameters:
Value: This parameter contains a string that is converted to an integer.
    radix: This parameter represents the radix or base to be used and it is optional.
[Reference - geeksforgeeks]
JavaScript provides several ways to execute a block of code repeatedly. These are called looping statements.
Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Syntax: while (condition) { // code to execute }
Example:




     let i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
       console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
       i++;

Hey folks! 👋
I built an Email-based AI Assistant powered by FastAPI, Gemini, and Postmark. The assistant allows users to send an email and get an AI-generated response right in their inbox — just like magic 🪄.
Here’s the workflow in simple terms:
User sends an email ➝ Postmark receives it ➝ Webhook (FastAPI backend) is triggered ➝
Gemini processes the email ➝ Response is generated ➝
Reply is sent back to the user via Postmark


📧 Try it yourself:

“Explain Postmark in brief” and within 30–60 seconds, you’ll get an intelligent reply — straight to your inbox.
