This high-performance Rust HTTP framework fundamentally altered my view of web development. Here's a genuine account of my experience learning and using Hyperlane.
ctx Abstraction


When I first began using Hyperlane, I was immediately impressed by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. In other frameworks, I was accustomed to writing more verbose calls, such as:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

With Hyperlane, this simplifies to a single line:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

This design significantly boosts code readability, especially when handling complex business logic, by removing the need for deeply nested method calls.

Have you ever been at a networking event, recognized someone's face, but completely blanked on their name? It's happened to all of us! This common social challenge inspired me to build the Name Match Memory Game a simple but effective tool to help people practice connecting faces with names.
The idea was straightforward: create a game that shows users face images, presents multiple name options, and helps them practice making the right connections. What started as a simple command-line tool evolved into a full-fledged web application, all with the help of Amazon Q CLI.
Getting started with Amazon Q CLI on my Windows machine using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) took a bit of setup, but was worth the effort.
First, I needed to install the AWS CLI and configure it with my cr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I understand that AI is a cool thing. It's amazing how far AI has come in the last few years. It can give you delicious recipes using only the things you have at home, help you do research, take over your homework completely or explain things to you. And programming too, of course. Oh, and pictures and videos anyway.
Everyone wants a piece of the pie and AI is a huge pie. Just like crypto was huge a few years ago, AI is now the big buzzword that everyone is talking about faster than you know what.
And that already solves the mystery of why AI is used in every product, every advertisement and every application. It increases profit. But what should be much more important is whether it serves the product. Is AI being used sensibly? Does it bring added value? Using AI just for the sake of using it won't benefit anyone in the end. And I believe that the more technical the product, the better the customers know about technology and AI, the more obvious it becomes (hello Devin, you awesome software developer).
It's already been over 3 years. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, AI. There are more models than Javascript frameworks. Okay, maybe not yet, but soon. There are many cool products that use AI in a really creative and creative way. And this is just the beginning. There are still countless use cases, so many creative applications of AI that you can use in your product. Maybe your product doesn't need AI. But if you want a piece of the pie, if you want to ride the hype, if you want to sell better, then use AI. But find a way to use it in a way that makes sense for you. Ask AI how you can best incorporate it into your product. That really works.
AI is cool. AI is new. AI is everywhere. Sometimes a bit overhyped. But I think one thing is pretty certain. We will never live without AI again. So it would probably be better to understand it better and how we can best use it. It's not a buzzword. It's not hype. But an opportunity.]]></summary>
