Whether you’re at a fork in the road or just getting curious, this series is for you. Week 1 will be about exploring (experimentation, choosing a growth theme), Week 2 we'll focus on becoming visible and taking initiative, while the final week is about claiming growth (or moving away) and choosing your own path. Join me on this journey!
For a long time, I thought there were only two choices:
Stay technical: stay “just a dev”
Go into leadership: say goodbye to coding
But that is definitely not the case.
You can lead and still write code.

As discussed in Part 2, I designed the overall layout of the backend server by creating all the essential endpoints, connecting it to the frontend, and tested it using a mock database.
Now, it's time to transition to a real database. Why is a persistent database essential?
Manual Data Updates: With a mock database, data updates are manual and not persistent across sessions.
Scalability Limitations: In-memory arrays become inefficient and unmanageable with growing datasets.
Inefficient Authentication: Each login attempt requires iterating through the entire dataset, which is highly inefficient for real applications.

The error is:
This error happens even though I can physically see the logo.png file inside my app/res/drawable folder. The file name is all lowercase.
I am running Android Studio on a Windows machine. Here is everything I have already tried to fix this:
Verified Code: All my code (activity_main.xml, MainActivity.kt, build.gradle.kts, AndroidManifest.xml) is correct and synchronized.
Clean and Rebuild: I have used Build -> Clean Project and Build -> Rebuild Project many times. The build is successful, but the error appears when I try to run the app.
Invalidate Caches: I have used File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart multiple times.
Manual Deep Clean: I have closed the project, manually deleted the .gradle, .idea, and build folders from my project directory, and then re-opened the project to force a fresh sync.
Complete Reinstallation: I have completely uninstalled Android Studio from my computer, deleted all related settings files, and then performed a fresh, clean installation. I created a brand new project from scratch, and the same error still occurs.
Windows Features: I have enabled both Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Hypervisor Platform and restarted my computer.
Conclusion: The problem seems to be a deep environmental issue on my computer where the Android build tools (AAPT) cannot see or access the resource files, even when they definitely exist. I am out of ideas. Has anyone ever seen this kind of persistent error before?]]></summary>
