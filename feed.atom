In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. 
“OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said.

Understanding Firebase Initialization Issues
When developing applications for both Android and web using Flutter, it's crucial to initialize Firebase correctly. The initialization process requires platform-specific configurations. When you use FirebaseOptions() for web, it requires specific parameters: apiKey, appId, messagingSenderId, and projectId. However, when you comment out this config…]]></summary>

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As your application grows, it's common to see controllers doing too much — saving data, sending emails, updating reports… all in the same place. That makes your code harder to maintain and reuse.
A simple and powerful way to fix this is by using Events and Listeners in Laravel.
Events allow you to decouple secondary actions from your main logic. Instead of calling everything derectly in the controller, you trigger an event, and listeners handle the rest.
php artisan make:event OrderPlaced
php artisan make:listener SendConfirmationEmail

Laravel will create two classes: one for the event and one for the listener.
class OrderPlaced
{
    public function __construct(
        public Order $order
    ) {}
}

class SendConfirmationEmail
{
    public function handle(OrderPlaced $event)
    {
        Mail::to($event->order->customer->email)
            ->send(new OrderConfirmationEmail($event->order));
    }
}

Inside a controller or service:
event(new OrderPlaced($order));

Decoupling: each listener does only one job.


Reusability: you can reuse listeners in different places.


Scalability: add new listeners without changing existing code.







  
  
  Bonus: Async Events


If you want the listener to run in the background (for example, to send emails or make API calls):
class SendConfirmationEmail implements ShouldQueue
{
    use InteractsWithQueue, Queueable;
}

Using Event Listeners in Laravel is a great way to keep your code clean, organized, and scalable. Start with simple use cases like sending emails or logging, and grow from there.
Are you already using events in your Laravel projects? What’s the biggest benefit you’ve seen?]]></summary>

In today’s fast-paced JavaScript ecosystem, staying updated isn’t just a nice-to-have—it’s essential. One of the biggest shifts is the continued rise of TypeScript, now widely adopted for its type safety and improved developer productivity. If you’re not using it yet, it’s worth exploring.
Frameworks like React and Vue continue to evolve rapidly. React’s Server Components and Vue 3’s Composition API are enabling cleaner, more modular architectures—pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in front-end development.
Meanwhile, serverless architectures are gaining traction. Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and AWS Lambda are making it easier than ever to deploy scalable, event-driven applications without managing infrastructure.
Whether you're a full-stack developer or tech decision maker, keeping pace with these trends helps you build better, faster, and more future-proof apps. What tools or trends are you currently exploring? Let's discuss!

Understanding the Lua Class Structure
Before diving into the specifics of the function call in question, let's review the provided Lua code:
cc = {calo = 0, goal = 1500}
function cc:new(t)

Let me start with a small note. I’m very happy we didn’t jump into the implementation of the server right from the beginning. By first building out modules like the configuration parser and the HTTP request parser, we now have a solid foundation that we can rely on — and that allows us to focus this part purely on the server logic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Você já digitou algo em um campo de busca e, a cada letra digitada, uma nova requisição era feita para a API?
Isso é ineficiente.

A solução? debounce()
debounce?


É uma técnica usada para adiar a execução de uma função até que um tempo específico tenha passado sem novas chamadas.
É muito usado em:
buscas dinâmicas (auto-complete)
eventos de rolagem (scroll)
eventos de resize
Imagine um campo de busca que chama a API a cada tecla:
function search(term) {
  fetch(`https://api.exemplo.com/search?q=${term}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log);
}

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  search(e.target.value);
});

Isso gera chamadas demais.
Agora, com debounce:
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500);

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});

Agora só é chamada a API depois que o usuário parar de digitar por 500ms.
No React, pode usar com useCallback ou bibliotecas como lodash.debounce:
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const debounced = useCallback(
  debounce((value) => {
    // chamada de API aqui
  }, 300),
  []
);

This can cause errors as certain DB2 versions don't support those casts. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide solutions to remove the cast statements for compatibility with DB2 z/OS.
Understanding the Problem
In Hibernate, SQL query generation can change between versions due to changes in how Hibernate handles type conversions. After upgrading to Hibernate 6, many users report encountering errors like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States Department of the Treasury has sanctioned a Myanmar militia group known as the Karen National Army (KNA), accusing it of crypto-related scams and other criminal activities. 
According to a May 5 press release issued by the agency, the Karen National Army has been orchestrating a variety of crypto scams, including the infamous “pig butchering” scam, which lures victims into contributing more and more to fake crypto schemes. Americans “have collectively lost billions of dollars” from scams such as those emanating from Myanmar, the release reads, without specifying an amount.
“Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the Karen National Army (KNA), a militia group in Burma, as a transnational criminal organization, along …]]></summary>

The ETF is designed to accumulate spot BNB (BNB) tokens and “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the [fund’s] assets through one or more trusted staking providers,” according to the ETF’s S-1 prospectus. The filing marks the first time an asset manager has filed for a BNB ETF in the United States.
The BNB token has a market capitalization of roughly $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. As of May 5, BNB stakers earn a yield of approximately 2.5%, according to data from Stakingrewards.com.

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its late 2024 rally, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line.

In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that Web2.5 platforms are earning “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications, in particular, are thriving in the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications avoid full decentralization, often drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.

The Indonesian Ministry of Communications and Digital (Komdigi) has halted the Electronic System Operator Certificate Registration (TDPSE) for World and World ID over suspicious activity and alleged registration violations, the ministry announced on May 4.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notcoin, one of the most prominent Web3 gaming projects of 2024, said the tap-to-earn genre is “probably dead” as Web3 gaming shifts to more fun and engaging projects.
During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market. 
Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption.
