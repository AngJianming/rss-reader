        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introdução.
wget é uma ferramenta de linha de comando usada para baixar arquivos da internet via HTTP, HTTPS ou FTP. Ele é muito útil para automatizar downloads ou para baixar arquivos em servidores sem interface gráfica.
As principais características do wget são:
Funciona diretamente no terminal.
Pode baixar arquivos de uma URL específica.
Suporta downloads recursivos, ou seja, pode baixar páginas e todos os arquivos relacionados.
Permite retomar downloads interrompidos com a opção -c.
Ideal para scripts automáticos de atualização ou backup.
Veja abaixo as opções mais usadas do comando wget:
O wget sem parâmetros, apenas baixa o arquivo:
wget https://exemplo.com/arquivo.zip
Utilize wget -O para baixar um arquivo e salvar com um nome diferente:

What does that mean though? Basically we have a possibly growing amount of declarative HTML that can add interactivity, without javascript 🤯
If you're a old and kind of clever like me this might trigger happy memories of the <marquee>Do you believe in love after love</marquee>
element
HTML attributes

and an example from MDN
<button commandfor="mydialog" command="show-modal">Show modal dialog</button>
<dialog id="mydialog">
  <button commandfor="mydialog" command="close">Close</button>
  Dialog Content
</dialog>

So what's interesting about the above example, at least to me is it actually runs with javascript disabled!?! So only built in the browser commands will work, but I think this is cool. Really primitive elements that add a better UX to the user can now run in environments without javascript. Also this pattern has better Accessibility out of the box.
You can also write your own custom js events and handlers...
Creating custom commands
```Rotate left

myImg.addEventListener("command", (event) => {




I'm not 100% overall on how I feel about that though, maybe it helps lower level with creating interactive elements... Maybe it feels like too little too late, time will tell.]]></summary>

In Flutter, if you encounter the error message Please provide ShowCaseView context while using the ShowcaseView widget, you are not alone. I have read extensive documentation and community forums, including Stack Overflow, but still couldn't resolve this issue. This article will guide you through understanding why this happens and how to fix it effectively when integrating the showcaseview and persistent_bottom_nav_bar_v2 packages in Flutter.
When you implement the ShowCaseWidget, it's essential to ensure that the context is correctly provided to the widget. Given a scenario where you want to showcase some features in a BottomNavigationBar, this error could pop up if the ShowCaseWidget isn't wrapped properly, or the context is not available at the calling point.

  Evolution of Speech Recognition Technologies


The journey of speech recognition technology started as early as the 1950s, predominantly focusing on isolated word recognition. Early systems, such as IBM's "Shoebox," recognized a mere 16 words. The evolution accelerated with the advent of hidden Markov models (HMM) in the 1980s, which allowed for continuous speech recognition. The 1990s saw the introduction of statistically based systems, leveraging vast amounts of data to improve accuracy.
Fast forward to the 21st century, we witness the proliferation of deep learning techniques, particularly the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural n…]]></summary>

In this class, total_car is used as a class variable to keep track of the total number of cars. It is shared across all instances of the class.
Although total_car should be accessed using the class name (e.g., Car.total_car), it is technically possible to access or even assign it through an instance (e.g., tata.total_car).
However, if you assign a value to total_car using an instance (like tata.total_car = 5), it doesn't modify the shared class variable. Instead, it creates a new instance variable named total_car, shadowing the class variable. This can lead to unexpected or incorrect behavior, often referred to as a "garbage value" in this context.]]></summary>

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC).
The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities — a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. 
Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war che…]]></summary>

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.

Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds.

Line users will be able to use USDt for in-app payments, cross-border transfers and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.
