These events are not merely exercises in presenting financial data; they help build foundational skills that can be important in various finance roles, including those on Wall Street. While the connection between performing well in these competitions and securing a job in investment banking, equity research, or asset management is not direct or immediate, there are several ways in which the experience can shape a professional path toward these roles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A dynamic list updates based on user actions like adding, removing, or editing items. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a dynamic list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
A code editor (like VS Code)
A browser for testing
Create a basic HTML file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Dynamic List</title>
  <style>
    ul {
      padding-left: 20px;
    }
    li {
      margin-bottom: 5px;
    }
    button {
      margin-left: 10px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h2>Dynamic List</h2>
  <input type="text" id="itemInput" placeholder="Enter item">
  <button onclick="addItem()">Add</button>

  <ul id="itemList"></ul>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


Create a file named script.js and add the following code:
function addItem() {
  const input = document.getElementById('itemInput');
  const value = input.value.trim();

  if (value === '') return;

  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = value;

  const removeBtn = document.createElement('button');
  removeBtn.textContent = 'Remove';
  removeBtn.onclick = function () {
    li.remove();
  };

  li.appendChild(removeBtn);
  document.getElementById('itemList').appendChild(li);

  input.value = '';
  input.focus();
}


How It Works?
The user types a value in the input field.
When the Add button is clicked, addItem() runs.
It creates a new 
 with the input text and a "Remove" button.
Clicking "Remove" deletes that item.
Here is the full example in JSFiddle.
You now have a simple dynamic list using JavaScript. You can improve it by saving items to localStorage, adding edit buttons, or using frameworks like React for complex UIs.]]></summary>

“It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on May 13, adding that stablecoins are especially urgent because the country has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.”

In recent years it's been hard to keep up with the deluge of new models, capabilities, and tools. At the moment there are perhaps fewer brighter rising stars than a pair of new open standards for AI development.
In this article we'll introduce and explore the concepts of model context protocol (MCP) servers and the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, compare and contrast the two approaches, and help you determine what's right for you and your team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When performing arithmetic with unsigned types in C++, especially with types like std::uint8_t, it's common to encounter questions surrounding modular arithmetic behavior. Specifically, many developers wonder if they can detect when a subtraction operation underflows (i.e., wraps around) without explicitly comparing the two operands.
Understanding Subtraction with Unsigned Types
In C++, when subtracting one unsigned integer from another, the result is constrained within the limits of the type. For std::uint8_t, this means that values wrap around when the result would go below zero. For example, subtracting 5 from 3 results in 254 due to the wrapping behavior inherent in unsigned types.
To validate whether an underflow occurred during subtraction, comparisons are typically used. However, th…]]></summary>

It allows you to ask one question to multiple LLM web interfaces at once and see all the returned answers in one place. If you hate tabbing through multiple browser tabs to ask multiple LLM's the same question, this project is the antidote for that.
It is using JavaScript to inject the global user prompt into the HTML DOM bodies of the individual browser views, which contain the webpages of the different LLM's. When the user clicks Ctrl + Enter, a message is sent to the main app which tells the individual pages to programmatically click the "send" button. The communication using IPC is also happening when the user tries to add more LLM browser views to the main view.
The challenging part for me was to come up with the code for allowing the individual LLM websites to detect user input and the clicking of the send button. As it turns out, each major LLM providers often change the makeup of the HTML bodies for some reason, causing the code to break. But so far, the fixes have been manageable.
Key features:
• Starts with a default of Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Gemini, with the option to add more LLM's like Grok, Claude, and DeepSeek.
• Responsive, keyboard-friendly interface.
Feedback is welcome here, on GitHub: Project Link

Not because of the tool itself, but because it demonstrated three things:
I could understand a product’s documentation

I could configure and troubleshoot a live integration

I could think like a developer and a user
That’s when I realized: learning to use a tool well is a project.

Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. 

Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.

Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.

Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …]]></summary>

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …]]></summary>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said.

He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original.

In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
