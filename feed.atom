In the past few weeks, Microsoft introduced NLweb—a natural language interface for navigating the web. Google I/O dropped bombs with new Gemini-powered AI tools and integrated AI agents in every corner of their ecosystem. GitHub Copilot is now free for more developers. Sora is making a video from text. Open-source AI is exploding. And everywhere, creators, coders, and designers are asking the same questions. question:
What’s going on? Is this the end of creativity as we know it—or a new beginning?
Microsoft NLweb turns websites into readable, interactive assistants.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a programmer for many years, I admit I'm no where close to the best, but I kept plugging away and did accomplish some things that made people more productive, and maybe less frustrated.
Along the way I learned that I needed to set limits on my boss, whoever they were at the time. Let me explain. 
One time the IT director told me I had gotten a bad review from a primary stakeholder. 'Never completed a project' I thought things were going along quite well, so how did that happen?
This 'primary stakeholder' was always moving the end goal, or adding to the list of functions. Therefore, I was never finishing or reaching the end.
From then on I needed a protection against bad reviews. No one had told me before that I needed a contract for work accomplished. I started writing up a project plan and had the stakeholder sign off, before work started, and when completed. Then they could add or change anything they liked. Only they first needed to acknowledge that this task was completed.
That put an end to bad the reviews, and made everyone happier, especially me. :-)]]></summary>

In the digital age, user feedback is gold.
Whether you're building a SaaS product, running a blog, or launching a mobile app — understanding your users helps shape better experiences. But traditional feedback systems often involve:
Managing EC2 instances
Scaling backend services
Writing complex logic for real-time updates
This can be costly, time-consuming, and a real dev productivity killer.
What if you could:
Collect real-time feedback through a REST API?
Instantly update ratings and analytics as new data arrives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[JavaScript has long been the dominant language of the web. However, as applications have grown in complexity, developers have increasingly turned to TypeScript — a statically typed superset of JavaScript — to gain better tooling, improved readability, and fewer runtime errors. In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into TypeScript, exploring its features, benefits, and how to get started.
What is TypeScript?
Key Features of TypeScript
Static Typing
TypeScript introduces types to JavaScript. This means you can specify the type of a variable, function parameter, or return value, which helps catch type-related bugs early in the development process.

So… today it happened again.
That same overwhelming-but-somehow-motivating thought that hits when you're deep into a scroll spiral you didn’t plan.
I was on LinkedIn, just looking. But suddenly, it turned into a stress bomb:
Layoffs.
Hiring freezes.
And every third post? “Just landed a 20 LPA package!” 😵‍💫
And there I was—coffee in hand, halfway through some DSA in Java, balancing a React internship, and just sitting there thinking:
“Why am I even doing this? Is there even a point anymore?”
It felt like the whole software world was overbooked. Web dev? Saturated.
Jobs? Slowing down.
So I did what most of us do.
I closed LinkedIn.
Instagram.
Insta was the usual escape:
Beautiful creators.
Dancers.
Actors lip-syncing.
People going viral in a flash.

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.
Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. 
Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.…]]></summary>

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $4,000.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish
Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s (ETH) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6.

On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.
Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…]]></summary>

Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Singapore-based artificial intelligence firm Genius Group has added more Bitcoin to its corporate treasury after being temporarily banned from doing so.
In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals. It follows Genius Group being temporarily barred from expanding its Bitcoin treasury after a US court order had banned it from selling shares, raising funds and using investor funds to buy more BTC.
Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.

In an X post, Zhao criticized the publication’s portrayal of his alleged involvement with World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance project backed by a business entity affiliated with US President Donald Trump. Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.
Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips.

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks
This is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significa…]]></summary>

Other financial institutions linked to the potential stablecoin include Early Warning Services, the parent company of digital payments network Zelle, and the payment network Clearing House.
The discussions are still in the early stages, and a final decision on the project could change depending on the regulatory environment and the demand for stablecoins.

The malware replaces the legitimate Ledger Live app on victims’ devices and then prompts the user to input their seed phrase through a phony pop-up message, a team from Moonlock said in a May 22 report.
“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.
“Now, within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” it added.
