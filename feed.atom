In the first post of this series, we explored what AG-2 is and how it works under the hood. Now it’s time to get hands-on: we’re going to install AG-2 locally and build your first functional agent — a small but powerful assistant that can answer questions using a tool.
To follow along, you’ll need:
Python 3.10+
pip
Basic terminal/command line knowledge
An OpenAI API key (for using LLMs)
Optional (but recommended):
A virtual environment (e.g., venv, conda)
Let’s get AG-2 up and running. In your terminal:
pip install ag2

Or, if you prefer to use the latest development version:
pip install git+https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2.git

Once installed, you can verify it works:
ag2 --version

Now let’s create a simple question-answering agent.
Create a file called basic_agent.py:

“You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.
Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineer…]]></summary>

But as we recently faced during a deployment, there's a lot more to it than convenience — especially when dealing with sensitive customer data, automated journeys, and communication tools like Customer Insights.
Here’s a breakdown of the real implications, pros and cons, and recommendations when considering copying production data into lower environments.
Need to replicate edge-case bugs tied to real records
Want to validate complex journeys or flows with accurate datasets

At the end of the Codecademy equivalent of CS1, students are asked to design and program a command-line game from the ground up. I considered a simple snippet of an RPG (fighting enemies in a forest until your party comes across a dragon), a chess simulator, or a blackjack simulator. I decided to go with the last one due to my limited experience and ability, as I felt the other two, while they interest me, would require too much time while my health is still recovering.

The program aims to be a robust and customizeable blackjack simulator, allowing for a variety of house rules, table rules, and personal preference. The program is even capable of handling changes to the deck or how blackjack is played with minimal code changes. By default, the game is single-deck blackjack with a maximum of 1 split, with surrenders allowed. If you're interested, you can find it here.
This project was a lot more difficult and took longer than I thought it would, but that was mainly down to my inexperience. I learned quite a lot when writing this program, and I am looking forward to improving the program as I learn, as well as tackling future projects. They will be much more challenging, I'm sure, but I am more prepared for them now than I was before I started this project.]]></summary>

Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:

This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents.
Hackers targeting centralized entities have a "massive" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.

Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.
