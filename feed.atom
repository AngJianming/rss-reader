        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Term
Explanation




PL/SQL
Procedural Language extension of SQL used in Oracle databases. It adds procedural features like variables, loops, and conditions to SQL.


Block
The basic unit of a PL/SQL program. Every PL/SQL code is written in blocks (anonymous or named).


DECLARE
Section to declare variables, constants, cursors, and exceptions (optional).


BEGIN
Mandatory section where the actual executable code (SQL & PL/SQL statements) is written.


EXCEPTION
Optional section to handle runtime errors (exceptions).


END
Marks the end of the PL/SQL block.


Variable
A placeholder to store data temporarily during program execution.


Constant
A variable whose value cannot be changed once initialized.


Cursor
Used to retrieve multiple rows from a SELECT query, row-by-row.


Loop
Allows repeated execution of a block of code.


IF-THEN-ELSE
Conditional statement to perform different actions based on conditions.


Procedure
A named PL/SQL block that performs a task.


Function
Similar to a procedure, but it returns a value.


Trigger
A PL/SQL block that executes automatically in response to an event (e.g., insert, update).


Exception
Error condition during execution (e.g., NO_DATA_FOUND, TOO_MANY_ROWS).



Basic syntax:
DECLARE
   -- Variable declarations
   variable_name datatype;
BEGIN
   -- Executable statements
   -- SQL and PL/SQL code goes here
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello PL/SQL!');
EXCEPTION
   -- Exception handling
   WHEN OTHERS THEN
     DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred.');
END;

To manage a multi-tenant panel, you can follow this article. This guide builds upon that configuration.
In your Entity model (which represents a tenant for this article), define methods to retrieve the logo and colors dynamically (To simplify, we define only the primary color instead of a full color set):

The idea of that project was to check how a fully serverless application would look, and where it would stand when choosing an architecture for other projects. 
For this project, I decided to go with a fairly simple but powerful set of tools: Serverless Framework, NodeJS, MongoDB running on Atlas, API Gateway for the endpoints, and AWS SNS for events. While the app itself centered around evaluating NFL draft prospects, the real learning came from designing and evolving the architecture.

Introduction:
Effective user and group management is crucial for securing and organizing a Linux system.  This involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts and groups, assigning permissions, and managing their access to system resources.  Linux provides powerful command-line tools to accomplish these tasks efficiently.
Prerequisites:
To manage users and groups, you'll need root privileges (typically using sudo).  A basic understanding of the Linux command line is also helpful.
Advantages:
Proper user and group management enhances system security by implementing the principle of least privilege.  It allows for granular control over access to files and directories, preventing unauthorized modifications or data breaches.  Organized user account…]]></summary>

Hibernate’s HQL is notably inadequate, making it difficult to implement dynamic column calculations and multi-layer associations. While JOOQ improves flexibility through its DSL, its grouping calculations require multi-layer nesting, leading to more verbose code than native SQL.
esProc SPL is like a “plug-in” for data computation! To write a multi-layer JOIN based on dynamic conditions, you had to use chain calls in Java for half an hour with JOOQ. Now you can implement this in just a few lines of SPL script, and its syntax is more intuitive than SQL. For example, calculating ‘top 3 sales by department’, which even requires nesting in SQL:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain gaming user activity dipped and funding slowed in April, but the overall ecosystem is healthier and maturing, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

Starknet said in a press release shared with Cointelegraph that it has hit “Stage 1” decentralization, according to a framework Buterin laid out in 2022, which means the network operates with limited oversight or “training wheels.”
Starknet added that the framework was the “gold standard onchain tool for analyzing Ethereum scaling solutions,” and said it achieved the milestone through changes such as creating a security council and censorship-avoidance mechanisms.

The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill, which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.

There hasn't been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deepfake-assisted hackers are now targeting US federal and state officials by masquerading as senior US officials in the latest brazen phishing campaign to steal sensitive data. 
The bad actors have been operating since April, using deepfake voice messages and text messages to masquerade as senior government officials and establish rapport with victims, the FBI said in a May 15 warning. 
“If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said.  
If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said. 
As part of these scams, the FBI says the hackers a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US federal prosecutors are pressing ahead with their case against Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm, but will drop a small part of their indictment after the Department of Justice rolled back its crypto enforcement last month.
Jay Clayton, the acting US Attorney for Manhattan, told federal court judge Katherine Polk Failla in a May 15 letter that the charges against Storm still stand, bar one part of a conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business charge.
“After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General,” Clayton wrote.

The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, liquidating all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. 
The more than 6 million IBIT shares are worth around $355.6 million at current prices.

Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[More than two-and-a-half years after filing for bankruptcy, cryptocurrency exchange FTX is moving forward with repaying users who have not had access to their funds.
In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Pampati said that “the whole world outside of the United States […] has already jumped onto this [stablecoins],” adding that “the US is [...] at the doorstep.” 
“I really think about new use cases that can emerge because of the borderless nature of stablecoins, because of the efficiency of the dollar onchain,” he said. “If you're trying to send money to your friend in Nigeria, why do you have to go through a bunch of hoops?”

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks.

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…]]></summary>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…]]></summary>

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.
