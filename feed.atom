The layoffs haven’t stopped. Projects are being killed mid-sprint. Startups are ghosting job offers. People are working more for less and wondering, “Why the hell am I still doing this?”
If you're burnt out, jaded, or secretly Googling “alternative careers for software developers”, you're not alone. But the real question is: should you actually quit tech?
Let’s break it down.
Burnout Isn’t Always About the Work


Sometimes it’s not coding that’s the problem - it’s everything around it.
Toxic team dynamics? Yeah, that’ll drain your soul faster than any bug in production.
Endless meetings? Welcome to death by calendar.
Poor leadership? Say goodbye to motivation.
Zero impact work? Even a great paycheck feels empty when you're just moving tick…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s fast-moving tech landscape, cloud adoption isn’t optional, it’s foundational.
Every week, we see headlines about major breaches, and more often than not, the root cause isn’t a failure of cloud technology, but a misstep in how it was configured or maintained.
Here’s the harsh truth:
Most cloud security failures stem from simple oversights, not sophisticated attacks.
So why does it happen?
What starts out as “temporary access for debugging” becomes permanent. A test database never gets encrypted. Firewall rules get opened in a rush to meet a deadline and never closed.
We’ve worked with companies across industries from fintech to gaming and we've noticed a recurring pattern:
Teams think they’re secure because they’ve “enabled encryption” or “set up IAM roles.”
But security is not a one-time setup. It’s an ongoing practice. A mindset. A framework.
Let’s walk through a few eye-opening examples:
•IAM Management: Are you reviewing and revoking stale access regularly?
•Monitoring: Do you have alerting for unusual activity like access from a new IP or a sudden spike in data transfer?
•Patching: Are your services and containers being scanned and patched automatically?
If even one of these makes you pause then your infrastructure might be more vulnerable than you think.
And here’s what’s worse:
We help growing businesses and modern DevOps teams design resilient, secure, and compliant cloud infrastructure. Whether you’re on AWS, Azure, or GCP we’ve put together a complete guide that covers:

But maintaining visual integrity through endless updates, design tweaks, and responsive changes is no easy feat. QA engineers often turn to visual testing to ensure nothing breaks visually after each deployment.
Yet, not all visual testing methods are created equal. Traditional pixel-by-pixel comparison may seem precise on paper, but it can cause more confusion than clarity. Minor anti-aliasing differences, font rendering changes across browsers, or even a slightly shifted shadow can throw up red flags—false ones. Visual regression testing takes a smarter route.
Instead of checking every pixel, it compares meaningful visual patterns, structure, and layouts-helping teams catch the bugs…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's fast-paced tech world, speed matters. But quality matters even more. No one wants to launch a product full of bugs or deliver a user experience that doesn't live up to expectations. That's where quality assurance (QA) comes in - not as a final check, but as an ongoing, strategic process that ensures everything runs smoothly from the start.
One of the biggest mistakes companies make is putting off QA until later. By then, fixing issues becomes expensive and time-consuming. A robust QA process starts right from the planning stage.
QA shouldn't be an island. Developers, designers, project managers, and QA engineers should work as a team. Communication is key. Clear documentation, shared expectations, and open feedback loops help avoid misunderstandings and missed bugs.
You can't fix what you don't track. That's why a well-defined test plan is essential. It sets expectations, outlines goals, and defines what success looks like.
Manual testing has its place, especially when it comes to exploratory testing or checking visual and UX elements. But automation is the backbone of a scalable QA process.
Smoke tests
Regression tests
API testing
Cross-browser checks
Tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright can help speed up the process. Don't overdo it with automation, though - maintaining flaky tests can slow down your team more than it helps.
Pro tip: CI/CD integration
Hook automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. That way, every time new code is pushed out, it's tested instantly. Faster feedback = fewer issues in production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omit and Pick are some of the most loved utility types in TypeScript. They let you create new types by excluding or selecting specific properties from an existing type.
union types, their behavior can be misleading - and in some cases, break your type expectations
type Employee = {
 id: string
 name: string
 job_name: string
}
type Customer = {
 id: string
 name: string
 company: string
}
type Person = Employee | Customer

❌ Problem: Using Omit Directly
type PersonWithoutId = Omit<Person, 'id'>

🧨 Actual Result:
type PersonWithoutId = {
 name: string
}

Only name survives. The fields job_name and company are lost.
Why?
not distributive over union types. It collapses the union into a common structure, then removes the property - resulting in a simplified, lossy type.
✅ Solution:
DistributiveOmit
We can fix this by explicitly distributing Omit across each union member:
type DistributiveOmit<T, K extends PropertyKey> = T extends any
 ? Omit<T, K>
 : never

type PersonWithoutId = DistributiveOmit<Person, 'id'>

✅ Expected Result:
type PersonWithoutId =
 | { name: string; job_name: string }
 | { name: string; company: string }

🧪 Same Fix for Pick
type DistributivePick<T, K extends keyof T> = T extends any
 ? Pick<T, K>
 : never

type BasicaPerson = DistributivePick<Person, 'id' | 'name'>

In modern web development, automating tasks can save time and reduce errors. If you're looking to dynamically import all images from a specific folder in a JavaScript project, especially in frameworks like Vue.js, you're in the right place!

Why This Issue Occurs
When you're dealing with a large number of images, maintaining and updating the image list in your code can become tedious. Manually adding image paths defeats the purpose of efficiency and can lead to mistakes. This need for automation becomes especially apparent when working with dynamically loaded content, where images are regularly updated.

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. 
The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.
“The Live Free or Die state is leading the way in forging the future of commerce and digital assets,” said New Hampshire Republicans in a May 6 X post.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. 
The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations.

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
