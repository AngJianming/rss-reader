In the part 1 of our series about how to develop, run and optimize Quarkus web application on AWS Lambda, we demonstrated how to write a sample application which uses the Quarkus framework, AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway and Amazon DynamoDB. We also made the first Lambda performance (cold and warm start time) measurements and observed quite a big cold start time. 
In the part 2 of the series, we introduced Lambda SnapStart and measured how its enabling reduces the Lambda cold start time by more than 50%. 
In the part 3 of the series, we introduced how to apply Lambda SnapStart priming techniques by starting with DynamoDB request priming with the goal to even further improve the performance of our Lambda functions. We saw that by doing this kind of priming by writing some add…]]></summary>

Over the past year, we've integrated with popular AI agents like GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit, and Greptile, giving us unprecedented visibility into how development teams are adopting and using these tools.
The insights we've gathered have been remarkable. Today, 85% of our paid customers actively use AI agents for code review, representing a fundamental shift in how development teams approach collaboration and quality assurance. But the real story isn't just in the adoption numbers—it's in what we've learned about how these tools are reshaping development workflows in ways we didn't anticipate.

Core Web Vitals are a set of user-centric metrics developed by Google to measure key aspects of web performance: loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. 
In 2025, the three main Core Web Vitals are:

Developers are building AI agents that can interact with GitHub, query databases, scrape websites, and integrate with dozens of other services - all through MCP servers. It's an exciting time, but there's a problem lurking beneath the surface.
Every time you run a third-party MCP server, you're executing someone else's code with access to your systems.
That innocent-looking command npx @modelcontextprotocol/your-cool-mcp-server isn't just downloading a package - it's executing someone else's code on your system, potentially giving a stranger access to your code, API keys, and other sensitive data.

Here’s what often goes wrong:
Pricing models are overly complicated or mismatched with customer expectations.
Product demos fail to highlight practical value, leaving prospects unconvinced.
Founders try to manage growth internally without niche expertise.
What these startups need is a stealthy growth partner — someone who understands the unique challenges of automation startups and works quietly behind the scenes to drive momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🚫 Problem: Big Bundles, Slow First Loads
Modern apps ship huge bundles. Tools like Vite and Webpack support code splitting, but it's often underused.
✅ Solution: Dynamic Import + React.lazy
Assume we have a heavy component:
export default function Chart() {
  // big lib like recharts, visx, or d3
  return <div>Heavy Chart</div>;
}

Instead of importing normally:
import Chart from "./Chart"
Use React.lazy:
const Chart = React.lazy(() => import(./Chart));
Wrap it with <suspense>:
📊 Result
Initial load time down ~40% on mobile
Less JS execution blocking Time to Interactive
Better Lighthouse scores
🧪 Vite Handle the Split
In Vite, you'll now see Chart.[hash].js as separate chunk. Automatically lazy-loaded when needed.
dist/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── main.[hash].js
│   └── Chart.[hash].js   ← ✅ Lazy-loaded!

🔧 Bonus Tips
Group multiple lazy components with import() + Promise.all

Always provide a <fallback> for UX
Profile with DevTools -> Network tab -> disable cache -> reload
🧠 Takeaway
If your app feels bloated - don't refactor the whole thing. Just start lazy-loading where it hurts most.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog guides you through simple steps on how to make Safari default browser. Setting Safari as your default browser on Mac, iPhone, and iPad ensures a seamless browsing experience across Apple devices, leveraging its speed, privacy features, and deep integration with the Apple ecosystem.
Safari comes as the pre-installed default browser on a new Mac. If you’ve switched to another browser by mistake or wish to revert to Safari, you can quickly and easily set it back as your default.
Let’s look at how to make Safari the default browser on your Mac system:
Step 1: Click the Apple icon on the top left and then System Settings (or System Preferences for older macOS versions).  

Step 2: Click Desktop & Dock > Default web browser.

Step 3: Click Safari from the dropdown menu.

Close the window. And now you are all set to use Safari as your default browser on your Mac system.
If you prefer shortcuts, you can use the Spotlight Search feature.
Here are the steps to use it:
Step 1: Press Command + Space key to open Spotlight Search box.

Step 2: Type “default web browser” and press Enter.

This navigates you directly to the System Settings, where you can choose Safari from the dropdown as explained before.
To make Safari your default browser on iPad/ iPhone, follow the same steps as shown below:
Note: For this tutorial, we are using the iPhone to illustrate the steps.
Step 1: Tap Settings on your iPhone/iPad device.

Step 2: Scroll down and tap on Safari.

Step 3: Tap on Default Browser App.

Step 4: Tap Safari to set it as your default browser.

Making Safari your default browser on Mac, iPhone, or iPad is a quick way to get a smoother and more secure browsing experience. It has privacy tools built right in, works great with your other Apple services, and it’s easy to set up. If you want to get the best browsing on your devices, Safari is a good choice.]]></summary>
