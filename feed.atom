Handling media uploads securely and efficiently is something developers can’t afford to get wrong, especially if their website relies heavily on user-generated content or dynamic media delivery. In Astro, this can be achieved through integration with a headless Digital Asset Manager (DAM) like Cloudinary. 
A DAM provides a centralized way to manage media assets like images, videos, and other rich media. With headless DAMs like Cloudinary, you can store, transform, and deliver media through APIs or SDKs, making them a good fit for Astro's component-based architecture. 
In this article, you’ll learn how to build a secure file upload system in Astro using Cloudinary’s SDKs and native integration. We'll cover how to handle uploads safely using Astro’s SSR mode while …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve probably used Webpack to bundle JavaScript, but what about images, fonts, and other static assets? In this article, we’ll explore how Webpack can manage those assets in a practical — and surprisingly elegant — way.

Imagine you're building an app full of images, icons, custom fonts, and PDFs. Without an organized strategy, your project can become messy. Webpack lets you import assets directly into your code, and it takes care of everything: renaming, compressing, placing files correctly, and more.
Node.js installed
Webpack and Webpack CLI
Basic JavaScript knowledge




npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

Webpack lets you import images like JS modules:
import logo from './images/logo.png';

const img = document.createElement('img');
img.src = logo;
document.body.appendChild(img);

Webpack copies the image to the build folder and updates the path automatically.
Since Webpack 5, there's no need for file-loader or url-loader. Use asset/resource, asset/inline, and asset:
{
  test: /\.(png|jpg|gif)$/i,
  type: 'asset/resource',
}

You can import fonts like this:
import './fonts/roboto.woff2';

And inline SVGs:
{
  test: /\.svg$/,
  type: 'asset/inline',
}

For files meant to be downloaded rather than displayed:
{
  test: /\.pdf$/,
  type: 'asset/resource'
}

For better cache management:
output: {
  filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
  assetModuleFilename: 'assets/[hash][ext][query]'
}

Webpack is more than a JS bundler. Using asset management wisely can make your project more organized, efficient, and professional. Start small — maybe with your logo — and gradually unlock the full power of this amazing tool.

As technology continues to evolve, so do the ways in which we secure our homes, businesses, and facilities. One of the most promising advancements in security and access control is the use of Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC allows users to access doors and gates without physical keys, providing a seamless and secure experience.
In this post, we’ll explore how NFC works for contactless door access, provide real-world use cases, and include some code examples to help you get started. We’ll also connect the topic to related industries, such as fencing and perimeter security, while respecting publication guidelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building modern, dynamic, and high-performance user interfaces (UI). It was developed by Facebook (now Meta) in 2013 and has since become the most widely used frontend library in the world.
One of React’s core strengths is its component-based architecture, which allows developers to break down the UI into reusable, manageable components. This leads to cleaner, more scalable code.
✨ Why Learn React.js?
✅ Fast, Dynamic, and Interactive UI: React utilizes a virtual DOM to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that have changed.
🔥 Why React.js is Essential to Learn in 2025

While my extroverted colleagues were leading daily standups with infectious energy and jumping into every technical discussion, I found myself hanging back, observing, and only speaking up when I felt I had something genuinely valuable to add.
Turns out, that wasn't a weakness at all.
Last weekend, I was watching my neighbor's golden retriever at the dog park. The owner wasn't hovering over the dog, calling out commands every few seconds. Instead, she sat on a bench, keeping one eye on her pet while chatting with other dog owners. But here's the thing she knew exactly when to intervene.
