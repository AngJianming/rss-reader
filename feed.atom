A. undefined

B. null

C. Se esperaba dos argumentos, pero se recibió uno

D. string 
Respuesta
  
✅  C. Se esperaba dos argumentos, pero se recibió uno
El parámetro singer tiene explícitamente la anotación de tipo string | undefined lo que significa que este parámetro no es opcional sino obligatorio. Es por este motivo que cuando llamamos a la función announceSongBy con solo un parámetro sistema de tipado de Typescript encuentra una inconsistencia y lanza una advertencia. 
Es importante notar que al momento de compilar este ejemplo, el código JavaScript resultante no presentara ninguna problema y mostrara por consola la cadena Greensleeves. Las advertencias que nos hace Typescript solo son útiles en el periodo de desarrollo.]]></summary>

If your site architecture includes multiple subdomains, especially those with more than one level (like dev.blog.example.com), figuring out the right SSL setup can get complicated.
Wildcard SSL certificates are often the first solution people turn to for subdomain coverage. They simplify certificate management and reduce costs, but they’re not a one-size-fits-all answer. When your domain structure starts getting deeper to multi-level, you need a more strategic approach.
A wildcard SSL certificate allows you to secure a main domain and all its subdomains with a single certificate. Instead of managing separate certs for blog.example.com, shop.example.com, …]]></summary>

As a tech enthusiast,I always wants to learn something new inorder to broaden my knowledge of emerging technology.Last month,I had an opportunity to attend a interview,and luckily,I got selected for the Final assesment phase,The company recommended to have a good grasp of Go(GoLang) before the assesment,so i decided to dive into it.
I began with the offical Go documentation, but I found it a bit overwhelming and wasn't sure where to start,so then I went to Youtube and searched for tutorials,After some time I discovered an exordinary playlist  by Mr.Hitesh Choudary that made Go Simple,Engaging,Practical.
👉 Go Playlist: Let's Go with GoLang by Hitesh Choudary
I'm truly grateful to Hitesh sir for providing such a beginner-friendly course.I provided hands-on experience while encouraging me to refer the Go official documentation alongside the videos.He covered almost every topic a beginner should know.
Basics and syntax of Go
Handling web requests
Creating REST APIs
Building servers (with and without databases)
Integrating with MongoDB
Using Go Modules (GoMod) to manage dependencies
Working with Goroutines for concurrency
Understanding Race Conditions, Mutex, Channels, and how Deadlocks occur
To track my progress and help others who are also learning, I’ve uploaded my practice code here:
👉 GitHub Repo – Learn_Go_Repo
Learning Go has really been a Great experience,and I'm excited to apply these concepts in real-world projects soon.
Thank you for Reading!🙌

If you're using Active Storage in your Ruby on Rails applications (and let's be honest, it's pretty awesome for handling file uploads!), you've probably experienced its power and simplicity. But have you ever wished you could easily see what's going on under the hood? Like, a proper dashboard to visualize your blobs, attachments, and overall storage usage?
I found myself wanting exactly that. Digging through the console or database to check on files, their metadata, or how much space they're consuming can be a bit tedious. That's why I built Active Storage Dashboard!

Active Storage Dashboard is a mountable Rails engine that provides a sleek, modern, and (dare I say) beautiful dashboard to monitor and inspect your Active Storage data. It's designed to be:

Why the confusion?

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based—Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett's exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain gaming user activity dipped and funding slowed in April, but the overall ecosystem is healthier and maturing, according to blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[US federal prosecutors are pressing ahead with their case against Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm, but will drop a small part of their indictment after the Department of Justice rolled back its crypto enforcement last month.
Jay Clayton, the acting US Attorney for Manhattan, told federal court judge Katherine Polk Failla in a May 15 letter that the charges against Storm still stand, bar one part of a conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business charge.
“After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General,” Clayton wrote.

The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, liquidating all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. 
The more than 6 million IBIT shares are worth around $355.6 million at current prices.

Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been “hiccups” in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. 
Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.
