Welcome back to Day 12 of this practical Linux challenge! Today is all about understanding processes, the moving parts of your Linux system. Understanding process management is a key part of ensuring applications and services remain stable and responsive, especially in production environments.
Whether you are deploying a web app or debugging a stuck background job, knowing how to inspect and control processes can save you hours.

A process is simply a running instance of a program or command. Every time you launch an app or command, Linux spins up a process for it, assigning it a unique PID (Process ID).

If so, you've probably encountered the challenge of managing two separate servers and making them work together smoothly.
In this post, I'll walk you through how StartER solves this problem with a "one server" approach that not only simplifies development but also enables powerful Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities.
When building a modern web application with React and Express, you typically have:
A Vite development server handling hot module replacement (HMR) and React-specific features
An Express backend server managing API routes and server-side logic
Managing these as separate servers creates unnecessary complexity:
You need proxy configurations

The primary concern here is whether you can utilize existing SQL schemas without having to regenerate them for the new WCF-SQL port.

Understanding the Transition to WCF-SQL
WCF-SQL provides a more flexible web service interface compared to traditional SQL send ports. While it offers enhanced functionality, such as support for multiple message formats and better error handling, transitioning requires careful attention to how schemas are managed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AWS無料枠を使ってハンズオンなど検証に利用されている方も多いのではないだろうか？
AWS無料枠は数多くのサービスに用意されているので、大変ありがたいのだが、無料枠が適用されない場合があるので注意が必要。
今回の場合は、VDIサービスのAmazon Workspacesで無料枠が適用されずに課金されたパターンについて紹介する。

Amazon Workspacesの料金表ページにある無料利用枠の説明には以下の記述がある。
WorkSpaces を使用する最初の 3 か月間は、時間単位での計測モードで動作する、80 GB のルートボリュームと 50 GB のユーザーボリュームを備えた 2 つの標準 Red Hat Enterprise Linux、Rocky Linux、Ubuntu、Windows、または Amazon Linux 仮想デスクトップバンドルの、1 か月あたり合計で最長 40 時間の使用。
今回Amazon Workspacesを利用したAWSアカウントは今までにWorkspaceは利用していなかったのだが、AWS Organizationsの子アカウントになっていたため、親アカウントでの利用履歴を元に課金対象になったものと考えられる。
※月額課金分の明細については、5日に起動したため、初月が日割りになっており、0.868Monthとなっている
なお、Amazon WorkSpaces Secure Browserの料金表ページの無料枠の説明には以下の注意書きがある。
このオファーは、すべての AWS アカウントを対象としていますが、これまでに同じアカウント内、またはその AWS Organization の別のメンバーアカウント内に存在する 1 名以上の WorkSpaces Secure Browser 月間アクティブユーザーについて料金を請求されたことがある場合を除きます。
ハンズオンなどで試す場合には、AWS Organizationsで子アカウントを払い出してハンズオンを実施し、終了後にアカウントごと削除するという運用を行なっている方は、子アカウントとして払出しをしないで、新規アカウントを発行して試すというのが良いと考えられる。
余談だが、Workspacesアカウントを発行した後に登録したメールアドレス宛にパスワード設定の案内が届くが、以下のようにエラーになってパスワードリセットできないことがある。この場合には、Directory Serviceから管理者による設定ができるので、同様のエラーになる場合には、試してみてほしい。]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model.[citation needed][1][2] Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).
Users access a database server either through a "front end" running on the user's computer – which displays requested data – or through the "back end", which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.
In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.
Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.
Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.
For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While many crypto ecosystems focus on decentralization as the core tenet of Web3, Aptos is seeing success with hybrid platforms that blend Web2 and Web3 technologies, commonly referred to as “Web2.5.”
In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that Web2.5 platforms are earning “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications, in particular, are thriving in the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications avoid full decentralization, often drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

BTC price needs to close above $95,000 on the daily chart for a push to $100,000.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price failed to break above resistance at $98,000 on May 3. Since April 22, BTC prices have formed daily candle highs between $93,000 and $97,900, but they could not close above $97,440.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

BTC price action attempts to hold the yearly open as support after some downside at the weekly close, but bullish perspectives remain intact.

The US Federal Reserve interest rate decision is the key macro event of the week, with Chair Jerome Powell tipped to “move markets.”

“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall …]]></summary>

Maldives signs $9 billion deal to become international crypto hub
The government of the Maldives signed a $9 billion deal with Dubai-based family office MBS Global Investments to develop a crypto hub in the island nation's capital of Malé and to attract foreign investment opportunities.
Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms.

According to a report by Le Monde, the May 3 raid resulted in five arrests. Local outlet Le Parisien also said the kidnappers demanded between 5 million and 7 million euros, or up to $7.9 million, to release the captive man.
Although the details on the identity of the victims remain scant, likely for security reasons, the crypto entrepreneur and his father co-owned a crypto marketing firm based in Malta, French media reports.
This incident features similarities to the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland in France in January 2025. Balland was also held for a crypto ransom until he was freed by …]]></summary>

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.
