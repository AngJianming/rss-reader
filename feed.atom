This may be a bit over-the-top, but to start my entry at World's Largest Hackathon by Bolt I'll actually build another entry to help me document my journey.
I've long been a fan of devlogs, videos or essays showing the work on a game, piece of art or software. The issue is I'm always a bit lazy to edit videos of my dev journey, so I never got around to creating them.
Instead, an idea has been circulating my mind for a while: what if dev logs were partially automated? I won't answer this question fully for now, but I'll take a stab at it with a first submission to the hackathon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CppCon 2024 was my first in-person conference — and it ended up being one of the most meaningful experiences in my career so far.
I didn’t just attend: I volunteered behind the scenes, gave a lightning talk, and connected with some amazing people in the C++ community. If you’ve ever considered attending CppCon, or want to do more than just sit in the audience, this post is for you.
CppCon isn’t just for language experts. It’s a welcoming space for learners, contributors, and quiet observers too. Here’s what made it special for me:
🌟 Volunteering gave me a peek behind the curtain and introduced me to people I wouldn’t have met otherwise.
🎤 Giving a lightning talk helped me push past hesitation and find my voice in front of a supportive crowd.
🤝 Networking events like the Women’s Lunch and Community Dinner offered real connections, not just business cards.
Submit something even if you’re unsure. A 5-minute talk can open doors and build confidence.
Say yes to volunteering. You learn, help others, and become part of the community fast.
Plan your schedule but allow for serendipity. Some of the best moments happen between sessions.
Join the Discord. Many friendships and insights start there before the conference even begins.
If you're curious about what the week looked like in detail — including anecdotes, reflections, and key sessions — check out my full trip report here:

Thanks for reading! If you're planning to attend this year and have questions, feel free to reach out. I’m happy to share what helped me feel less overwhelmed and more involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! 👋
Me and my friends — Abir, Siam, Rajib, Omair, and I (Mahmudul Haque Shawon) — are cooking up something exciting called Learner’s Pointer. It’s a platform designed specifically for Diploma in Engineering students to get better learning resources and connect with teachers and mentors.
Right now, I’m handling the backend with Django, building some cool features like:
Device-based login restriction — so a student can only be logged in on one device at a time. This helps keep things fair and prevents account sharing.
If someone logs in from another device, the previous session gets logged out automatically.
Secure password resets and soon, two-factor authentication!
Meanwhile, my buddy Abir is crafting the frontend using HTML and Tailwind CSS, making sure everything looks slick and works smoothly.
Our other friends — Siam, Rajib, and Omair — are helping with content, testing, and planning new features.
Our goal? To build a safe, easy-to-use space where diploma students can learn, share, and grow without distractions.
Stay tuned! More updates coming soon 🚀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial intelligence has long been promoted as the next frontier in drug discovery. It promised faster timelines, lower costs, and more precise targeting of disease. But recent updates from the field suggest that the reality is more complicated. Despite the billions invested, the AI drug discovery revolution is hitting the brakes, at least for now.
A new article published in Drug Target Review outlines a set of major challenges. AI models struggle to interpret complex biological systems, and there is still no standard process for validating or approving AI-generated drug candidates. The piece highlights that although AI can speed up discovery, it often underperforms when it comes to robustness, data integration, and real clinical translation.
You can read the full article here:
https://www.drugtargetreview.com/article/157270/navigating-the-ai-revolution-a-roadmap-for-pharmas-future/
Another recent paper published in Science takes a similarly measured tone. While it acknowledges the potential of AI in areas like molecular generation and structure prediction, it also points out that most applications remain in early stages. The authors argue that AI should support traditional workflows, not replace them, until more solid evidence of its impact emerges.
Read the Science article here:
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx0339
These are not failures. They are reminders that scientific progress moves step by step. AI will likely become essential to future drug pipelines, but the timeline may be longer and more incremental than early hype suggested.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here’s a simple and beginner-friendly blog post you can use for your learning blog on and (&&), or (||), and not (!) operators in JavaScript:
and, or, and not Operators in JavaScript


When we write conditions in JavaScript, we often need to combine multiple conditions or reverse a condition. This is where logical operators like &&, ||, and ! come into play. Today, I explored how these operators work and how they can be used effectively.
and Operator (&&)


The && operator returns true only if both conditions are true.
condition1 && condition2

let age = 25;
if (age > 18 && age < 30) {
  console.log("You are in your twenties!");
}

Here, both conditions must be true:
age > 18 ✔️
age < 30 ✔️
So, the message is logged ✅.
or Operator (||)


The || operator returns true if at least one of the conditions is true.
condition1 || condition2

let day = "Saturday";
if (day === "Saturday" || day === "Sunday") {
  console.log("It's the weekend!");
}

Either day === "Saturday" or day === "Sunday" is enough to log the message.
not Operator (!)


The ! operator is used to reverse a boolean value.
!condition

let isRaining = false;
if (!isRaining) {
  console.log("You can go for a walk.");
}

Since isRaining is false, !isRaining becomes true, so the message is logged ✅.



Operator
Meaning
Returns true if...






&&
AND

Both conditions are true




`

`
OR

At least one condition is true


!
NOT (negation)
The condition is false






&& = All must be true ✅✅
|| = At least one must be true ✅❌
! = Opposite of the condition ❌➡️✅
Try this in your browser console:
let isLoggedIn = true;
let isAdmin = false;

if (isLoggedIn && !isAdmin) {
  console.log("Welcome, user!");
}

Understanding these basic logical operators is essential for writing smart and readable JavaScript code. I enjoyed experimenting with these operators and now feel more confident using them in if statements and other logical conditions.
Happy coding! 🚀
