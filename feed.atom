Introduction
What is the gzip Command?
Core gzip Commands
Real-World Scenario: gzip Command
Conclusion
Let's Connect

Welcome back to Day 22 of this practical Linux challenge! Today, we are diving into one of the most useful Linux commands: gzip.
When you think of compressing any file, think of gzip

gzip Command?


gzip stands for GNU zip, a tool used to compress files, making them smaller and easier to store or transfer.

gzip Commands


More commonly used gzip command options are listed in the table below.




gzip Command
Description




gzip filename
Compress the file (creates filename.gz)


gunzip filename.gz
Decompress .gz file back to original


gzip -k filename
Compress file and keep original



gzip -r folder/
Recursively compress all files in a folder


gzip -d filename.gz
Same as gunzip, decompress file


gzip -v filename
Verbose mode ‚Äì shows compression info



Worthy to note that this command works only for files, not folders.

gzip Command



Select a file you wish to compress. Compress using the gzip command. It ends with .gz




gzip demologs.txt

ls -lh   # to confirm it compressed


Now you have seen how it works, let's decompress that .gz file back to the original format.




gunzip demologs.txt.gz 


If you notice when we compressed, it did not keep the original file. Now, let's keep the original file and the compressed file.




gzip -k demologs.txt

ls -lh   # to confirm both the original and compressed file are there



Learning gzip might seem simple, but it is a crucial skill in Linux.
Mastering it helps you maintain lean storage and improve transfer speeds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summary:
Both fetch and axios are used to make HTTP requests in JavaScript. While fetch is native and minimal, axios comes loaded with features. But when building production-grade applications, especially SPAs or SSR frameworks like Next.js, these differences matter ‚Äî a lot.
‚úÖ Fetch
fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Fetch error:', error));


Fetch does not throw on HTTP errors (like 404 or 500).
You must manually check response.ok or status codes.

axios.get('/api/data')

Why the Standard rand() Does Not Meet Your Needs
The rand() function is designed for simplicity and it typically returns a value in the range from 0 to RAND_MAX, which is defined in stdlib.h.

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The ‚Äúyield‚Äù is the annual return you‚Äôd get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It‚Äôs expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, ‚ÄúHey, lend me $1,000, and I‚Äôll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.‚Äù That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy.

A lag in Tether‚Äôs wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether‚Äôs address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
‚ÄúThis delay originates from Tether‚Äôs multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,‚Äú the report reads.
