Here‚Äôs a simple tutorial for making a basic Discord bot using Python. This bot will automatically reply with "very cool" whenever anyone sends a message in any text channel on your server.
It‚Äôs a great starting point if:
1:You‚Äôre learning how Discord bots work
2:You want to test basic features
3:You plan to build something bigger later
Let‚Äôs jump in.

# Create the bot client

The idea was to build a service with the following characteristics:
 DynamoDB-like API: Implementing the essentials from PutItem to TransactWriteItems.
 Robust Storage Layer: A RocksDB implementation with full transaction support.
 Modern Communication: High-performance gRPC service, Protocol Buffer serialization, and TLS 1.3 (including mutual authentication).

Microsoft Azure is one of the top cloud platforms today, offering flexible, scalable services for developers, engineers, and businesses. This blog breaks down the core architectural components that power solutions in Azure ‚Äî from regions to compute, identity, and monitoring.
Azure divides the globe into regions, which are collections of datacenters. Each region may have multiple availability zones, offering redundancy.
üìç Use Case: Deploying a mission-critical app? Use Availability Zones for high availability.

All Azure resources (VMs, databases, etc.) are organized in resource groups. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) lets you manage them as a unit using templates or code.

Easy grouping for billing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn‚Äôt considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin‚Äôs 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin‚Äôs 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period.

The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim‚Äôs wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as ‚Äúsecurity through obsc‚Ä¶]]></summary>
