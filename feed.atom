        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a junior computer science student, I was working on a campus second-hand trading platform project last semester when I stumbled upon the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework— it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!
When I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane’s Context (or ctx for short). I remember the first time I wanted to get the request method. In traditional Rust HTTP frameworks, I would have to write:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method(…]]></summary>

This high-performance Rust HTTP framework completely changed my perception of Web development. Below is my true experience of learning and applying Hyperlane.
When I first started using Hyperlane, I was pleasantly surprised by its clean Context (ctx) abstraction. Previously, in other frameworks, I had to write verbose calls like:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

Now, it’s as simple as one line of code:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

This design significantly enhances the readability of my code, especially when dealing with complex business logic, eliminating the need for nested method calls.
When implementing RESTful APIs, Hyperlane…]]></summary>

When you work with modern frameworks, the first question that comes up is the size of the bundle you generate. 
Yes, of course not first and foremost, but the client doesn't care how the developers do the project. He wants the site to load quickly!
So, in this article I would like to look at a small template language that will help you make the same application, but with much less effort.
Well, let's see what this project is 🔎
We'll take a specific application on Next.js and HMPL.js and see how much it will weigh in the end.

This build is 10x smaller than the Next.js build. Moreover, we keep the interface in its original form, without losing any advantages (except for indexing by robots).

His message is clear: the future remains fundamentally API-driven, even as AI agents reshape how we interact with digital services.

So, what if we told you that a self-hosted WAF can offer similar—if not more flexible—identity authentication capabilities, completely for free?
SafeLine is a powerful, self-hosted WAF that not only protects your applications from common web threats like SQL injection, XSS, and bots—it also comes with a built-in identity authentication system, a feature rarely seen in open-source or self-hosted solutions.
And the best part? It’s completely free.

Today I will try to explain generators in a simple and beginner-friendly way.
Essentially, generator objects are useful when we want to iterate through some kind of sequence but we don't want (or can't) load it directly in memory (e.g using a list).
Think of a group of buildings in a big city. We want to find the first building that has an underground parking lot.
The size of the list can be interpreted as the system's memory, and in this way we see that generator objects can help us to reduce memory usage in iterating processes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The days of developers being siloed in tech-only teams are over. In 2025, some of the most exciting and impactful work is happening where tech meets everything else — healthcare, education, finance, art, logistics, even agriculture.
In this post, I’ll share why cross-industry work is gaining momentum, what it means for us as devs, and what to expect when you’re coding for fields far outside the traditional tech bubble.
🌍 Why Cross-Industry Projects Are Booming
What’s driving the shift:
AI and automation becoming mainstream across non-tech fields
Increased demand for custom tools, not just off-the-shelf solutions
Rising pressure to innovate fast (especially Covid)
Web3, IoT, and data tools opening doors to new types of collaboration
As a dev, you’re no longer just building software — you’re solving business problems with experts from many fields.
🧠 What It Feels Like to Code with Non-Tech Teams
You’re not just in meetings with other developers or PMs — you might be working with doctors, educators, lawyers, or logistics experts. You’ll often be the one translating real-world needs into actual software.
That means:
You ask more questions (and different kinds of questions)
You explain tech in plain English (a lot)
You build tools that might look simple — but solve huge pain points
Sometimes, it’s messy. But it’s also incredibly rewarding.
And of course, learn, learn, and learn!
💡 Examples of Cross-Industry Innovation
Healthcare: Building AI tools to help diagnose diseases or manage patient data securely.
Education: Creating adaptive learning platforms for schools using AI + gamification.
Finance: Developing tools for underserved populations using blockchain and mobile-first design.
Art & Culture: Collaborating with creators on NFT galleries, digital exhibitions, or immersive experiences.
Logistics: Using IoT + data visualization to improve supply chains.
If you’re a developer in 2025 and you haven’t worked outside of “pure tech” yet — it’s worth exploring. Just for yourself.]]></summary>
