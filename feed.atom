Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

One target demands $116,000 next week, moving BTC/USD firmly out of its narrow range.

A quick dip before continuing higher is among the options for BTC price action into the new week.

Bitcoin (BTC) reduced volatility to a minimum into the May 18 weekly close as traders bet on a fresh breakout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, I recreated a recipe webpage design from Figma using only HTML and CSS.
It was my first time translating a design into code while ensuring semantic structure and responsive layout.
🛠️ What I Coded:

Live Demo: Link
GitHub Repo: Link
Built a responsive recipe webpage with clean layout and spacing.
Practiced margin and padding to visually separate sections properly.
Iterated from scratch for my second attempt (without referring back) to reinforce layout planning and semantic HTML skills.
📚 What I Learned:
Building from Figma to Code:


Semantic HTML:


Responsive Design:


CSS Layout First, Styling Second:


GitHub Pages Deployment:



A key lesson: assets must be inside the /docs folder — relative paths to folders outside of it won’t work. Took some time and debugging to realize that!
💭 Reflections:
This is just the start of my journey — each attempt is growth. If i want to improve fast, the only way is to iterate fast.
On my second try, I completed everything (including responsiveness) in about 2 hours, which I think is a good start for my learning journey. More practice is definitely needed. On to the next design!]]></summary>

I'm Buğra, a full-stack developer and CTO, and I've been working on a side project called Apixies.io. It's a collection of small, focused APIs designed to solve specific problems without unnecessary complexity.
Currently, Apixies.io offers endpoints like:
SSL Health Inspector: Check the SSL certificate status of any domain.
Security Headers Inspector: Analyze HTTP security headers for best practices.
Email Inspector: Validate and inspect email addresses for proper formatting and domain checks.
User Agent Inspector: Parse and identify details from user agent strings.
HTML to PDF Converter: Convert HTML content into PDF documents.
All APIs are free to use, require no authentication for testing, and come with generous rate limits during the beta period. You can explore the full documentation and try them out here: https://apixies.io
I'm looking to expand this toolbox and would love your input:
What micro APIs would be helpful in your projects?
How's the user experience? Any suggestions for improvement?
Would you be interested in collaborating to develop new APIs?
Feel free to share your thoughts or suggest new endpoints directly on the site. Let's build something useful together!
Thanks for checking it out!

Grecho is an asynchronous HTTP echo server written in Rust. It listens for incoming HTTP requests and responds with the same body, headers, and URI, making it an excellent tool for testing HTTP clients, proxies, and other networked applications.

So what actually separates a junior developer from a mid-level or senior engineer?

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[South Africa’s Garden Route, famed for its lush forests, expansive beaches and charming towns, has become a testbed for Bitcoin adoption.
From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”
For tourists, the benefits are immediate: no currency exchange hassles, no international card fees, and the ability to pay instantly and securely. For locals, Bitcoin (…]]></summary>

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time.
