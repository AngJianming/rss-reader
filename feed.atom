The S&P 500 is a stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 of the largest, publicly traded companies in the US, representing a broad measure of the overall US stock market.
Coinbase's inclusion in the S&P 500 should increase demand for its stock because index funds and exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 must buy COIN shares to mirror the index.
COIN shares immediately rose 8.8% to $225.4 in after-hours trading following the announcement, Google Finance data shows.

Observers in Laravel are used to listen for specific events on Eloquent models, such as creating, updating, and deleting records. The main advantage of using them is the ability to delegate the data handling logic to a dedicated class, keeping controllers and models leaner.
Imagine you need to perform an action every time a user is created. Instead of writing that logic directly in the controller or the model, you can use an Observer to ensure that the logic is isolated and easier to test.
Creating an Observer in Laravel is very simple. Let's take a look at a basic example of an Observer for a User model:
php artisan make:observer UserObserver --model=User

Open the App\Providers\EventServiceProvider file and register the observer:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm thinking about starting a podcast with @blumen where we interview a bunch of somewhat successful / living-their-livelihoods-off-of-music people we went to music school with, and see where they are today. Basically Celebrity Catch Up: Life After I Did That Thing but without the Celebrity and without The Thing. 😬
Typing it out now makes it seem like a pretty bad idea, but I think it could be good information gathering for anyone considering music school or working in music. Plus, it would be amusing for our little cohort of music school grads and a fun way for us to reconnect with some folks. 
According to music-colleges.com (lol), SUNY Fredonia's music program ranks at #276 (out of 1451 schools they evaluated, so technically in the 20%!!). I imagine a podcast like this about Julliard grads would be much more successful, but those people probably wouldn't have good advice or relatable stories for real, non-prodigious but competent musicians.
So far our initial brainstorm has us landing around:
30-45 min max
Asking people about:


What they studied
How much schooling they ended up getting
Their most memorable Fredonia experience
What they do now
Career highlights
Career lows
How much money they currently make (from music)
What their advice would be for anyone pursuing their current career, or the program they studied in school
Thoughts?]]></summary>

Bitcoin price saw profit booking near $105,819, signaling that bears remain active at higher levels.

Select altcoins have continued to move higher, indicating increased investor interest.  

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

In a May 12 press conference at Gracie Mansion, the the city’s official mayoral residence, Adams said June Ou, founder of financial services company Figure, and Richie Hecker, CEO of private equity firm Traction and Scale, would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts. He spoke of Ou and Hecker acting as advisers for New York City’s next steps in “economic development and opportunities to serve the public using digital assets.” 
“We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding:

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into th…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project’s CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 
He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That’s the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  
The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.
