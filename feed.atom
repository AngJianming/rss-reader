        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is often misunderstood by the general public, commonly reduced to stereotypes involving excessive hand washing or cleanliness. While these symptoms may be part of OCD, the reality of this complex mental health condition goes far beyond surface-level cleanliness. OCD is a serious and often debilitating disorder that affects millions worldwide, influencing thoughts, behaviors, and daily functioning in profound ways.
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed to reduce the distress caused by these thoughts. These obsessions and compulsions are intrusive, time-consuming, and interfere significantly with everyday life.

With the amount of AI generated crap out there along with the dynamic and ever evolving landscape of the web; even when I try watching videos on youtube leisurely it becomes a binging session with hard disciplined study following each video. After about a year of such binge sessions and learning new technologies and stacks I realised my YouTube watch later and favourites playlists contents have become textbooks in themselves. 
So here I am, a fullstack web dev trying to annotate my thoughts as I go along surfing the web on my learning journey. From Java to PHP and from react to htmx I’ll try to cover all kinds of content to learn and discover more and more about this strange world of web and leave no stone unturned. After 2 failed attempts at microblogging, this is gonna be a new take but with a twist. 
Concept - each post contains a video
I’m still working on the order of videos to cover. So stay tuned. The goal is to make 2 posts a week covering 2 elaborate videos. Feel free to follow me to get updates on upcoming posts and let’s begin the Dev Bytes!]]></summary>

Solana is one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms in the world — and in this article, we’ll break down what it is, why it’s different, and the core concepts that make it powerful. All explained in a clear, relatable, and builder-friendly way.
Solana is a high-performance blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and low transaction costs.
In simple terms, it’s like a super-fast, decentralized computer that anyone can use to build apps, launch tokens, create NFTs, or transfer money — without needing a central authority or third-party service.

That system you hacked together months ago to accept PayPal, then Stripe, then PagSeguro… each with their quirks, all tangled in code only you can understand — and just barely.
That night, while debugging why a PayPal change broke Stripe, you swear: never again.
If you’ve ever touched payment systems, you know how it starts:

function processPayment(data) {

In this article, I’ll walk you through how to use Postman—one of the most popular API testing frameworks—to create real-world API tests with practical examples and code.
🔹Why Use a Framework Like Postman?
Postman allows developers and QA engineers to:
Create and send HTTP requests to an API
Write automated test scripts in JavaScript
Organize requests into collections
Use environments and variables to test across stages (dev, staging, production)
It combines ease of use with powerful features for testing REST, GraphQL, and SOAP APIs.
