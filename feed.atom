As a transport company with years of on-ground experience, we saw a huge gap in how small businesses and individuals manage logistics in India — especially when it comes to real-time tracking, instant booking, and accessible information.
That’s why we built MITCO, a user-friendly mobile app (available on Apple App Store) that lets users book, track, and manage their transport needs in just a few taps.
In India, logistics services are often manual, opaque, and difficult to track. Customers and companies face challenges like:
No visibility on vehicle location

Manual booking and communication

No digital record of past deliveries

Delays without updates

✅ What MITCO Offers
We developed MITCO with simplicity and speed in mind:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yield-bearing stablecoins have soared to $11 billion in circulation, representing 4.5% of the total stablecoin market, a steep climb from just $1.5 billion and a 1% market share at the start of 2024.
One of the biggest winners is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

Here's a detailed, first-person account of what I learned, the trade-offs, and how I approached the problem for my own project.
pgvector is an open-source extension for PostgreSQL that lets you store and search vector data (like embeddings from machine learning models) right inside your existing database. In contrast, a dedicated vector database is built from the ground up for storing, indexing, and searching high-dimensional vectors at scale.
For me, pgvector was appealing because I already had a PostgreSQL database running my application. It's perfect if you want to:

on peut s'attendre à un fonctionnement classique d'exploitation de type buffer overflow.
C'est parti pour l'exploitation !


Dépassement de la mémoire

Dans un premier temps, nous allons essayer de faire crasher le binaire. Quand on exécute le binaire, une entrée nous est demandée, logiquement un espace est alloué dans la mémoire pour stocker votre input.

C'est parfait, une erreur de segmentation est retourné par notre binaire. Désormais, il faut déterminer la taille du tampon associé à notre entrée.

En utilisant le désassembleur IDA, on trouve une fonction intéressante qui fait un appel système vers /bin/bash.

C'est très intéressant celà va nous servir par la suite, on va donc chercher l'adresse de cette fonction dans la mémoire pour pouvoir l'utiliser par la suite.


Exploitation

Avec toutes ces informations, on va désormais pouvoir passer à l'exploitation. Tout d'abord, une petite mise en place de la stratégie s'impose:
On fait un dépassement de mémoire suite à une entrée de 40 caractères.
On appelle la fonction par son adresse afin que le registre EIP pointe dessus
On ouvre un shell et on affiche le flag
J'utilise le langage Python afin de pouvoir scripter ça rapidement et simplement.
import pwn
from pwn import *

cnx = remote("challenges1.france-cybersecuri[...].fr",4000)
address_func_shell = 0x00400676
"A"*40
#architecture 64bits little-endian

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve worked with Umbraco 10+ and the new Block Grid Editor you know how powerful, and sometimes complex it can be. Designed to give content editors more layout freedom it’s a flexible but developer centric tool. While it’s a step forward in structured content editing it still requires technical setup, configuration and often some custom code to make it shine.
At ByteEditor we asked ourselves: What if creating Umbraco pages felt like using a modern visual page builder — no code, just clicks?
The Block Grid Editor brought modular design to Umbraco, allowing developers to define reusable layouts and components. 
However:
Editors need training to understand how blocks behave.
Developers must configure Data Types, Element Types and custom styles.
Previewing changes in real-time is rarely possible.
The UX still relies heavily on nested interfaces, dropdowns and tabs.
We saw an opportunity to bridge the gap between dev flexibility and editor usability.
Our Solution: ByteEditor — A Visual, Drag-and-Drop Page Builder for Umbraco
ByteEditor is a visual layer that sits on top of Umbraco’s Block Grid Editor and renders it into a true drag-and-drop WYSIWYG experience. Here’s how:
✅ Real-Time Visual Editing
✅ No-Code Layout Control
✅ Custom Block Support
✅ Developer-Friendly Setup
We believe in a future where developers set up content structures once — and editors run with it confidently, without fear of “breaking something.”
By making Block Grid truly no-code for editors we:
Reduce training time for content teams
Eliminate back-and-forth between devs and marketers
Speed up time to publish
Make Umbraco a more attractive CMS for agencies and enterprises
What’s Next?
We’re offering so many other amazing featuresfor your Umbraco Website, go ahead and check them out here.

Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. 
“Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said.

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.

The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.

“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ether (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bancor, the creator of a smart contract-based automated market maker, is suing Uniswap for patent infringement, alleging the decentralized finance exchange has used its technology without permission and profited significantly from it.
According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. 
Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Argentine President Javier Milei has dissolved a task force established to investigate the fallout from LIBRA, the scandalous cryptocurrency project the head of state promoted on his social media channel before it crashed to zero. 
The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed. 
“The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read.
The task force is being dissolved despite pressure from opposition groups, which are seeking to activate an investigative commission as soon as May 20, local media outlet Clarin reported.

Ether’s price rose over 5% to $2,520 on May 20, mirroring similar upward moves across the wider cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum’s record open interest, rising funding rates and a significant short squeeze fuel the rally.

Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.
The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.
In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises "thin" protocols and "fat" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower ret…]]></summary>

On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.
