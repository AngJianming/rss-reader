Polymorphism is one of the most powerful and flexible features in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While inheritance might be the most unique aspect of OOP, polymorphism is arguably its most powerful tool. But what exactly is polymorphism, and how does it work in Python? In this article, we'll break down the concept, explain how it works with examples, and show you how to use it effectively in your own code.
The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek roots "poly," meaning "many," and "morph," meaning "form." In the context of programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. Essentially, it allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface.

Inheritance is one of the most powerful features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing developers to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, promote code reuse, and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. However, as powerful as inheritance is, it’s not always the right tool for the job. Misusing inheritance can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code. In this article, we’ll explore when and where you should use inheritance in Python, helping you make informed decisions in your software design.
Before diving into when and where to use inheritance, it’s important to understand its primary purposes:

Inheritance is often considered the "holy grail" of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While many programming languages offer features like encapsulation and abstraction, inheritance is a powerful feature unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what inheritance is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of inheritance and how to apply it effectively in your own projects.
Inheritance is a feature in OOP that allows one class, known as the "child" class, to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the "parent" class. This means that the child class can use all the features of the parent class, reducing the need to write redundant code.

When you first hear about encapsulation in programming, it might sound like it’s related to security—hiding data away to keep it safe. However, in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is more about organization and managing complexity. In this article, we’ll explore what encapsulation really means in Python, why it’s important, and some common misconceptions about it.
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It’s a way to hide the inner workings of a class from the outside world, exposing only what’s necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields' validity states. 
This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be "valid" without the preceding being "valid", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.]]></summary>

“OKX also has consumers protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or an oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post.
OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either
Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,”  Xu said.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Glover said that holding onto the BTC carries several benefits including, price appreciation, tax deferment, and the potential to make extra revenue by lending out BTC held in corporate treasuries. The executive added:

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.
In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

Analyst predicts that a low VIX, specifically below 18, signals a risk-on market, which could potentially boost the Bitcoin price to $135,000 within the next 100 days.

The stablecoin market cap hits $220 billion, driving crypto liquidity and Bitcoin’s bullish price action.

A negative Bitcoin funding rate hints at a possible short-squeeze to $100,000.

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.
