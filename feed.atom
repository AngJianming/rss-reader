Examples of Side Channels:
Power Consumption — Measuring how much power a device uses during operations.


Timing Information - Tracking how long different operations take.


Electromagnetic Leaks - Capturing data through EM emissions.


Acoustic Signals - Even the sound of a keyboard or CPU coil can leak secrets.


Cache Usage - Analyzing memory access patterns in CPUs.



Side channel attacks are considered among the most dangerous for several reasons:
Bypass Traditional Defenses

1. Master the Fundamentals First


Before jumping into frameworks, ensure you have a solid grasp of:

✅ HTML (Semantic markup, accessibility)

✅ CSS (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design)

✅ JavaScript (ES6+, DOM manipulation, async/await)  
2. Learn Version Control (Git & GitHub)


Git is a must-know tool for collaboration. Learn basic commands (commit, push, pull, branch) and contribute to open-source projects.  
3. Write Clean, Maintainable Code



Follow naming conventions (e.g., BEM for CSS).

Keep functions small and reusable.

Comment where necessary (but don’t overdo it).

A client is basically any device or app that makes requests to a server. Think of it like the "requester" in the equation. It could be:
A web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) loading a webpage
A mobile app asking for user info
An IoT device sending sensor data
The client asks the server for information or resources, and then displays that data (like showing a webpage or app content).
The server is where all the magic happens behind the scenes. It’s a system that listens for requests, processes them, and sends back the right data. Servers are responsible for things like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At M47 Labs, we work on many AI and cloud-native projects where secret management becomes complex — especially across environments and CI/CD pipelines. We're big fans of AWS SSM for storing configuration and secrets securely, but syncing them into .env files can be painful and repetitive.
To solve this in a cleaner and more reliable way, I built a CLI tool: 👉 Envilder on GitHub
Envilder reads a mapping file that links environment variable names to AWS SSM parameter paths.
.env file.
Your param-map.json might look like this:
{
  "DB_HOST": "/my-app/dev/DB_HOST",
  "DB_PASSWORD": "/my-app/dev/DB_PASSWORD"
}

Run:
envilder --map=param-map.json --envfile=.env

And you get:
DB_HOST=mydb.cluster-xyz.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PASSWORD=supersecret

You can also use different AWS CLI profiles:
AWS_PROFILE=staging envilder --map=param-map.json --envfile=.env

This small tool makes a big difference when:
🧑‍💻 Onboarding new team members: no more “what’s the DB password?”
🔄 Keeping environments in sync: any change in SSM is reflected across the team
⚙️ CI/CD pipelines always up-to-date: e.g. GitHub Actions, CodeBuild, GitLab
🧼 Centralized configuration: avoid duplication and keep secrets in one secure place
🧭 Supports multiple AWS profiles: ideal for multi-account or multi-env setups
Works with SecureString and plain parameters
CLI-first, fast, and script-friendly
Compatible with any CI system
Supports static values and fallbacks
AWS profile support (AWS_PROFILE)
npm install -g envilder

Or:
envilder --map=param-map.json --envfile=.env --profile=aws-account

It’s still an early-stage project, but already helpful in several real-world teams.
If this sounds familiar, or you’ve solved this differently, I’d love to hear from you.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…]]></summary>

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.

Robert Kiyosaki says ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin, gold, and silver
Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.

However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.
“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”
The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.
According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market continued to surge this past week as the overall digital asset market capitalization exceeded $3.27 trillion, an 8.6% increase over the previous week.
Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports.

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential election.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.
