LeetCode 3442: Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I.
This one’s all about counting how often characters appear and performing a bit of clever subtraction. Let’s break it down and solve it cleanly in C++, JavaScript, and Python.
You're given a string s made of lowercase English letters.
Your task is to compute the maximum difference diff = a₁ - a₂ such that:
a₁ is the frequency of a character with odd frequency.
a₂ is the frequency of a character with even frequency.
📌 Constraints:
3 <= s.length <= 100
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
Frequencies:
- a: 5 (odd)
- b: 2 (even)
- c: 1 (odd)

maxOdd = 5
minEven = 2
Output: 5 - 2 = 3

Input: s = "abcabcab"
Frequencies:
- a: 3 (odd…]]></summary>

I assume you already know how to use a shell to run commands, and that you have git installed.

It borrows ideas from Rust, Go, and Swift—languages known for their clean error-handling patterns—and brings those benefits to JS developers.

try/catch Gets Messy


JavaScript's try/catch can clutter your logic, especially when multiple async operations are involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cuando inicié a trabajar en la nube, creía que la plataforma era similar a Google Drive o Dropbox donde se suben los archivos o las fotografías que ya no caben en tu teléfono, creía que un trabajo en estas plataformas estaban relacionado con subir archivos lo más rápido posible, y como eso parecía tan sencillo decidí empezar mi carrera en la nube. 
La siguiente limpieza de recursos, no sólo estuvo relacionada con lo tecnológico, también con lo humano, y perdí mi trabajo 🙁, al igual que muchos de mis compañeros de área, se dice que esa limpieza de recursos fue muy efectiva a nivel de costos, y algunos meses después la empresa abandonó la nube, lo que se conoce como “repatriación de la nube” así que yo me volví una hater de la nube, ahora sin trabajo, y sin nube, regresé a las búsquedas en internet, no sólo para buscar un nuevo trabajo, si no para obtenerlo y no perderlo. 
Tras muchos años, me gusta catalogar esta historia como mi momento más humilde, pues fue una serie de eventos desafortunados que me llevaron a FinOps y que ahora, me siento feliz de recordar con cada proyecto que inicio para entender que los costos no sólo necesitan ser reducidos, requieren ser optimizados, y también recordar que en esta metodología no sólo hablamos de dinero, hablamos de cultura de innovación y valor (final feliz, he sido recontratada para ser FinOps en esa misma compañía en su reingreso a la nube)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem Description & Analysis:


A certain database table has multiple fields that can be grouped.

Task: Now we need to perform conditional grouping: group by the first two fields ID and SPLIT. If there are no duplicate DATEs within the group, keep the record with the latest date in this group and replace AMOUNT with the sum of AMOUNTs in this group; If there are duplicate dates within the group, group the records in this group again by CUST, while retaining the record with the latest date in the current group, and replace the AMOUNT with the sum of the AMOUNTs in the current group.

SQL:
SELECT id, split,cust,date_column,
       CASE num_cust WHEN 1 THEN total_amount ELSE total_cust_amount  END AS amount
FROM   (
  SELECT t.*,
         COUNT(DISTINCT CASE rnk WHEN 1 THEN cust END)
           OVER (PARTITION BY id, split) AS num_cust
  FROM   (
    SELECT t.*,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY id, split ORDER BY date_column DESC) AS rnk,
           SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY id, split) AS total_amount,
           SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY id, split, cust) AS total_cust_amount
    FROM   test_table_mm t
  ) t
  WHERE  rnk = 1
)

SQL cannot retain grouped subsets and requires the use of multiple nested queries and multiple window functions for indirect implementation, resulting in complex code.
SPL: After SPL grouping, there is no need to aggregate immediately. The subsets can be kept for further calculation, and subsets can also continue to be grouped:
💭🧮 Try.DEMO

A1： Load data and sort it in reverse order by date.
A2： Group by the first two fields, but do not aggregate.
A3： Process each group of data: If the date is not duplicated, return the current group; otherwise, group the current group by CUST and return each group.
A4： Continue processing data of each group: Take the first record of the current group and replace AMOUNT with the sum of AMOUNTs of the current group.
