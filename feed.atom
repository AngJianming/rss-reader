Project Title:
Chessboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Project Description:
Today, I built a simple 8x8 Chessboard using HTML, CSS Grid, and JavaScript DOM manipulation. This project helped me understand how to create dynamic elements using JavaScript and apply CSS classes conditionally.
Important JavaScript Topics Covered:
1.DOM Manipulation:
document.createElement() to create div elements dynamically.
2.Loops (For Loop):
for loops generated 8 rows and 8 columns for the chessboard.
3.Conditional Statements (if-else):
(row + col) % 2 == 0 to create the chess pattern.
4.setAttribute() Method:
id and class attributes dynamically for each square.
5.CSS Grid:
grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 60px);

This made 8 columns of equal size.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I’m sitting down to integrate an AI into an application, I follow a pretty consistent mental checklist. It’s all about guiding the AI, step by step.
Before I even type my first prompt, I try to understand the AI model itself. Is it a language model, an image generator, or something else? What kind of data was it trained on? Knowing its strengths (and more importantly, its weaknesses) helps me set realistic expectations. I also dig into the API documentation to see what parameters I can tweak — things like temperature (how creative or "safe" the response is) or max_tokens (how long the response can be). These are my knobs and dials for fine-tuning.
Treat your AI like a junior developer: give it clear instructions, context, and examples, and it’ll surprise you with what it can achieve.

The lead architect confidently presented their "micro-frontend solution" – and I watched in horror as they described what was essentially a glorified component library.
"We'll create reusable components," they enthusiastically explained, "the Login component, the Dashboard component, the UserProfile component. Each team can own their components, and we'll have micro-frontends!"

A dismissal for want of prosecution happens when a court closes a case because the plaintiff—the person who started the lawsuit—has not taken action to move it forward. This might include missing deadlines, not submitting necessary paperwork, or allowing the case to sit without progress.
Courts expect parties to stay engaged and push their cases forward. If a case remains inactive for too long, the court may decide to dismiss it.
If your case is dismissed for want of prosecution, it usually works in the defendant’s favor because the case ends without a ruling on the ac…]]></summary>
