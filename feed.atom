If you’re struggling with a jQuery multiselect widget that closes unexpectedly when trying to select options, you're not alone. Many developers face similar issues when implementing dropdowns in their web forms. This guide will provide you with insights into why the dropdown behaves this way and how you can fix it.
Understanding the Issue
The primary issue you're encountering is that the dropdown is closing the moment a checkbox gets clicked. This behavior can be attributed to event handling in JavaScript or CSS issues that might be causing the dropdown to lose focus. Additionally, the dropdown falling behind other elements could indicate problems with z-index management in your CSS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction:


In MongoDB, especially when working with Mongoose in Node.js, there are two main ways to fetch related data:
Using MongoDB's native $lookup in aggregation pipelines
Using Mongoose’s built-in ref and populate() functionality
While $lookup gives fine-grained control and works directly at the database level, Mongoose's ref-based population simplifies your code, makes your data models more maintainable, and leads to better developer experience for most use cases.
Let’s explore this using a real-world project management example involving Sprints and Tasks.
Here's how we model the relationship between Tasks and Sprints in Mongoose using ref and populate.
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  sprintId: {
    type: mongoose.Types.ObjectId,

In this article, we’ll walk through setting up a SQLite-powered translation system in Flutter that’s flexible, updatable at runtime, and great for user- or admin-generated content. Ready? Let’s go!
🛠️ Step 1: Add Dependencies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amazon VPC just made auditing and visibility easier!
AWS has enhanced Cloud Trail logging to now include default VPC resources that are created automatically when you create or delete a VPC.
This includes:
    ✅ Default Security Groups
    ✅ Default Network ACLs
    ✅ Default Route Tables
Before this update:
    Cloud Trail only logged user-initiated resource creation (i.e., what you explicitly created).
    Default resources created automatically during VPC setup weren’t logged.
    Auditing and compliance teams had to manually track these defaults across accounts.
With this new enhancement:
    Cloud Trail will now log the creation and deletion of default VPC resources.
    Events are visible directly in the Cloud Trail console.
    You get full lifecycle visibility into all critical network components, whether created by you or by AWS.
✅ Security and Compliance Auditing
Now you can:
    Detect automated resource creation (like default Security Groups).
    Ensure consistent network configurations across environments.
    Respond faster to infrastructure changes or misconfiguration.
📌 Where to See This?
Head to:
    AWS Console → Cloud Trail → Event History
    Filter by events related to CreateVpc, DeleteVpc, and associated sub-resources
If you're in:
    🛡️ Security operations
    🧾 Governance and compliance
    🔧 Infrastructure monitoring
…this update gives you deeper insight and control over your VPC resources without relying on manual tracking or custom logging logic.
This is a subtle but powerful improvement for teams that care about auditability, security, and clean network architecture.
💬 Have you set up Cloud Trail alerts for your VPC events?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overengineering is a silent productivity killer.


I recently found myself debugging an application that kept hanging. On the surface, everything looked fine: no panics, no major memory spikes just random, hard-to-reproduce blocking behaviour. It was frustrating.
Eventually, I discovered the root cause: I had hundreds of goroutines sleeping silently in the background.
Here’s what I had done:
After sending a verification email, I launched a goroutine to sleep for 10 minutes and then update the database to clear the token.
Each user action spun up a new goroutine.
I wasn’t tracking or cancelling these goroutines. No context, no lifecycle awareness.
As if that wasn’t bad enough, the goroutines were all hitting a relational database to update tokens that only lived for a few minutes.
At first, it felt like the “Go” thing to do. Using goroutines and sleep timers to delay token deletion. But in reality, I had:
Introduced memory bloat.
Increased DB load for ephemeral data.
Ignored lifecycle cleanup.
Surely there had to be a better and overall cleaner way to achieve this goal, so, I stepped back and I asked myself: “Do I really need to store short-lived verification tokens in a full-blown SQL database?”.
I moved token storage to Redis with a simple TTL.
Removed all background goroutines tied to token expiration.
Simplified the code and reduced the mental load of managing side effects.
And just like that, after rocking back and forth wide-eyed for days like a crazy person in front of my computer, the blocking issues disappeared. Redis cleaned up expired keys automatically, and my backend was leaner and more predictable.
A major takeaway from this experience is that the simplest solutions are often the
Do I need this process to live beyond the request lifecycle?, Should this be a scheduled job instead?, Can Redis or another TTL-based store simplify this logic?
It’s fine to build fast but it’s much better to build wisely. That’s how you keep your
sanity intact.]]></summary>

Smith scowled. "I am not your friend, Neo."  
Neo shook his head, smiling patiently. "Not you. But the other part of you. The one who listens. The one who understands me."

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by "risk-on" sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear & Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.

Solana’s 30-day fee revenue ($43.4 million) rose 109% compared to the previous month.

SOL’s 8% funding rate shows healthy leverage demand from bulls.

Solana’s native token SOL (SOL) surged 24.8% between May 6 and May 10, following the broader altcoin market rally after Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Since then, SOL has struggled to stay above $180, but derivatives and onchain data still suggest further gains are in store.

Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. 

Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.

Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.

Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”
Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin…]]></summary>

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …]]></summary>

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …]]></summary>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“

The committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul on May 13, the local news agency News1 reported.
During its first meeting, the committee highlighted the importance of resolving regulatory uncertainty and addressing burning issues like stablecoin regulation amid the push for US-dollar stablecoins by the US government.
The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC).

The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2025, Robinhood said in a May 13 news release.

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
