Ever wondered where all that "stuff" on the internet lives? A lot of it, especially things like documents, images, and videos, ends up in places like Azure Blob Storage. Think of it as a giant, super-organized digital warehouse in the cloud. Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's service that lets you store tons of this unstructured data. It's designed to grow as much as you need, keep your data safe, and not cost you a fortune. In this blog post, we'll break down Azure Blob Storage, its features, how it keeps your data safe (redundancy), and how to use it like a pro.
What is Azure Blob Storage?
Imagine you have a massive amount of stuff to store—way more than your computer could handle. Azure Blob Storage is like a limitless storage space in Microsoft's cloud where you can keep al…]]></summary>

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Microservices architecture has been one of the most debated topics in software engineering over the past decade. While many organizations have successfully adopted this pattern, there's growing skepticism about whether microservices are often an over-engineered solution to problems that could be solved with simpler architectures. This article explores why microservices generate so much criticism, examines valid concerns about over-engineering, and presents alternative approaches like clean three-layer architecture that might offer better solutions for many projects - with a powerful ally that simplifies it.

  Introduction


Software engineers face unique knowledge management challenges. We need to track code snippets, architecture decisions, algorithm explanations, complex workflows, and more—often across multiple projects simultaneously. This post explores why traditional note-taking systems fall short and how Obsidian can be adapted to the specific needs of developers.
This is the first post in the "Obsidian for Engineers" series. Stay tuned for the full content!

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network.

I am building a full-stack restaurant reservation platform as a portfolio project. It features both a public-facing reservation site and an admin dashboard — all built on top of React Router Framework Mode, with a PostgreSQL + Prisma backend and a modern UI stack.
Although the app uses dummy data, it’s fully functional and architected like a real-world production system.
🔗 Live Demo: https://my-booking.tech/
https://github.com/YuichiNabeshima/my-booking
I’m currently open to software engineering roles — especially full-stack roles involving React, TypeScript, and scalable backend architecture.

React Router inherits the Remix philosophy — staying close to web standards, server-side rendering by default, and minimizing client-side overhead.
⚙️ The result: a fast, SSR-first app with minimal use of global state or client-side data fetching libraries.
The frontend is built with modern functional React, while the backend follows a more class-based, structured design — a mix that reflects real-world systems I’ve worked on and enjoy building.
📅 Guests can book without creating an account
🔐 Secure, unique reservation URLs via JWT
🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard to manage bookings and restaurants
⚡️ SSR-first architecture with minimal client-side state
✅ Type-safe forms with full validation
React Router (Framework Mode) + TypeScript


PostgreSQL + Prisma


Redis (Upstash) + Custom session-based auth


JWT for reservation access


Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui


Zod + Conform for form validation


Amazon S3 / SES for file and email handling


Fly.io for hosting




  
  
  👋 I'm Open to Work


I'm currently looking for roles focused on full-stack development — particularly with React, TypeScript, and scalable backend architecture.
If you’re hiring (or know someone who is), I’d love to connect!
💬 I’d be happy to answer any questions about the tech choices or structure!

In an April 29 hearing of the High Court of Karnataka, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the government to “block forthwith” domain names associated with Proton Mail, citing authority under the country’s Information Technology Act of 2008. The order stemmed from a complaint filed in January by a New Delhi-based design firm, alleging that some of its employees received offensive emails through the service.  
It’s unclear whether the ban will take effect or face other possible challenges in court. The Proton team reported in March 2024 that Indian authorities had similarly proposed ordering the service blocked in response to alleged “hoax bomb threats,”…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed deciding on whether to greenlight two proposed cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding Dogecoin and XRP, filings show. 
The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 
Dogecoin is the world’s most heavily traded memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $26 billion as of April 29, according to data from CoinGecko. X…]]></summary>

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

The Amsterdam-based neobank announced the launch of Bunq Crypto on April 29, a new offering enabling its users to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
Starting April 29, Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium will be able to access cryptocurrencies directly through the Bunq app, according to an announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.
