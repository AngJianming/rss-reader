        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The promise was seductive: machines capable of learning, adapting, even thinking. From the clunky expert systems of the 80s to the sleek neural networks of today, artificial intelligence has consistently overpromised and underdelivered…until now. The recent explosion in AI capabilities, fuelled by vast datasets and unprecedented computing power, has delivered systems that can generate convincing text, create startlingly realistic images, and even outperform humans in complex games. But this newfound power comes at a cost: a creeping erosion of trust, a sense that the algorithmic genie is slipping its confines.
The initial fascination with AI in the mid-20th century hinged on a naive belief in objectivity. Early AI research, heavily influenced by the logic-driven world of mathematics and co…]]></summary>

Email remains the most reliable, measurable, and cost-effective communication channel for businesses worldwide. Whether it’s sending order confirmations, customer newsletters, onboarding sequences, or transactional alerts, email provides direct and personalized access to customer inboxes.
In the fast-paced digital economy, delivering timely and relevant emails is key to enhancing the customer experience. Brands that communicate consistently build loyalty, boost customer lifetime value, and improve retention. From startups to enterprises, email is essential not only for marketing but also for critical transactional notifications such as password resets, purchase receipts, and account updates.

😩 3 AM server alerts when traffic spikes.


📈 Scaling nightmares as users flood in.


💸 Paying $200/month for servers that sit idle 80% of the time.



What if your app scaled to millions instantly—while you slept? Enter Firebase Functions: the serverless engine that powers real-time apps with zero server drama. I’ve shipped 20+ real-time projects on it. Let’s break free.  
Why Firebase Functions for Real-Time?


Firebase Functions aren’t just “serverless.” They’re real-time superchargers:  
Event-Driven: Trigger code when data changes (new chat message, user login, file upload).


Millisecond Latency: Respond to events before users blink.

When programming in C, we generally use shared memory for communication. When multiple threads operate on a shared piece of data concurrently, to ensure data safety and control thread synchronization, we use mutexes to lock and unlock as needed.
However, in Go, it's recommended to share memory by communicating—using channels to complete critical section synchronization mechanisms.
That said, channels in Go are relatively high-level primitives and naturally have lower performance compared to the locking mechanisms in the sync package. If you're interested, you can write a simple benchmark test yourself to compare their performance, and discuss your findings in the comments.
Moreover, when using the sync package to control synchronization, you do not lose ownership of the …]]></summary>

Right now, I’m building Snippai, an AI-powered screenshot assistant designed to help you get more out of the images on your screen. It can:
🧠 Understand text, formulas, tables, and code in screenshots


📄 Convert content into LaTeX, Markdown, or structured formats


🔍 Extract and summarize important information from visual content


⚡ All in one click — no prompts, no extra work






Snippai is designed for students, developers, researchers, and professionals who often work with visual data and want a smarter way to reuse or understand it.
As someone who deals with code, technical diagrams, and research papers daily, I found myself constantly taking screenshots and manually retyping or copying content. That felt like a waste of time — so I decided to build something better.
Frontend: Electron + React + Typescript
This is just the beginning. I'm currently iterating fast, and would love feedback, suggestions, or just to connect with like-minded builders. Feel free to say hi in the comments — and if you’ve built something similar or are working in this space, I’d love to check it out!
Thanks for reading, and I look forward to contributing more here on Dev.to 🙌
The project is open-source on Github: Snippai Feel free to check it out and give a star if you like it!]]></summary>

So you've been hearing a lot about Claude Opus and Sonnet-4, huh? Maybe you’re curious to see how they compare to GPT-4o, or just want to try them out in a lightweight playground like Windsurf. Good news: it's totally possible to hook them up yourself—no waiting, no credits required from Windsurf—just bring your own API key.
Here’s how I did it.
First, head over to the Anthropic Console.
Log in (or sign up).
Go to the API Keys tab.
If you haven't already, add a credit card and load some credits.
You'll be prompted to create a new API key. Copy that key somewhere safe.
Now go to Windsurf's API Key Settin…]]></summary>

Hey folks, Maks here 👋 CTO at Microns.io and Webflow/low-code mentor. After a few years of building full-featured products with surprisingly tiny teams, I’m convinced that low-code databases are the real deal—and they’re flipping the script on how we think about app development.
I’ve used them to launch global platforms, ship real features in weeks instead of months, and collaborate with non-tech teammates in ways I didn’t think were possible a few years ago. So let me share how low-code backends like Xano, Airtable, Supabase, and friends are changing the game—and why you should care.
