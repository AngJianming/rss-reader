AI powered interview platforms are now common in hiring, asking questions tailored to your skills and analyzing your answers with little human effort. They seem like a smart way for companies to find talent quickly. But a serious worry is starting to surface, especially for developers and job seekers like you: some bad actors might be using these platforms to pull sensitive company information from candidates. What feels like a normal job interview could actually be a sneaky way to collect corporate secrets and sell them to third parties. This is a real issue that needs attention, because many people do not even realize it could be happening to them.
Experienced developers, especially those with many years in the industry, are noticing something strange when they go through …]]></summary>

PostgreSQL 18 introduces a significant enhancement under the hood with its new asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem. According to the official release notes, this feature is designed to increase I/O throughput and to hide I/O latency. It can be enabled via the io_method server variable. For Linux users, this means io_uring can be leveraged, while a worker-based implementation is available for all platforms. The initial implementation focuses on file system reads, including sequential scans, bitmap heap scans, and vacuums. A new system view, pg_aios, will also be available to show file handles used for AIO.

Leveraging OpenAI and JS File API that became extremely viral and gathers attention of around 50K readers.

In it, I walk through a real-world scenario where you combine:
🧠 OpenAI’s powerful LLMs - to send meaningful prompts to OpenAI

📂 JavaScript’s File API - to extract and stream file content using the JS File Reader API

⚙️ Frontend logic that bridges both - code snippets, UX tips, and more
You’ll learn how to build a seamless experience where your app can take an uploaded file, process its contents, and produce smart, contextual responses — all inside the browser.

This piece is ideal for frontend developers, indie makers, and AI-curious engineers who want to bring ChatGPT-style intelligence into their UIs today.
And if you end up building something cool with it — I’d love to hear about it!

Zakaz is a lightweight CLI tool that automatically creates index.ts or index.js files for each folder in your project, streamlining the way you import and export modules. It helps you avoid repetitive and error-prone manual exports, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.
Zakaz recursively walks through your project directories, identifies all eligible files (typically .ts, .tsx, .js, or .jsx), and generates corresponding index.ts or index.js files that re-export them. This allows you to simply import a folder instead of specifying each file individually.

Hello everyone,
I am pleased to introduce FEAScript (Website | GitHub), a library I began developing in 2023. FEAScript is a finite element simulation library written entirely in JavaScript.
FEAScript is designed to run entirely in the front end, for these key reasons:
Users don’t need to install back-end solvers, configure environments, or manage dependencies. All you need is a browser to start experimenting.
Educators can embed simulations in online courses or tutorials. Imagine a "JSFiddle for finite elements." Users can tweak parameters and instantly see the results — encouraging interactive learning.
v0.1.0)



  
  
  🧠 Physical Modelling



Solid heat conduction solver (1D & 2D)
Simple mesh generation for basic domains (1D & 2D)
Unstructured 2D quadrilateral mesh import from Gmsh




  
  
  ⚙️ Numerical Solution



Jacobi iterative method

LU decomposition via math.js




  
  
  📊 Parallelization



Web Worker support
Line and surface plotting via Plotly.js







  
  
  🧩 Introducing the FEAScript Platform


I’ve also started developing the FEAScript Platform – a no-code, block-based GUI built using Blockly. It's designed to make FEAScript more accessible.
Think: LEGO for simulations.

It enables users of all skill levels to create and explore finite element models — visually.
👉 Explore the FEAScript Platform here
Note: Both FEAScript and the Platform are currently in experimental stages.
If you find the project interesting or promising, consider joining in building a community around FEAScript. Check out the future roadmap and contribute to:
Development
Testing

Feedback & Ideas
Whether you're an engineer, educator, student, or developer — your contributions are welcome!

Most AI code tools I've tried (like Cursor, Copilot, etc.) produce general-purpose code that's often unusable in real-world projects.

They might write code quickly, but the result is:
unpredictable,
hard to maintain,
and often completely wrong ( not usable ).
So I built something different:

A tool where I can explicitly define patterns and precisely control which classes are referenced.
Yes, it takes some upfront work to define the rules.

But the result?

→ Code that's testable, maintainable, and consistent with your actual architecture.
In this demo, 400 lines of Java code (including tests) were generated in 20 seconds.

All tests passed without manual edits.
If you're tired of copy-pasting boilerplate and want AI that respects your structure — give this a try.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it’s a “…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quantum Biopharma has purchased an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Canadian biotechnology company said. 
The buys take Quantum’s total cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a May 19 press release. The biotech company plans to stake a portion of its crypto to generate revenue. 
Quantum expects that holding a treasury of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets will “provide a return on investment for shareholders and […] provide some hedge against the Canadian dollar,” it said. 
Shares of Quantum’s stock, QNTM, rose by approximately 25% following the announcement, according to data from Google Finance.

In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.
“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:

“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”

Bitcoin’s rejection at $107,000 shows sellers are active at higher levels, but the recovery from the intraday low shows solid buying.

Select altcoins have pulled back, but they have not yet turned negative.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.
“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.

Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.

Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.

Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply clus…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price fell 1.4% to $102,460 amid US economic concerns, with daily trading volume up 94%, indicating the return of sellers.

Moody’s US credit downgrade to Aa1 and a class-action lawsuit against Strategy add to BTC’s headwinds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by over 1.4% over the last 24 hours to $102,460 as concerns over the health of the US economy sour investor sentiment. Its daily trading volume has jumped by 94% to $66.6 billion, suggesting that the sell-side activity is intensifying.

Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.
Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.
Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.
