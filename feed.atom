        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most developers use AI like a simple search engine. They ask basic questions and get basic answers. But I discovered 5 different prompting strategies that actually leverage AI's reasoning capabilities.
These aren't just variations of "fix my code" - they're fundamentally different approaches that solve different problems.

I'm working on [brief project description].

[Your specific question/request]

Consider performance, maintainability, and best practices in your response.

Why it works: AI performs dramatically better when given a specific role and project context. It's the difference between getting generic advice vs. expert guidance.

The LLM landscape is evolving rapidly - and so are the tools and workflows that developers use to build and improve their LLM applications. To empower our community and invite deeper collaboration, we’ve decided to open source all previously commercial features of Langfuse.
That means you can now self-host features like:
Managed LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations


Annotation queues


Prompt experiments

LLM playground
All fully open under the MIT license.

If you're already self-hosting Langfuse, upgrade to the latest version to unlock these new features.

After looking at incident reports, some clear patterns emerge. The same few issues keep causing the majority of production failures.
42% of AI agent failures come from hallucinated API calls, and another 23% are GPU memory leaks. These aren't edge cases - they're systematic problems that need systematic solutions.
Here's what's actually breaking and how to prevent it.
LLMs generate code that looks correct but calls non-existent methods or deprecated endpoints. Traditional validation tools miss this because the code is syntactically valid - it just references APIs that don't exist in your environment.

In order to translate a document or PDF and keep formatting, layout, images, etc. (a good portion of it), the language translation software you are using must encode the file. These files need to be in a deliverable format matching the original source file. However, many translation tools don’t have the functionality in place to save you hours of time on re-formatting your translated document.
Consequently, you get displaced images, lost font properties and wacky paragraph breaks — or a lack thereof. This becomes especially problematic when you’re tasked with translating doc…]]></summary>

I can even though it's been quite long.
I remember the first post I did, circa August 2018, was after I finished a short coding Bootcamp that I got into thanks to a friend.
It's the first time I made a post of technical nature online in English (my second language).
I still cringe a little reading it... But it was a stepping stone into technical writing (which I'd later find out it's quite difficult). 
I only started wanting to write for real in January of 2020. Made 2 posts that month, couldn't keep up with a regular posting schedule and then you know what happened that year...
With the extra time from being locked down at my home, I resumed the writing at the end of June and then kept going on posting (mostly) weekly for the rest of that year (and then the year afterwards).
It's been quite a wild ride with all its ups and downs. 
And maybe it's time to come back here to post my learnings and experiences about my new undertaking in the World's Largest Hackathon of Bolt(dot)new.]]></summary>

I thought I was on schedule for today's issue, until I realized that Dan Abramov wrote 4 RSC blog posts this week 😂. We also get great releases, including Storybook, LiveStore, Base UI, and the Lingo Compiler is a quite exciting innovation. The community is still processing last week's Remix awakening with many videos and podcasts commenting on the news.
React Native devs were at App.js last week, where the React Native team unveiled their plan to freeze the Legacy Architecture.
The last TC39 meeting was also quite productive, with 3 proposals progressing to stage 4 among other things. We also got various interesting announcements from the Vite ecosystem.

No longer confined to the realm of science fiction, artificial intelligence is actively reshaping the UK’s political landscape. From refining voter targeting to assisting policy analysis, AI is now a practical tool, impacting how campaigns are fought, how decisions are made, and how citizens engage with the democratic process. The shift isn't a revolution, but a slow, pervasive integration – a recalibration of long-established political norms driven by data and algorithms.
The application of data analytics in UK political campaigning began in earnest during the 2010 General Election, largely focused on simple demographic targeting using data from the electoral roll and commercially available lifestyle databases.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've learned Git basics but still feel confused about Gitflow branching, this post is for you. We'll go step-by-step with real commands using a simple HTML project hosted on an Ubuntu EC2 instance.
Gitflow is a branching strategy that helps structure development around:
New features
Release preparation
Hotfixes
It uses these main branches:



Branch Name
Purpose




main
Stable production-ready code


develop
Ongoing integration of all features


feature/*
New feature development


release/*
Preparing a release (QA/final tweaks)


hotfix/*
Urgent fix for production issues



We’ll build a feature called “Add to Cart Animation” to simulate the workflow.
