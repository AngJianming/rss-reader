        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed two key cryptocurrency-related bills that aimed to expand the state’s involvement in digital assets while simultaneously signing a strict regulatory measure targeting Bitcoin ATMs.
On May 12, Hobbs rejected Senate Bill 1373, which sought to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund. The fund would have allowed Arizona to hold crypto assets obtained through seizures or legislative allocations.
“Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars,” she stated in her veto letter. “I have already signed legislation this session which allows the state to utilize cryptocurrency without placing general fund dollars at risk,” she added.

Why it matters: A developer’s exit is an opportunity to gather insights and safeguard company assets.  
Exit Interviews: Schedule a candid conversation to understand their reasons for leaving. Ask about challenges they faced, tools they found ineffective, or team dynamics that could improve. This feedback can uncover systemic issues and reduce future turnover.

Some of the most effective feedback conversations I have had - both from giving and receiving - actually started with a letter.

When there's a lot to say, taking the time to write it down helps in more ways than one. It lets you rewrite, refine, and make sure the message you intend is the message that gets carried forward. You can catch moments where your tone might be too harsh, or where you're speaking from frustration instead of clarity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the next pikoTutorial !
Imagine you're building an application that processes some data and once it's done, the user needs to be notified about the result. Since you don’t want to hard-code the notification logic, it’s better to allow the user to register a custom function that will be called automatically after the data processing completes.
std::function for callback registration


One of the most flexible ways to implement callbacks in C++ is by using std::function. std::function can store and invoke any callable object (functions, lambdas, or function objects) that matches a specific signature. The overall syntax is:
std::function<function_return_type(function_argument_types)> name;

Let’s define a ProcessData unction that accepts a callback and notifies the user once processing is complete.
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>
// Type alias for the callback type
using CallbackType = std::function<void(const bool)>;
// Function accepting callback as an argument
void ProcessData(const CallbackType& callback) {
    // Simulate data processing
    std::cout << "Processing data" << std::endl;
    // Notify user via callback
    callback(true);
}
// Callback function definition
void Callback(const bool result) {
    std::cout << "Callback called! Result: " << result << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Register a callback using an existing function
    ProcessData(Callback);
    // Register a callback using lambda function
    ProcessData([](const bool result) {
        std::cout << "Lambda called! Result: " << result << std::endl;
    });
    // Register using callable object
    CallbackType cb = [](const bool result){
        std::cout << "Callable called! Result: " << result << std::endl;
    };
    ProcessData(cb);
}]]></summary>

JavaScript is packed with powerful features—but many developers stick to the basics and miss out on time-saving gems. In this post, I’ll show you 7 underrated tricks that can simplify your code, enhance readability, and make you look like a JavaScript pro in 2025.
?.





const username = user?.profile?.name || 'Anonymous';

✅ Avoids errors when deeply nested properties are undefined. Cleaner and safer than long logical chains.
??





const count = inputValue ?? 0;

✅ Returns default only if the left-hand value is null or undefined (unlike ||, which includes 0 or '').
const { title: blogTitle } = post;

✅ Grab and rename properties in one line.
const isAvailable = !!value;

✅ Quickly turn any truthy/falsy value into a clean true or false.
const user = { name, age }; // same as { name: name, age: age }

✅ Reduces repetition when property and variable names match.
const key = 'theme';
const settings = { [key]: 'dark' };

✅ Build flexible objects based on runtime values.
const status = `You are ${loggedIn ? 'logged in' : 'logged out'}.`;

✅ Great for short conditional strings and UI feedback.
These tricks may be small, but they add up to cleaner, more elegant JavaScript code. Whether you're working on a side project, fixing bugs, or building production apps—mastering these patterns will level up your skills.
✅ Try using at least 2 of these in your next app!

In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. 
Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lap via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
