        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin for $513 million, according to an official statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account.
The announcement is the first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by GameStop since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March 2025.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.
The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Rumors began circulating in February.
Source: GameStop
Shares of GameStop (GME) stock climbed amid the speculation, jumping 12% in March. The February speculation fueled an 18% spike in GME stock prices.
According to TradingView, GameStop shares closed at $35 on May 27 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market at the time of publication. The stock is up around 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of roughly 10%.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Prices nosedive like they saw a spider and never bounce back. It's less "Wall Street" and more "Fall Street." At this point, it's not a trading game — it's a slow-motion market apocalypse. 10/10 would not invest. But hey, dev life. 💀📉

From hyper-personalization to fraud detection and intelligent automation, AI promises transformative outcomes. Yet, there’s a persistent and costly problem: most AI projects never make it past the proof-of-concept (POC) phase.
According to Gartner, only 53% of AI models are successfully deployed into production, leaving the majority of efforts stuck in isolated experimentation. The result? Wasted investment, disillusioned stakeholders, and missed opportunities.
Why does this gap persist—and more importantly, how can enterprises bridge it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is no longer just a buzzword—it's rapidly becoming a hands-on collaborator in the software development lifecycle. With AWS introducing Agentic AI capabilities through services like Agents for Amazon Bedrock, developers now have intelligent assistants that don’t just generate code, but understand workflows, take context-aware actions, and interact with services—all based on natural language prompts.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how Agentic AI on AWS is shaping the future of coding and how developers can start using it today.
What is Agentic AI?
On AWS, this is enabled through Agents for Amazon Bedrock, where developers can build and deploy agents that:
Understand goals through prompts or APIs
Use built-in tools or custom functions
Call AWS services (like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
Generate intelligent, contextual responses
How Is Agentic AI Useful for Developers?
🔧1. Automate Repetitive DevOps Tasks
🧠 2. Context-Aware Code Generation
⚙️ 3. Smart API Orchestration
Creating an S3 bucket
Uploading files
Notifying users on completion
All with a single prompt or API call.
🔍 4. Real-Time Troubleshooting Assistant
📈 5. Streamline Business Logic
Real Example:Build an Agent for DevOps Tasks
Accepts a prompt like: "Deploy a test environment in us-east-1 with EC2 and RDS"
Invokes backend Lambda functions
Deploys infrastructure via CloudFormation or SDK
Responds with a success or error message
With just a few lines of configuration and access to your functions, it acts like a smart DevOps engineer.
How to Get Started 
Enable Amazon Bedrock in your AWS account.
Define an Agent using the AWS console or CLI.
Create Action Groups to link your backend Lambda functions.
Secure your agent with IAM permissions.
Invoke via API or UI—from your app, CLI, or test UI.
Final Thoughts
So go ahead—build your first agent. Your new coding buddy is waiting.]]></summary>

I’m currently working on building profile authority through smart SEO strategies  both for my own projects and clients. I wanted to share a few practical tips that are often overlooked but still deliver results in 2025:
✅ Quality over quantity with backlinks  Focus on real engagement and meaningful contributions on forums, Q&A sites, and niche communities.
✅ Internal linking matters — It's not just about backlinks from other sites. A strong internal link structure helps bots and users navigate your content better.
✅ Write for people, optimize for search  Don’t sacrifice natural flow just for keywords. Google's getting better at detecting authenticity.
✅ Community participation  passive SEO  Places like DEV, Reddit, Quora, or niche forums offer authority-building opportunities without being spammy.
I’d love to hear what’s been working for others in SEO lately — drop your insights or tools in the comments!

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

Let’s look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin price remains stuck.
Bitcoin runs into resistance at $110,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price oscillates within a tight range between $106,600 and $110,700, with no clear directional bias.

The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release.
The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years.
“I’m incredibly proud of our team’s tenacity and focus, which led to quarterly profitability in Q4 2024, a pivotal milestone that confirms the value of our approach,” CEO Franz Bergmueller said.

Telegram is expected to raise at least $1.5 billion in a bond issue on May 28, with support from existing backers like BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported.
As part of the sale, Telegram is offering investors five-year bonds at a 9% yield, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.

In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks says the US could buy more Bitcoin if the government can fund the purchase in a “budget-neutral” way without a tax or adding to the growing national debt.
Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

Guo will face the court on “allegations relating to multiple breaches of his directors’ duties,” the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a May 28 press release.
ASIC alleged Guo made multiple breaches of directors’ duties relating to his dealings with ACX Exchange customer funds, and claimed he made false and misleading statements about those dealings and failed to maintain proper books and records. 
The now-liquidated Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from mid-2016 until December 2019, when it collapsed as customers could no longer withdraw their assets.

“They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. 
“I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nasdaq has filed for crypto asset manager 21Shares to list a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, initiating the Securities and Exchange Commission’s review process.
The stock market’s May 23 19b-4 filing, which asks the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, follows 21Shares’ April 30 submission of its S-1 registration statement to the SEC, which asked the regulator to approve trading of the proposed fund.
Both regulatory filings are needed for the Sui (SUI) tracking fund to go live, with the 19b-4 filing kicking off the SEC’s review process. The agency must decide whether to accept, reject or delay the application within 45 days and it can delay its decision multiple times, for a maximum review period of 240 days.
The SEC must decide on 21Shares’ application by Jan. 18, 2026, at the…]]></summary>

33-year-old William Duplessie was taken into custody by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and will be charged with “kidnapping and false imprisonment of an associate,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
The incident comes amid a string of kidnappings and ransom attempts targeting crypto investors and their loved ones, prompting additional security measures from investors and industry executives.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.
According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. 
He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time…]]></summary>

In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said:
“We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions."

According to a May 27 announcement, the strategies will include buying undervalued biotech companies, purchasing “distressed Bitcoin claims” like those associated with crypto hacks and bankruptcies, and acquiring bottom tranches of Bitcoin credit vehicles at discounted prices. 
“ [...] our alpha-generating Bitcoin accumulation strategies are designed to drive sustained outperformance relative to Bitcoin itself, which requires a new valuation framework,” Strive CEO Matt Cole said.
