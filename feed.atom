        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the DOM?
The DOM is a programming interface provided by the browser that represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects. Each element in an HTML document becomes a node (object) in this tree. JavaScript can use the DOM to access and manipulate HTML and CSS.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>My Page</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="title">Hello, DOM!</h1>
  </body>

let heading = document.getElementById("title");
heading.textContent = "Welcome to JavaScript DOM!";


What Does the HTML DOM Look Like?
Imagine your webpage as a tree
The document is the root.
HTML tags like , 
, and  are branches.

Attributes, text, and other elements are the leaves.
Why is DOM Required?
Dynamic Content Updates: Without reloading the page, the DOM allows content updates (e.g…]]></summary>

Did AI kill the tech interview?
Truth is hiring and interviewing have been broken for years. There wasn't much left to kill.
In over 10 years, I've witnessed all types of interviews: casual conversations, interrogation-like conversations with rapid-fire questions, take-home coding exercises, and the infamous LeetCode exercises.
I asked Phind and Copilot to solve an interview exercise. I might or might not have been asked that exercise when applying to a FAANG.
Here's the "made-up" problem:
You're given a string containing the words "one" and "two", and the symbols "+" and "-" representing a math expression. Write a C# function called "Evaluate" to evaluate that expression after replacing "one" with 1 and "two" with 2. Assume the underlying expressi…]]></summary>

It started, as these things always do, with a Slack message from support that began:

"This is probably nothing, but…"
It never is.
Turns out a customer had requested a refund for a $0 order—paid entirely with a promotional code that someone in marketing named “YOLO100.” Our system, ever obedient, generated a pristine digital refund for exactly zero currency units and confidently shoved it into the payment gateway, which replied with the transactional equivalent of a raised eyebrow:

"Invalid amount."
From there, the trail of confusion expanded outward like a suburban sprawl. Engineering said it shouldn’t be possible. QA said it wasn’t in the test cases. Product said it was “an edge case.” (They always say that, don’t they? Every single cliff we fall off was once c…]]></summary>

Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are the new crypto darling.
Everyone’s hyped: BlackRock’s onchain, treasuries are getting wrapped, and traditional finance is flirting hard with blockchain.
But let’s not get it twisted: RWAs aren’t decentralization. They’re TradFi in a blockchain costume.
Here’s the inconvenient truth:
Want to buy tokenized real estate? Great. But that token doesn’t give you squat unless a legal entity off-chain honors it.
Treasury tokens? Same thing. You’re trusting a fund manager, custodian, or regulatory body to redeem it.
It’s not trustless. It’s regulatory theater with a smart contract backend.
RWAs are less about empowering users and more about navigating global compliance.
It’s not about breaking the system. It’s about bending the rules just enough to extract value while pretending to be futuristic.
This isn’t DeFi. It’s just TradFi with faster accounting.
Let’s be honest: most RWA projects don’t need a blockchain. They use it for:
Token issuance
Cap table management
Tracking asset flow
But these are things spreadsheets and CRMs have done for decades.
Putting it onchain doesn’t make it revolutionary — it just makes it buzzword-compliant.
Web3 wasn’t about rehypothecating bonds or making banks more efficient. It was about disintermediation.
Cutting out the middlemen. Giving power back to users. Trustless systems.
RWAs? They reintroduce the middlemen — they just wear hoodies now.
Tokenized RWAs sound sexy, but they’re just Wall Street playing dress-up in Web3.
Until these assets are truly decentralized — not just onchain — they’ll remain more TradFi than DeFi.]]></summary>

The first thing I learned is that SEO is really Really REALLY complicated. The second thing I learned is that it's complicated because of developers.
