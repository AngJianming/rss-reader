        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Summary

Early adopters of the Nintendo Switch 2 had their big launch-night moment ruined when GameStop employees at a Staten Island location stapled purchase receipts directly onto the console boxes—puncturing delicate screens through the thin cardboard and plastic packaging. Dozens of fans shared photos on Twitter and Reddit showing staple holes in their brand-new units, sparking frustration over both the retailer’s careless handling and Nintendo’s apparently minimal internal protection for its flagship device.
What’s Next?

IGN reached out to GameStop and Nintendo, and a GameStop spokesperson has since pledged to “make customers whole.” Meanwhile, gamers are warning friends to inspect their consoles immediately and retailers to rethink receipt practices—because no one wants their $500 gaming machine to double as a pin cushion.]]></summary>

According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta is in talks with Disney and indie studio A24 to lock down streaming rights—think timed or full exclusives—for a glasses-like AR/VR device codenamed “Loma” (rumored to be the lightweight “Puffin” successor to Quest 3). The kit pairs sleek eyewear with a pocketable compute puck, positioning itself between the $300 Quest line and Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro.
Beyond chasing star power, Meta’s hardware boss Andrew “Boz” Bosworth reminds us that prototypes are plenty and plans can change. But if Loma lands, it’ll undercut Vision Pro’s sticker while leaning heavily on fresh or exclusive content as its killer app.]]></summary>

With its silicon monopoly sending ripples through the entire industry, TSMC is ramping up capacity (even its new US plants are already bursting with orders) while staying laser-focused on matching supply to real-world needs rather than picking sides in the AI showdown.]]></summary>

Set in a world run by tech billionaires and next-level AI, the movie spins a globe-shaking deepfake incident in Asia into chaos, power plays and fake realities.
Though folks are calling it “Succession-ish,” Carell stresses it’s darker and crazier—more of a modern-day Dr. Strangelove than a family-dynasty saga. He finds its chillingly plausible tech timeline terrifying, but appreciates Jesse Armstrong’s knack for slipping in sharp laughs to break the tension.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: This is a story of my journey through CSS solutions. Which led to my personal opinion that simpler tools often work better than complex abstractions. CSS-in-JS, zero-runtime CSS-in-JS, and Tailwind all taught me valuable lessons, but they all added build complexity that eventually became more trouble than benefit. And I eventually returned back to CSS Modules for a better maintainability and simplicity.
I started my web development journey the traditional way years back—HTML, CSS and JS in separate files. When I learned React, I kept the same approach without exploring the solutions ecosystem much. I'd create a .css file, import it into my .jsx file, and split stylesheets as they grew.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Life moves fast. Your thoughts shouldn’t.
College life is a rollercoaster — assignments, deadlines, social pressure, plans, and that constant buzzing in your brain. In the middle of all that noise, finding a moment to pause, reflect, and breathe can feel impossible. That’s exactly why we created Bloomlog.
Bloomlog is a micro-journaling app designed for real life. No long entries, no pressure to be poetic. Just one minute a day to check in with yourself and grow a little every time.
You’ll get:
A simple daily prompt (like “What made you smile today?”)
A quick mood check-in

Optional voice journaling (soon, we’ll even call you to reflect — literally)
It’s not another productivity app. It’s your safe, quiet space to express yourself.
Because habits grow from small wins. Research shows that trying to “overhaul your life” usually fails, but adding a tiny, daily ritual? That sticks.
Whether you’re between classes or brushing your teeth, you can open Bloomlog, answer one thoughtful question, and be done in 60 seconds. Over time, those little reflections become powerful.
You’re a college student trying to stay sane while juggling everything
You’re someone who’s into mindfulness, but meditation feels hard
You’ve t*ried journaling before*, but couldn’t keep up
📲 How to Get Started
👉 Join the Waitlist
Feel better. Think clearer. One minute at a time.
Welcome to Bloomlog — where small thoughts lead to big changes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why do we install productivity or mindfulness apps, excitedly believing they’ll finally help us get our lives together, only to abandon them after a day or two?
We start motivated. The app seems perfect: sleek design, great reviews, maybe a friend even recommended it. Day one feels promising; we’re tracking habits, logging mindfulness sessions, and feeling genuinely productive or at peace. Day two, we continue enthusiastically, proud of our small victories.
But by day three, something shifts. Our excitement fades. Checking the app feels like a chore rather than a helpful ritual. Notifications become annoyances rather than gentle nudges. By day six, the app feels foreign — just another neglected icon cluttering our phone screen. We uninstall, wondering why it didn’t work this time.
The truth? No app on the market truly understands why we struggle to build lasting habits. Most apps assume motivation stays constant or that we have ample free time and mental energy every day. They fail to meet us where we are — in our messy, unpredictable, and busy lives.
Simply making a choice look easier is a Nudge in itself. One step less? It is often enough to influence our decision due to our tendency to conserve energy, also known as laziness.

That’s why we built our app — to finally provide a mindful, minimalistic, and genuinely effective solution. An app designed not just for day one or two, but for day three, day six, and beyond. Because real change happens gently, sustainably, and over time.
Stay tuned. We’re launching soon, and this time, your habit will stick.
