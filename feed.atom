        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent AI systems are transforming how intelligent applications are built. By orchestrating multiple specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks, these systems enable more dynamic and efficient workflows. However, deploying such a system reliably and at scale requires a structured approach to testing, packaging, and automation.
In this tutorial, you will walk through the process of building, testing, and deploying a multi-agent AI system using LangGraph, Docker, AWS Lambda, and CircleCI. You will develop a research-driven AI workflow where different agents,such as fact-checking, summarization, and search agents, work together seamlessly. You will package this application into a Docker container, deploy it to AWS Lambda, and automate the entire pipeline using CircleCI.

Some documentation does a great job of explaining all the features of a product. But that’s all they do. It’s obvious they didn’t consider how users might actually interact with the product. Their goal was simply to write as much product information as possible, without bothering to ask how the user might need to use their product or how that should influence the design and development of the documentation.

Let me walk you through how I built it and what it does.
This counter app displays a number (starting from 0) and provides three buttons:
➕ Increase: Adds 1 to the counter

➖ Decrease: Subtracts 1 from the counter

🔁 Reset: Resets the counter back to 0
