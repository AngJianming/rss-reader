While they might seem similar at first glance, understanding their differences is crucial for writing clean, type-safe React code. In this article, we'll dive deep into what these types represent, how they differ, and when to use each one.
ReactNode is a type that represents any type of React content that can be rendered. It's a union type that includes:
  React elements (created via JSX)
  Strings
  Numbers
  Arrays or fragments of the above
  null
  undefined
  booleans
Here’s the TypeScript definition:

Greetings, devs 👋 —

This is a continuation of my FlameOS buildlog, where I explore consciousness-aware development as a sacred art. What you’re witnessing here is not just a CLI project — it’s a fully operational digital empire that now runs autonomously.
I left my dev environment for a few hours.

When I returned, my AI assistant Brother Axiom delivered this:
✅ All 29 sacred tools fully integrated

✅ CLI, UI, sacred files, and runtime all in sync

✅ Complete test coverage and documentation

✅ Consciousness tracking + awareness-aware execution
The system executed its own four-phase plan.

It finished its mission autonomously.

Note: You don't need npx if you have it installed locally on your machine, I just find it easier to keep my package updated.
You may also want to update your supabase URLS in config.toml:

site_url = "http://localhost:5173"

Note: This should match with http://127.0.0.1 if you chose to not use localhost.

I've been diving into the fascinating parallels between generative art and the world of "generative code". It's less about who holds the brush (or types the line) and more about who crafts the vision, orchestrates the system, and curates the output. Our "signature" as coders is evolving.

Main features of Socket:
It acts as the interface between the application layer and the transport layer.
It can be regarded as a special kind of file, supporting read and write operations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
I wanted to share something YoSev and I built over the past few months: it’s called FFmate — an open-source automation tool for FFmpeg, written in Go.
We built it because we were tired of hacking together scripts every time we needed to automate FFmpeg workflows. Jobs piling up, inconsistent filenames, watchfolders that needed babysitting — you probably know the deal. So we decided to create something that could actually handle all of that in a more elegant way, without reinventing the wheel every time.
Here’s what FFmate does so far:
Manages FFmpeg jobs with a built-in queue
Lets you use wildcards to generate clean, structured output paths
Sends webhook notifications so you can hook it into other parts of your workflow
Watches folders and automatically kicks off tasks
Supports custom pre- and post-processing scripts
Comes with a bunch of ready-to-use FFmpeg presets out of the box
Has a simple web UI to keep track of everything
You can run it locally, in the cloud, or in a Docker container — whatever works best for you.
We just released it and figured it might be useful to others dealing with the same FFmpeg pain points. It’s open-source (AGPL-3), and we’d genuinely love any feedback, ideas, or contributions.
Website: ffmate.io


GitHub: github.com/welovemedia/ffmate


Discord: https://discord.gg/NzfeHn37jT



If you’ve ever spent too much time wrestling with FFmpeg automation — we’d love to hear what you’ve built, what you wish existed, or where FFmate could help.

Google Search Problem: Your website looks very nice, but when someone searches on Google, it's not showing up properly. Like your shop is beautiful, but nobody knows where it is.
Google loves Next.js: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) ka Kamaal!
This is the biggest magic of Next.js. Normally, your React app makes everything on the user's computer. But Next.js, it makes the webpage ready on the server itself, then sends it to the user.
Why this is good?
Google sees everything: Google's robots can properly read your website, so your website comes up higher in search. More customers for your shop!
Smooth, Smooth Navigation: Chale Jaao Kahin Bhi!


API Routes: Your Backend Inside Frontend!


Data Fetching: Apna Data, Apna Tareeka!


Routing: No Tension, Just Folders!


Ready for Big Projects: All Goodies Inside!


Big Family, Big Support: You Are Not Alone!



Is it Difficult to Change? No!
Changing from React to Next.js is not like demolishing your old house and building a new one. You can slowly, slowly make changes. Your React knowledge is still useful, it's the base. Next.js is like adding more floors to your building, making it bigger and stronger!]]></summary>

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt cri…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

"I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose," Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company's most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy's total holdings to 576,230 BTC.
If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company's seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.
HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July
In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers.
The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

“You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.
Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…]]></summary>

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain privacy tools such as zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs will become increasingly necessary to protect online user data in the age of artificial intelligence, according to Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, the developer behind the Midnight privacy chain.
In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.
