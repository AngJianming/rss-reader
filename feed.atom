        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integrating Semantic Kernel into ASP.NET applications is straightforward, due to built-in support for Dependency Injection (DI). This makes well-known features such as configuration, logging, and hosting trivial to use for AI Agent development. However, while debugging an agent issue, I discovered that all logging information from the Semantic Kernel was missing! This article explains issue's root cause and how to fix it.
Here is a simplified version of the code I used to set up and use the Semantic Kernel in my ASP.NET application. Please note how IChatCompletionService and Kernel services are registered within DI container.
We use Agent to complete a chat based on user's prompt. All dependencies are injected into the Agent constructor automatically.
After detecting an unrelated issue in request processing, I turned to good old console logs to find the root cause. To my surprise, I noticed no logging information was generated by the Kernel.

At first, I thought it was a configuration issue. But no matter how I configured the logging, nor what scope I set, the Kernel information was missing from the console. I even tried to set the logging level to Debug or Verbose, but nothing worked.
It turned out that the issue was not in the Kernel itself, but in the way how underlying AzureOpenAIChatCompletionService was created. Even though the _kernel instance was used to call GetChatMessageContentAsync() method of IChatCompletionService, logging provider registered in DI container was not used. The solution was to provide it during registration of the AzureOpenAIChatCompletionService instance.
And whoila! Now we can see the debug information in the console!

Even though the Semantic Kernel is designed to work with DI, it does not mean other parts of .NET AI stack are. However, in this case, the solution was simple. Just make sure to pass the logging factory to the IChatCompletionService implementation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schema-First: The Unsung Hero of Vibe Coding


Last Friday's AI workshop revealed an approach that genuinely caught my attention. After building systems for decades, I've seen countless methodologies come and go, but my colleague's presentation of a vibe-coded medical appointment scheduling system demonstrated something rare: perfect synchronization between frontend and backend components despite rapid development cycles.
What stood out wasn't the polished UI or time it took to occur—it was how locked-in every part of the application was. When he revealed the how it was simply: "Schema-first, with zero exceptions."
What struck me most was how this approach enhanced rather than restricted their "vibe coding" style. While they maintained the intuitive, developer-experience-focused approach that makes coding enjoyable, the schema provided guardrails that prevented chaos. Of course this has always been the case - to build a house you put up a foundation first - but in our hope to nail it all together with one prompt, one shot, we've forgotten how to do layer upon layer upon solid foundations.
I left that workshop with a renewed appreciation for architectural fundamentals. In our rush to embrace developer experience and intuition-driven approaches, we sometimes forget that structure enables creativity rather than hindering it. The lesson wasn't that vibe coding is wrong—it's that vibe coding becomes exponentially more powerful when built on a foundation of well-defined schemas and interfaces.
As I tried this approach on subsequent projects, the results confirm what I witnessed that Friday: architecture still matters, perhaps more than ever. The sweet spot isn't choosing between rigid structure and creative freedom—it's recognizing how the right structure creates the perfect playground for innovation.]]></summary>

When you power up Sim800l, if you see led on module blinks every 1 seconds it mean connection has problem and i found in most of cases its because of power supply. when it blinks every 3 seconds, its ok and connected.

Recently, I came across a well-structured breakdown of crypto corporate exchange accounts, and it’s a topic worth sharing with any developer, startup, or business founder exploring crypto integration.
🏢 What Are Crypto Corporate Accounts?
In simple terms, these are business-level accounts on centralized exchanges like WhiteBIT, Coinbase, or Binance, built for companies rather than individuals. Think of it like the difference between a personal Instagram and a business profile — more tools, more flexibility, and tailored for operations.

These accounts enable businesses to:
Separate personal and company crypto activity
Access institutional-level liquidity and higher limits
Automate and manage crypto-based payments to contractors, employees, or customers

🔑 Key Features of Corporate Exchange Accounts
Multi-user access with granular role permissions
Higher transaction thresholds
Advanced analytics & reporting tools
Dedicated account managers/support
KYC/KYB-compliant onboarding
Access to over-the-counter (OTC) services on some platforms
If you're building or advising on a crypto-native product — whether it’s a DeFi protocol, a payment solution, or NFT platform — understanding corporate account infrastructure is critical.
It allows you to:
Architect systems that connect to real-world liquidity
Guide clients through onboarding to major exchanges
Build enterprise-ready tools that play by the rules

At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.
In the case, Judge Michael O’Connell of Victoria ruled that Bitcoin qualifies as a form of money rather than property, likening the digital asset to Australian dollars rather than to shares, gold or foreign currency.

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

Bitcoin dropped over 4.5% on May 19, confirming a bearish divergence and threatening a break below $100,000.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. 

A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 4.5% from its intraday high on May 19, falling to around $102,000 in its worst daily drop in over a month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18.
Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

According to a May 16 letter from Storm's attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a "money transmitting business" and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023.
Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.

According to Durov, a Western European government, which he hinted at with a baguette emoji, approached the platform and requested it censor conservative voices, which he flatly denied. Durov wrote in a May 18 Telegram post:
"You can't 'defend democracy' by destroying democracy. You can’t 'fight election interference' by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both."
