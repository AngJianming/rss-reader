Bitcoin (BTC) is at its highest levels since January, and traders are eyeing key levels to watch for what’s next.

After hitting $104,000, BTC/USD is retracing to establish support, but the fate of $100,000 is among the concerns for market participants.

Current price action represents an important battleground, as measured from the $75,000 lows this year.


” Headline driven” BTC price gains draw scrutiny
Just $6,000 from new all-time highs, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC price action has stunned the market by jumping 10% in days.
The pace of the BTC price gains has come as a surprise for many, but longer-term perspectives show where the most difficult battleground lies.

Large-scale frontend applications, like those seen in enterprise or SaaS platforms, demand thoughtful architecture, robust tooling, and clear conventions.
Here are battle-tested strategies to ensure your large frontend codebase remains sustainable and efficient:
A clear folder structure and separation of concerns can drastically improve maintainability.

But more often than not we have a need for generating and self-managing these Encryption keys, that maybe due to multiple reasons, maybe to enable/disable rotation period, have full access to key metadata and logs (or  perhaps the need to assert your dominance on AWS ;). 
So firstly how do these encryption keys work:
When we create a key (CMK) in AWS it generates a 256-bit AES key in a FIPS 140-2 validated HSM. This key never leaves the HSM for security.
Now when we want to encrypt any data AWS doesn't directly use the CMK for encyption as that would either have to be done in the secure environment or you have to expose the CMK to a insecure environment. So here com…]]></summary>

But what if the secret to a radiant complexion lies not in your bathroom cabinet, but on your plate? Emerging research and age-old wisdom both suggest that the food you eat plays a significant role in the health and appearance of your skin. So, can your diet really affect your skin? The short answer: absolutely. But the long answer is more nuanced—and fascinating.

Routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages or views in a single-page application (SPA) without reloading the entire page.
It keeps the UI in sync with the current browser URL.
Allows us to build Single Page Applications (SPA).
React apps are SPAs, meaning there's only one HTML file (index.html), but multiple views (pages) that users can navigate to. Routing helps manage these views by matching the URL to the correct component.
It enables client-side navigation without full-page reloads, allowing users to move smoothly between URLs like /home, /about, or /contact, each displaying different components.
React doesn’t have built-in routing, so we use a library like React Router (react-router-dom) for handling routing.

If you’ve ever participated in one, you’ve probably felt it: the clock ticking, rankings shifting in real time, and your own rules starting to blur.
In my recent publication, I outlined how tournaments push traders to sharpen strategies and risk management. But let’s be honest: even well-prepared traders often lose their edge not because of bad charts — but because of bad reactions.
Inspired by the article Strategy, Stress & Survival: Mastering Yourself in Trading Competitions, I'd like to disclose why it happens — and what you can do to avoid joining the wreckage pile.
Pressure rewires your brain
It often happens unconsciously. You don’t “decide” to tilt — you slide into it.
Strategy means nothing without composure
How to protect your edge under pressure
Trading competitions are more than just high-volatility showcases — they’re a mirror. A good one shows you your edge. A great one shows you where you lose it.

Think of a document (draft, under review, published), an order (new, paid, shipped, delivered), or as we'll explore, a student moving through academic stages.
However, with the advancement of programming and the complexity of the problems we face, we discovered that every object has two types of attributes: static attributes and state attributes , which will be the focus of our discussion now. Because these attributes have behavior and state rather than a fixed value, dealing with them can be complex. Changing an object's state may result in a change in its behavior.

It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT), Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
"Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. 
“People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the …]]></summary>

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

Brogan told Cointelegraph that the specific mechanism to exempt capital gains taxes outlined in HB 594 is unique and compared it to a similar income tax deduction in the federal tax code. The attorney explained:
