My usage of Home Assistant required external access from the beginning.
I achieved it in two steps:
I created a subdomain of frankel.ch, which pointed to my router's external IP.
On my router, I opened a dedicated port. In turn, the router forwarded requests to my HA.
The next action was to secure connections via an SSL certificate. I initially aimed for mTLS, but I couldn't achieve it because the iPhone HA application doesn't support it. However, encrypted communication to my server was a hard requirement.
The good news is that the times when SSL certificates were a luxury feature are gone. Let's Encrypt makes them available to everybody for free.

The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. 
Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.
This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.

Yeah. That was me with CI/CD.
Back when I earned a bit of cred at work, I used to “delegate” repo management and CI/CD. I say “delegate” because, honestly, I was just bad at it. The jargon, the layers of abstraction; it was all so damn annoying.
And if that’s not wild enough, I once tried to sit through a one-hour DevOps tutorial… and woke up at the 45-minute mark 😔
Eventually, I forced myself to think about CI/CD like a developer. And guess what? It’s stupid simple.
CI/CD is just... functions. Yep. Just functions. Let me show you.

A discussion on digital property rights, copyright, intellectual property, the open metaverse, AI and value without physical form.
When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.
Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions.

Bean 的创建方式
Bean 之间依赖注入（wiring）
这两种不同维度问题。
在 Spring 框架中，Bean 是由 Spring 容器管理的基本对象。可以通过以下三种主要方式创建 Bean：
@Component 注解


通过在类上添加 @Component 注解，Spring 会自动扫描并将该类注册为一个 Bean。这种方式适用于直接定义一个类作为 Bean 的场景。
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class UserService {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello from UserService!");
    }
}

特点：简单直接，适合业务逻辑类。
使用场景：当类是独立的、具有明确职责的组件时。
注意：需要确保 @ComponentScan 开启，且类在扫描路径内。
@Bean 注解在配置类中定义


在 @Configuration 注解的配置类中，通过 @Bean 注解定义方法返回值作为 Bean。这种方式适合需要自定义 Bean 实例化逻辑的场景。
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

The equivalence grouping and none equivalence grouping we discussed earlier have not paid attention to this issue, and the grouping rules are based on the member values themselves. But if an ordered set is used as the object of operation, the influence of member order on grouping must be considered, and there are many applications of ordered grouping in real business.
Firstly, there is the sequence number grouping.

The money laundering services were allegedly carried out on behalf of other criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking, Europol said in a May 14 statement.
Spanish authorities said the criminal organization ran a secret informal money transfer system called hawala and was often compensated in crypto.
A total of 17 individuals were arrested — 15 in Spain, one in Austria and one in Belgium — while 4.5 million euros ($5 million) worth of items were seized, including cash, crypto, 18 vehicles, four shotguns and several electronic devices.

“For some reason, founders and CEOs think that they should be raising capital at 50 to 80 times revenue. So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14.
“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.”

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. 
The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin's all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. 
From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.
Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post, Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe's crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider:
“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”
