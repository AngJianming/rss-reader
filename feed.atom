        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in the 1960s, when computers were still a relatively new frontier, the term "software engineering" was first coined. The folks developing these early digital systems looked to a well-established field for guidance: civil engineering. They imagined building software much like constructing a bridge or a skyscraper, applying rigorous principles of design, analysis, and construction. This initial comparison profoundly shaped how we first approached creating software.

It made sense, then, that the waterfall model became the go-to approach. Think of it like a meticulous building project: you gather all the requirements, then design, then build, then test, and finally, deploy. Each phase had to be perfectly completed before moving on to the next. This rigid, step-by-step process mirrored th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a Vue developer, learning React initially felt like a step backward. The boilerplate, the dependency arrays, the constant battle with the compiler—it all seemed unnecessarily complex. Vue's intuitive reactivity system just clicked with my mental model of how code should work. And when I discovered Svelte, with its elegant runes system, I found something even better.
But here's the thing: React isn't going anywhere. It's become the de facto standard for frontend development, backed by Meta and boasting the largest ecosystem of tools, libraries, and job opportunities. Theo explains this dynamic well in his video:




While I've grown more comfortable with React's patterns, I still find myself longing for Svelte's simplicity. There's something beautiful about how Svelte lets you write exac…]]></summary>

A Estrutura do Projeto
Para manter o código organizado, dividi a lógica em três partes principais:
1. authRoutes.ts: Define os endpoints /register e /login. Sua única responsabilidade é direcionar as requisições para o controller correto.
2. authController.ts: Contém a regra de negócio. É aqui que validamos os dados, interagimos com o banco e decidimos qual resposta enviar.
3. utils/auth.ts (Abstrato): Funções complementares para hashear senhas e gerar tokens, para não repetirmos código. Achei que ficou mais organizado …]]></summary>

Today was such a refreshing break from my regular routine – I attended a Design Mixer, and damn, it was way more fun than I expected!

The day kicked off with introductions. Our group had around 15 people, and it was incredible to see how diverse the crowd was. 

From UX researchers to product designers, visual artists to students like me, everyone brought in their own flavor of creativity. 

It felt like I was in a room full of stories, ideas, and passion for design.
After the ice-breaking session, we took a short lunch break, and yes, we all had some pizza 🍕 – always a mood booster.
Post-lunch, things got even more exciting. We had a design competition, and the prompt I got was so wholesome – design an app for a grandparent to choose a gift for their grandchild. 

I loved the concept, and sketching out ideas while thinking from the perspective of both generations was a fun challenge. 
The vibes were friendly yet focused, and it was heartwarming to see how everyone approached their unique prompts.
To wrap up the day, I squeezed in some basic DSA questions – just to keep the logical side of my brain running.
A perfect balance of design and logic, honestly.

I have successfully enhanced my M365 auto-responder with conditional logic in my previous posts. Today, I am further elevating my automation process by integrating Microsoft Teams notifications, ensuring real-time alerts for specific email triggers.
By the completion of this project, I shall be having Outlook mailbox, Power Automate, SharePoint, and Teams all configured into a product meant to enhance productivity in the business space.
Mission: Send Teams Notifications for Urgent Emails
✅ 1. Set Up a Microsoft Teams Workflows
 Create a Teams Channel: If you haven't already, create a dedicated channel in Microsoft Teams for notifications.

 Add an Incoming Workflows:
Hover your mouse on the created channel, and on the three horizontal dots that appear at the far right of the channel's name, click for more options, and choose the workflows option



In the second part of this project, remember that I created a flows in Power Automate called, "Email Automation", this comes up when I click the "view all flows" button.

Click on the "Email Automate" flows and save. Also, note that the connection is successful.


✅ 2. Update the Configured Flows Power Automate
 Add a New Step: After sending the auto-reply for urgent emails, add a "Microsoft Teams" connector then, "Post message in a chat or channel" action .



 Input the required parameters and save the updated flows configuration. Note that you can dynamically add the mailbox of the sender and the mail subject into the body of the message to be sent to the Teams channel.

✅ 3. Test and Validate
 Confirm that:
The appropriate auto-reply is sent.
A new entry is logged in SharePoint.
A notification appears in the designated Teams channel.]]></summary>

There are 3 basic steps (1- create a input action prefixed with IA_; 2- create a input mapping context that will use the previously created IA, prefixed with IMC_; and last but not least, 3- in script, C++ or blueprint, set the IMC to be used in the player controller).
1- Create a Input Action. E.g., IA_FireLaser

This IA is used as a boolean value (ON or OFF) to indicate if should fire weapon if user is pressing a mouse button or keyboard key.

2- Create a Input Mapping Acton. E.g., IMC_Player

This IMC binds left mouse button and Z key to this fire event.

3- In script (C++ or blueprint) on begin play event:

And finally,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey devs! 👋
Just tried something seriously cool I wanted to share: the new VEO-3 model on PicoAI just dropped, and it's 🔥.
I’ve been exploring AI video generation tools for a while now — you know, experimenting with Runway, Kaiber, even some stuff on Gemini by Google — but this one caught me by surprise. VEO-3 generates both video and audio from prompts, and the quality is seriously impressive.
What I loved:
⚡️ No need for Gemini or extra setup — just go to 

🗣️ Audio is included — like, actual synced soundtracks or voice clips tied to your video scenes.

🎨 Creative control — you can tweak prompts to get stylized results, realistic scenes, or more experimental outputs.

Here’s a sneak peek of what I made in under 10 minutes:
I’m not affiliated with them or anything — just stumbled on it while browsing and had a great experience. It’s kind of wild to see how accessible this stuff is becoming. Definitely worth checking out if you're into generative AI, creative tools, or even just curious how far these models have come lately.
picoai.app and start generating.
Let me know if you try it! Would love to see what others create with it.
—
Happy creating,
Carlo Gammarota]]></summary>

They allow your JavaScript code to respond to user actions, such as clicks, keyboard input, or page loading. In this post, we'll explore what event listeners are, the different types, and how to use them effectively.  
What Are Event Listeners?


An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event (like a click or keypress) to occur on a DOM element. When the event happens, the listener executes a callback function, enabling dynamic and interactive behavior.  
Common Types of Events


Here are some frequently used events in JavaScript:  
Mouse Events

mouseover / mouseout – When the mouse enters or leaves an element.
