📝 Introduction to HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's the building block of all websites. Before you can style a site with CSS or add interactivity with JavaScript, you need to understand how to structure content with HTML.
When I began learning web development at @devsync, I had no idea where to start. Thanks to the structured training, mentorship, and live coding sessions at devsync.in, I quickly understood the core concepts and began building real websites.
💡 What is HTML?
HTML is not a programming language, it's a markup language. It uses tags to define different elements of a webpage.
Some of the first tags I learned during my @devsync training were:

now everyone's here, relatives i dont know names of, people i have never seen, the house crowded and my paternal aunt's crying their hearts out whereas me and my sister, we didnt shed not even a single drop of tear. but its so sad, that as soon as her body was taken for cremation they started laughing, discussing how they got ready on their marriage day and how slim they were. then wasn't it better to show no remorse of grandma's death than faking tears out. losing your mother is such a deep ocean of feeling, how can a difference of one hour make you forget that?
nevertheless the day went on, we didnt eat much but enough, enough to survive the day. everyone left but two of my three aunts stayed the night. we slept in our mother's room, and my father in grandmother's, rituals.
i found out the internship was a scam and i have lost my 4k. i am planing for a chargeback on the money. it was an expensive lesson. the scammers these days. indians dont study and get smart for the betterment but to scam people and get their money. two tragedy in a day. god must be really tired from my behavior these days.
im tired. thank you.

🤯 What if your problem was never laziness…
We’ve all been there.
You open your editor — and just stare.
A bug from yesterday still lingers.
You’ve been pushing late nights, endless context-switching, and shipping under pressure.
And when your mind and body finally say “no more”, you don’t feel tired.

But here’s the truth:
You weren’t lazy.
exhausted from solving everything alone.
Here’s the kicker: even the most basic code functions don’t run in isolation.
Think about .map().
[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * 2)
// → [2, 4, 6]

It asks for help — from a function you give it.
delegating.
That’s how most of code works:
Frameworks abstract the hard stuff
Helpers reduce repetition
Collaboration makes ideas real faster
So… why do we expect ourselves to work alone 24/7?
Being a dev often means:
Wearing multiple hats (frontend/backend/devops/docs/client support…)
Learning while building
Debugging alone at 2:43 AM
Saying “I got it” when you don’t
This “solo hero” mindset creates guilt when we stop —
Because if we confuse burnout for personal failure,
break.
Actually Looks Like


Asking for help doesn’t mean you’re incapable.
like a dev — efficiently.
✅ You ask a teammate to pair-program for 20 minutes
useEffect with a custom hook someone already made
These aren’t weaknesses. They’re strategies.
It’s not cheating.
If your brain is foggy, if your body’s done,
You’ve just reached a limit — and limits are data.
So pause.
Because the moment you ask for help isn’t when you fail.
It’s when you start scaling.

How can I better prepare?

🌟 Inspiration
With this one opportunity, I wanted to create a visual storytelling experience that doesn’t just look beautiful but also resonates emotionally with anyone who views it. Through simple CSS art, images, and animations, I aimed to showcase the spirit of these festivals in a user-friendly and emotionally compelling way.
💻 Demo

📸 Screenshot:
https://github.com/anilgadhe/Celebrate-June/blob/main/public/covers/landingpage.png
🎨 Journey
What I Did:
Structure: Each festival has its own section or subpage, styled with full-screen images, smooth scroll animations, and rich colors.
Animations: Used IntersectionObserver for fade-in effects and custom keyframe animations for elements like rain and trees.
No card UI: Purposefully kept it immersive—using background images and full-width sections to narrate each story.
Emotion + Culture: From the sacred banyan tree on Vat Purnima to the joy of the first monsoon, every detail is handpicked to invoke sentiment.
What I Learned:
CSS and animation can emotionally engage users without overwhelming them.
Accessibility, color contrast, and responsive design were all important in ensuring everyone can experience this on any device.
