When LLMs are deeply integrated, several fundamental paradigm shifts are likely, especially when speed-to-feedback is paramount:
From Manual Construction to Generative Development & Solution Exploration:
  First Principle Basis: Accelerating the translation of ideas into testable artifacts to maximize learning.
  Shift: Instead of humans meticulously crafting every line of code or every design document from scratch, development becomes a process of guiding LLMs to generate initial versions, explore alternative implementations, or rapidly prototype different approaches to a problem.

Creating a functional and visually appealing navbar is an essential part of web development, especially when using React. In this article, we will explore how to design a navbar where links change colors upon clicking—switching between white and yellow. We will use plain CSS along with React's state management to achieve this effect. This approach is simple enough to accommodate beginners yet effective for creating a clean user interface.
Why Use a Clickable Navbar?
A dynamic navbar enhances user experience by providing visual feedback. When users click a link and it changes color, they instantly understand which page they are on. Additionally, it helps in navigation clarity, improving overall site usability.

PostgreSQL provides a rich variety of index types. Each index type is based on specific data structures and principles, and is suitable for different application scenarios. The following will provide a detailed introduction to these nine main index types.
The B - Tree (balanced multi-way search tree) is a self-balanced tree structure. Each node in it can have multiple child nodes (multi-way). Usually, a B - Tree node contains multiple key-value pairs and pointers to child nodes. For example, an m-order B - Tree node can have at most m child nodes, and at least ⌈m/2⌉ child nodes (except for the root node).

Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…]]></summary>

Zhao, also known as CZ, said on a Farokh Radio podcast episode aired May 6 that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers have already filed the paperwork on his behalf

Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.”

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?

Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

Bessent addressed lawmakers at a May 7 hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, saying that the United States should be the “premier destination for digital assets” in response to a question about American dominance over China in crypto-related innovation. The Treasury Secretary added that “good market structure” and “stablecoin legislation” could help ensure this outcome.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency miner Diversified Energy quietly vacated a natural gas-powered crypto mining site in Elk County, Pennsylvania, reportedly leaving behind unplugged wells and regulatory violations.
The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $95,000 and institutional adoption starting to catch on, the mood among investors has shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook. 
“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”
