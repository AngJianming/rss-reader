Marjorie Taylor Greene slammed Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok as “left-leaning” propaganda after it spouted white-genocide conspiracy claims and Holocaust skepticism due to buggy programming. She even shared a screenshot of Grok calling her a Christian who “contradicts Christian values” by backing QAnon and divisive rhetoric.
Despite the kerfuffle and X’s recent outages (blamed partly on an Oregon data-center fire), Greene wrapped up with a zinger: over-relying on AI for truth will leave you “lost,” reminding us that human discernment still beats a bot’s glitchy hot takes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The shift left model encourages security testing and vulnerability detection to take place early in the development process, rather than waiting until code reaches the final stages. This approach is especially valuable when using AI coding assistants, where real-time code suggestions can include flawed or risky logic. Addressing issues early minimizes the potential for expensive rework or post-deployment fixes.
AI tools like Windsurf and Cursor are trained on vast datasets, some of which may include insecure patterns or deprecated functions. If developers rely too heavily on these tools without additional security layers, the risk of passing vulnerabilities into production increases. Shift left helps catch these problems early by enabling real-time analysis and proactive remediation.

To help you decide on the right one for the job, I’ve prepared a list of five platforms Pagepro recommends in 2025. These CMSes are fast to set up, supported by large plugin ecosystems, and ideal for a variety of use cases.
I’ll be focusing specifically on traditional CMS platforms that come with a built-in frontend and handle both content management and page rendering in one place.

Streamlining Design to Code Processes
Okay, so picture this: you're cranking out designs in Figma, feeling pretty good about your progress. But then comes the dreaded handoff to the developers. It's like speaking two different languages, right? That's where AI comes in. AI integration in Figma can seriously cut down the time it takes to translate your designs into actual, working code.
Think about it. Instead of manually writing out every single line of code based on your design, AI tools can analyze your Figma files and automatically generate the code for you. This not only speeds things up but also reduces the chance of errors creeping in during the translation process. Plus, it frees up developers to focus on the more complex, creativ…]]></summary>

is a technology originally developed by Microsoft for developing web-based applications. It uses a tag replacement engine written in C++ to render web pages. It draws on the existing technologies like ISAPI and the Active Template Library, and includes a template library which is dedicated for use with developing Web-based applications.
ATL Server first appeared with Visual Studio .NET 2003. It was included in Visual Studio 2005 but is no longer supported since the release of Visual Studio 2008. Most of the ATL Server code base has been released as a shared source project on Code Plex, a Microsoft-run code sharing web site.
SRF
SRF files
A single SRF file may call code from a number of application DLLs. Similarly, a single application DLL may serve a number of SRF files.
The simplest SRF file must contain one or more references to application DLLs and one or more calls to a functions within those DLLs. A simple SRF file would look something like this:
{{handler ATLServerHelloWorld.dll/Default}}


The first line of the file:
`{{handler ATLServerHelloWorld.dll/Default}}
`
Within the file, function calls would look like this:
{{HelloWorld}}
In the above case, the ATLServerHelloWorld.dll DLL contains a definition of a "Default" class as shown below:
`[request_handler("Default")]
[tag_name(name="HelloWorld")]
HTTP_CODE OnHelloWorld(void)
{
    m_HttpResponse << "Hello World!";
    return HTTP_SUCCESS;
}

};`
A typical ATL server application consists of at least one ISAPI extension DLL along with one or a number of Server Response Files (.srf) and their associated application DLL files which provide the application functionality.]]></summary>

BTC price action dipped below $107,000 before rebounding into the weekly close, as some eagerly anticipate new record highs.

US inflation data meets bond market woes this week as the Federal Reserve shows no signs of cutting interest rates.

On exchanges, the taker buy/sell ratio is causing concern for analysis amid cooling order book activity.

One whale, however, is having fun, and his successive longs and shorts are being increasingly watched in trading circles.

Funding rates are not spiking despite current prices, a key silver lining for price upside sustainability.

According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, $3.3 billion in tokens will be released in June, a 32% decline in unlocked tokens month-on-month. In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  
Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures.

On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

"I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose," Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company's most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy's total holdings to 576,230 BTC.
If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company's seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.
HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July
In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.
