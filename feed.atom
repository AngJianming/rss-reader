A: Look, I've been doing this for years across probably 20+ different companies, and here's what actually works in the real world. Most places that don't hate their lives use around 5-8 mandatory tags - stuff like CostCenter, Environment, Owner, Project, Application. That's your baseline. Then maybe 3-5 more depending on what kind of weird edge cases your business throws at you.
But seriously, don't be that guy who tries to tag literally everything. I worked at one place where they had a 23-tag minimum. Nobody followed it. Half the tags were garbage. The whole thing was a mess. Stick to tags that solve actual problems you're having right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Odoo, database table names typically follow a straightforward convention: they are the underscored (_) version of the model name as seen in the user interface. For example, the sale.order model corresponds to the sale_order table. However, this pattern isn't always consistent. For instance, you might expect the ir.action.server model to map to the ir_action_server table, but the actual table name is ir_act_server.
This subtle naming quirk can be easy to overlook and may cause confusion when working with Odoo's database. I hope sharing this saves you time if you encounter a similar situation!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! How can you build a beautiful and convenient REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) in Golang?

A brief introduction:
To solve this, I wrote a package (well, a module, but I call them packages) called Replyme — a tool for building REPLs in Golang.
It’s simple!
go get github.com/danyasatsuk/replyme

First, define your REPL session:
app := &replyme.App{
    Name: "mysuperapp",
    Usage: "My awesome application",
    Commands: []*replyme.Command{
        {
            Name: "hello",
            Usage: "Prints `Hello, World!` to the screen",
            Action: func(ctx *replyme.Context) error {
                ctx.Print("Hello, World!")
                return nil
            },
        },
    },
}

Then, launch Replyme:
err := replyme.Run(app)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

That’s it! Well done!
package main

import "github.com/danyasatsuk/replyme"

func main() {
    app := &replyme.App{
        Name: "mysuperapp",
        Usage: "My awesome application",
        Commands: []*replyme.Command{
            {
                Name: "hello",
                Usage: "Prints `Hello, World!` to the screen",
                Action: func(ctx *replyme.Context) error {
                    ctx.Print("Hello, World!")
                    return nil
                },
            },
        },
    }
    err := replyme.Run(app)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}

GitHub link: https://github.com/danyasatsuk/replyme
The project is still in its early development stage, and the stable version is not ready yet. If you encounter any bugs, please create an issue on GitHub and share your feedback!]]></summary>

It worked well for simple projects, and I didn’t think much about architecture back then.
But as my apps became more complex, problems started creeping in. Business logic got tangled up in views, error handling became chaotic, and the separation of concerns practically disappeared. The system functioned, sure — but it felt lifeless. Everything was wired together in a fragile way, and maintaining it became a chore.
As I explored frameworks like Spring Boot and Golang for building web apps, I began to question like 
Why not MVCS — Model, View, Controller, and Service — in Django as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the hardest refactorings to get right is the balance between extract and inlining of functions.
Often people struggle to understand why sometimes when they "do the right thing" and extract a function, their code quality feels like it decreases - this is actually one of my biggest criticisms of Clean Code as a book - it's rife with low quality method extraction.
I think that feeling comes from the weight of "context transference".
Context transference is the amount of information you have to pass between boundaries, and method extraction where 100% of the callers context needs to be transferred for the new function to be meaningful is a poor refactor. You don't reduce any cognitive load - it's a failure of encapsulation.
In object oriented languages this is a more common problem because the context is often scoped to a class, so it's implicit which parts of state are used in any given function, and as a result this transfer of context is equally implicit. 
While it might sound like object scoped state is actually a solution to this problem, it isn't, because the transfer of context is actually the amount of information the programmer has to mentally track during code reading, not the information a computer has to track (because functions exist purely for the programmer) - it's a design time concern and rarely a significant runtime one.
Extraction refactorings should operate on a strict subset of the context of the parent function to be meaningful and not detrimental to reading code, as a general rule.
(Standard disclosure: generalisations include exceptions by default, I'm sure there are many cases where this doesn't apply)]]></summary>
