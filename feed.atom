        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
I’m currently doing some research into how developers and DevOps teams handle application security across the software development lifecycle (SDLC) — from design to deployment.
The goal is to better understand what real-world teams are doing when it comes to:
Security Across These Phases:
Design phase (do you do threat modeling?)


Development/code review (do you run SAST? Get auto-fix suggestions?)


Testing phase (any dynamic/DAST tools, custom logic testing?)


Deployment phase (cloud config checks, misconfig detection?)






What I’d Love to Learn:
How do you currently integrate security into your SDLC?
Do security tools slow you down or help you move faster?
Do you actually use the auto-fix/code suggestions from tools?
What’s the most frustrating thing about your current AppSec setup?
Why I’m Asking:
I'm exploring smarter ways to automate and simplify security across the SDLC — especially for teams without full-time AppSec engineers.
But rather than guess, I want to hear how you work:
What’s working?
What’s missing?
What would make AppSec feel less like a chore?
Drop a comment below, or DM me if you're open to a short async chat.
Thanks for sharing your experience]]></summary>

Recently, I've been hooked up with automating data ingestion into vector databases, and I came up with ingest-anything, which I talked about in my last post.
Chonkie released CodeChunker, I decided to include code ingestion within ingest-anything, and you can read about it in this LinkedIn post, where I announced the new release:

The only thing left to do then was to build something that could showcase the power of code ingestion within a vector database, and it immediately clicked in my mind: "Why don't I ingest my entire codebase of solved Go exercises from Exercism?"

SAST - (Static Analysis Security Testing)
SAST
Directly analyzes the source code without executing it.
Finds security flaws in logic, APIs, inputs, and error handling, before the app runs.
SAST tool highlights this as a critical flaw immediately and is conducted as White-box testing during the early stages of development.
Tools Used: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode
DAST
Tests the application while running by sending real-world attack patterns.
Finds runtime vulnerabilities like:
Broken authentication.


SQL Injection by actually sending SQL payloads into forms.



DAST sends an input like ' OR '1'='1 into a login form. Vulnerability is reported if the app responds incorrectly (e.g., allows login).
Tools Used: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix]]></summary>

Leveraging the right cloud cost management tools has become essential for finance leaders to optimize cloud spend and ensure efficiency. Traditional resource management strategies often fail to align with the dynamic, usage-based nature of cloud services, requiring a more agile and strategic approach to maintain control over costs.
For years, businesses operated on fixed-resource models, purchasing hardware and infrastructure with predictable, long-term lifespans. The approach was straightforward: once assets were acquired, they were depreciated over time, and financial planning followed a fixed pattern.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States exchange Nasdaq has asked regulators for permission to list a 21Shares exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding the popular memcoin Dogecoin, regulatory filings show. 
The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

“CBDCs were conceived as a technological breakthrough, but so far they look like expensive imitations of existing traditional fiat currencies that citizens and businesses already use through online banking and payment apps,” Goncharova told Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Forum in Moscow.

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.

The move brings 1inch’s Fusion protocol to Solana for the first time. Fusion enables users to define their ideal swap parameters, which are then executed by competing professional market makers, or “resolvers,” using Dutch auction mechanics.

Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.
