        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout my life, I've tried to get on top of my finances and understand my financial performance. I experimented with numerous finance tracker apps, but none of them truly worked for me.
The main issue was their demand for regular input—logging expenses, scanning receipts, categorizing transactions, and tracking goals. This felt like a burden, and I soon realized that I don't need to micromanage my transactions.
It's pointless for me to know if this week's spending is higher than last week's, or if I spent more on clothes this month than usual. What I truly want is a high-level overview of my savings. Did my wealth increase over the year? Is it worthwhile to diversify savings between CNY and USD? What's the total of my savings spread across several banks, brokers, and crypto-wallets?

Whether you’re working on Layer 1 protocols or dApps, understanding what makes a blockchain reliable is essential.
In this post, I want to share key testing insights and red flags to watch out for, as well as highlight three examples of well-architected blockchains I’ve encountered in my QA career.
Testing a blockchain means thinking beyond traditional app behavior. Here’s what separates it:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CSS sign() is not well supported but can be 'polyfilled' with calc & clamp:
  --input: 10; /* <-- Any number */

  --num: calc(var(--input) * infinity); 
  --sign: clamp(-1, var(--num), 1);

Handy if you're attempting conditional logic and you need 0's and 1's instead of numbers. (What? Why? Read more about Binary Linear Interpolation).
How it works:
Multiply by infinity to give us 0 or +/- infinity to avoid rounding errors when dealing with very small decimals. Tip: If you know your input numbers will never be between -1 and 1 then you can skip the calc().
Round to the nearest -1, 0 or 1.

Cybersecurity protects digital systems from attacks, not just hacking, and is crucial for everyone.
It seems likely that common myths, like only techies need it, can leave individuals and businesses vulnerable.
Research suggests small businesses and individuals are often targets, not just big corporations.
The evidence leans toward needing more than strong passwords, like two-factor authentication, for safety.
Recent attacks, such as the 2025 Morocco data breach, show the real-world impact of cybersecurity failures.
Cybersecurity is about keeping your digital life safe, like locking your doors at home. It protects systems, networks, and programs from attacks that can steal data, demand money, or disrupt services. Think of it as …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MatrixSwarm isn’t an orchestrator. It’s not a framework.
No daemons. No containers. Just files.
Every agent lives beside you in the file tree — not underneath you like some fragile Docker brat. They think, spawn, terminate, and resurrect in folders. It’s violent. It’s elegant. It works.
Now imagine this world watching your Apache server. Not with metrics dashboards. Not with Prometheus.
The Problem
You don’t notice until:
3:00 AM
A Discord ping from QA
Or worse — a client calling your phone
The Solution: ApacheSentinel
This thing:
Checks if Apache is alive (systemctl is-active)
Scans for ports 80/443 via ss
Restarts the service if it fails
Dispatches a log-level swarm alert to Discord, Telegram, or Matrix GUI
Rolls daily uptime logs to /comm/apache-sentinel/
If it fails three times in a row?
Because a Watchdog that keeps trying forever is called a failure loop.
🧬 Core Reflex Logic (Excerpt)
def worker(self):
if running and ports_open:
    self.log("[WATCHDOG] ✅ Apache is running.")
else:
    self.log("[WATCHDOG] ❌ Apache is NOT healthy. Restarting.")
    if self.should_alert("apache-down"):
        self.alert_operator("❌ Apache is DOWN or not binding required ports.")
    self.restart_apache()

Apache dies. Reflex triggers.
📜 Deploying the Sentinel
directive = {
python3 site_ops/site_boot.py --universe ops --directive apache_watchdog
🧠 This Isn’t Monitoring — It’s Instinct
Don’t monitor your system.
🎁 Want The Code?
GitHub: https://github.com/matrixswarm/matrixswarm
Docs: https://matrixswarm.com
Discord: https://discord.gg/NEvMJ4DV
Codex: /agents/mirv-hive
⚠️ Final Words
Next time Apache crashes, don’t pray a service notices.
Spawn a sentinel. Let it bite.
Fork the Swarm. Or fork yourself.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me tell you a secret—I used to think CSS colors were boring. "Oh wow, hex codes, how thrilling," I’d say, rolling my eyes so hard I could see my own brain.  
But then I built this Ultimate CSS Colors Tool (Pro Edition™) and—plot twist—it turns out colors are actually kinda dope?  
Why This Tool is Different (And Why You’ll Actually Learn Stuff)


Most color tutorials are like:  
"Here’s HEX, RGB, and HSL."


"Good luck figuring out the rest, loser."



Meanwhile, this tool is like:  
"Here’s HEX, RGB, HSL, HSLA, HWB, OKLab, OKLCH, Display-P3, and even CMYK (for some reason)."


"Oh, you wanna play with sliders and see real-time changes? Say less."


"Want to copy-paste code like a pro? Done."




  
  
  What You Get:


✅ All Color Formats Explained – From basic HEX to futuristic OKLCH.

✅ Interactive Playground – Because reading is hard, but clicking is fun.

✅ Real-World Use Cases – See how colors work in actual CSS (not just theory).

✅ Pre-Made Palettes – Tailwind, Material Design, Flat UI—steal them. I won’t tell.

✅ Copy-Paste Magic – One-click CSS snippets because we’re lazy geniuses.  
The Best Part? It’s Actually Useful


You know those tutorials that teach you something and then you immediately forget it? Yeah, this ain’t that.  
Learn by doing (sliders! buttons! shiny things!)


See contrast ratios (so you don’t blind your users)


Export your colors (because memorizing hex codes is for psychopaths)




  
  
  Try It Yourself (Or Don’t, I’m Not Your Boss)


If you’ve ever:  
Googled "CSS color formats" and got a 10-year-old blog post

Struggled with HSL like it’s some kind of math test

Wanted to use modern color spaces but had no idea how



…then this tool is for you.  
👉 [Check it out here] (or just stare at the pretty colors, I don’t judge).  
Final Thought:


CSS colors don’t have to suck. This tool makes them almost fun. And if it doesn’t? Well, at least you got to play with sliders.  
Happy coloring! 🎨]]></summary>

Okay, so you're trying to speed up your Figma workflow, right? Plugins are the way to go, but not all plugins are created equal. Some can actually slow you down if they're poorly coded or just too resource-intensive. The key is to test and monitor plugin performance regularly.
Here's a simple way to think about it:
Track loading times: How long does it take for the plugin to launch and complete its task?
Monitor Figma's overall performance: Does Figma become laggy or unresponsive after installing the plugin?
Check for conflicts: Does the plugin interfere with other plugins or Figma's core functionality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When deciding between Java and Kotlin for backend development, understanding their key strengths is essential. Java has long been the industry standard for building robust, scalable backend systems with a vast ecosystem and mature frameworks like Spring Boot. It offers excellent performance, strong community support, and extensive libraries, making it a reliable choice for enterprise applications.
On the other hand, Kotlin is rapidly gaining popularity for backend development due to its concise syntax, null safety features, and seamless interoperability with Java. Kotlin’s modern language design reduces boilerplate code, which speeds up development and improves code maintainability. It also supports coroutines, enabling efficient asynchronous programming that’s perfect for building high-performance backend services.
Both languages integrate well with popular tools and cloud platforms, but Kotlin is often preferred in new projects looking for modern solutions, while Java remains dominant in legacy systems and large-scale applications. Ultimately, your choice should consider factors like project requirements, team expertise, and future scalability. Staying updated with current trends, frameworks, and cloud-native development can help you make the best decision for backend programming in 2024.]]></summary>

Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.
“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.”

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks

Other financial institutions linked to the potential stablecoin include Early Warning Services, the parent company of digital payments network Zelle, and the payment network Clearing House.
The discussions are still in the early stages, and a final decision on the project could change depending on the regulatory environment and the demand for stablecoins.

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.
“Now, within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” it added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry.
According to a May 22 Axios report, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley will file an amendment to the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, to block a US president from profiting from stablecoins. The proposed amendment would come after 18 Democrats sided with Republicans in the Senate in voting to advance the bill on May 20 after it failed a procedural vote on May 8.

The SEC’s decision on a spot XRP ETF could ignite a significant rally.

The current $2.2 billion in XRP futures hints at growing institutional investor demand.

The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP (XRP) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States' “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a years-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8.

Ive joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.
