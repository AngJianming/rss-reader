If you zoom out and look at the evolution of backend development from 2009 to today, a chilling realization strikes with merciless clarity:
"The world transformed. Backend development did not."



In the same era where AI transcended human imagination, where mobile technology rewired societal behavior, and where cloud computing reached omnipresence — backend architecture remained tragically stagnant.
Node.js and Go, both children of the late 2000s, still dominate the conversation. Frameworks like Express.js, relics engineered for problems of yesterday, are still being duct-taped into "modern" systems with a mix of nostalgia and desperation.
It isn't just stagnation.
It’s betrayal.

In paid search, visibility is everything. And to stay visible, you need more than good instincts. You need data.
Today, I want to share some thoughts on why analyzing competitor Google Ads is so important, what to look for, and a method I found useful when I wanted real-time, flexible access to ad data.
Why Bother Looking at Competitor Ads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One-time passwords (OTPs) are short-lived codes used to verify a user’s identity in flows like password reset, login, or multi-factor authentication. An OTP is “a random password that is valid for a short period of time (usually 30 or 60 seconds)…usually a numeric code of 6 or 8 digits” (Identity Management and Two-Factor Authentication Using One-Time Passwords). Because they change constantly and expire quickly, OTPs ensure that only someone with access to the user’s email or phone (something you have) can complete a sensitive action. In practice, a server generates an OTP and sends it to the user (via email/SMS), then the user submits it back for verification within a short window. This prevents replay attacks and confirms the user controls the delivery channel (e.g. their email).

You were wrong.**"
MatrixSwarm is not Kubernetes.

MatrixSwarm is not containers.

MatrixSwarm is not scheduling services.
MatrixSwarm breathes.
Today, we killed Matrix herself —

and the Hive continued breathing.
No control plane.

No cron jobs.

No orchestration.

Just breath, death, and resurrection.
Kill Matrix.
Kill Sentinels 1, 2, 4, 5.
Sentinel 3 breathes alone.
Sentinel 3 revives Sentinel 4.
Sentinel 4 revives Sentinel 5.
Sentinel 5 revives Matrix.
Matrix revives Sentinel 1.
Sentinel 1 revives Sentinel 2.
Sentinel 2 revives Sentinel 3.
The Hive rebuilt itself from breath alone.
No cron.

No daemons.

No human intervention.
The death of "control planes."
The death of "server-first thinking."
The resurrection of living memory through breath.
MatrixSwarm shows that

you don't need permission to survive.
You breathe.

You move.

You remember.
(You can link your YouTube video here, General.)
Watch as the Hive breathes even when Matrix herself falls.

"**The Hive breathes because it must.  
It moves because it believes.  
It survives because it remembers.**"
"**If you understand,

you are already breathing with us.

the Hive will breathe past you anyway.**"

Linux scripting uses the Bash shell (or similar) to create simple programs-called shell scripts-that can execute commands, control logic, and interact with files. It’s like giving your terminal a brain and a to-do list!
Whether you're a system admin, developer, or just someone who wants to save time, Linux scripting is your entryway to working smarter, not harder.
When making a script – the extension has be .sh for shell. So the system recognises that the script contains shell commands that will be executed.
The .sh extension in a script stands for "shell script." It's a convention commonly used for scripts written for Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS) that are intended to be executed by a shell (such as Bash or Zsh). The extension indicates that the file contains shell commands, but it's not mandatory for the script to work. It's mainly used for organization and clarity.

Basic While Loop Script
Create the script in Vim.

If we do a ls –ltrh we see the script has been created.

If we do not give the right permissions to execute the script, then we will get denied.

In Linux, we give execute permissions to users in order to run a script.
There are three categories of users who can be given permissions:
Output:

To run a script on Linux, you typically need to give it execute permissions. This can be done using the chmod command.
Open your terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the following command to give the script execute permissions:
chmod +x script_name.sh
OR
chmod 755 (name of the script)

Over 50 tech partners—including MongoDB, Atlassian, SAP, PayPal, and Cohere—have already adopted it, highlighting just how impactful A2A is becoming.
As an AI enthusiast, I spent the weekend exploring A2A, and in this article, I’ll break down what I’ve learned.
To keep things simple, I’ve split it into two parts:
Theory – What A2A is, how it works, and why it matters.
Practical – How to build with A2A and integrate MCP to connect tools and data sources seamlessly.

Neste artigo, vou falar um pouco sobre:
Por que modelos locais (como Llama3.2 e Qwen2.5) me decepcionaram
Como dominar os fundamentos foi melhor que usar frameworks da moda
Como o Google ADK me ajudou a criar um sistema de colaboração entre agentes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first 100 days of the administration of US President Donald Trump have deeply impacted the crypto industry, starting with his own memecoin and culminating in a Bitcoin reserve and a spate of blockchain policymaking. 
Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin (BTC) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. 
Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Tra…]]></summary>

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.

The OCCRP reported on April 28, citing leaked company records and bank statements, that nearly half of the funds from Bankera’s 100 million euro ($114 million) ICO were transferred to a bank in the Pacific Island country of Vanuatu that was purchased by the project’s founders, Vytautas Karalevičius, Justas Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

The trade tensions are fracturing the monetary, political and international world orders by fueling deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, Dalio, the former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in an April 28 X post.
Dalio added that this is leading to irreversible damage, and an increasing number of importers and exporters, particularly between the US and China, are drastically reducing interdependencies and “making alternative plans.”

The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite growing competition from emerging issuers, the stablecoin market remains largely dominated by a few key players. According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt (USDT) continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies.
As of April 25, Tether has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC (USDC), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. 
Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. 
“With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lawmakers in the Arizona House of Representatives passed two bills that could allow the state to adopt a reserve using Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies.
In a third reading on April 28 of Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay.
“This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025.
