        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21, a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed via a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s desk for either a signature or a veto.
SB 21, authored by state Senator Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirements is Bitcoin.
Rep. Capriglione presenting SB 21. Source: Bitcoin Laws
Before the vote, state representative Capriglione said to the chamber that the bill was a “pivotal moment in securing Texas’s leadership in the digital age with the passage of our strategic Bitcoin reserve. Now, we embrace a modern asset with traditional properties for future promise.”
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.]]></summary>

Physically, I’ve got just enough energy to handle work. Right now, I’m trying to get back to my previous level of stamina and focus through diet and exercise, but it’s taking more time than I expected.
But this is my dream, and I don’t want to walk away from it so easily. At the very least, over the past year, I’ve managed to get a lot of things in order, changed the way I work, and cut down on distractions as much as possible.

Visualizing data is crucial for understanding trends and distributions in web applications. Recharts, a popular React charting library, makes it easy to create interactive and responsive charts by combining the power of D3 with the flexibility of React components. It offers a sweet spot between customization and ease of use, whether you're building analytics dashboards or simple data displays while keeping bundle size in check.
In this article, we'll explore:
Building a Line Chart (for time-based trends)


Building a Pie Chart (for percentage distributions)


Handling Edge Cases in a Pie Chart (e.g when one category is 100%)

As a beginner you are likely working alone, however this is by no means any excuse to avoid version control. Its benefits are numerous including reverting to more stable builds for play testing or collaborating on specific features apart from the entire codebase. 
On my first attempt at my Fishing simulator game I made the mistake of setting up a repo after the fact, causing a migraine and a half of refactoring folder structures. It’s best to set up your repository first so future updates are seamlessly committed.

Knowing CORS inside out doesn’t just make you feel smarter—it’s critical for building secure systems on the internet.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is like a big bouncer at the gate of your browser’s exclusive club, saying:
“SORRY, YOU’RE NOT ON THE LIST.”
...to any uninvited requests.

There are many ways to learn about CORS. In this blog, we’re ditching the frontend perspective (and the cybersecurity deep dive) to focus on:
What CORS actually does
Why it exists
How you—the backend dev—are in charge of making it behave

If you're learning C#, you've likely tripped over some subtle but common traps around data types. Here are five tricky data type behaviors every beginner (and even experienced devs!) should know.
Let's clarify with an example that directly highlights the confusion beginners face:
// Using arrays (clearly reference types)
int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] arr2 = arr1;
arr2[0] = 99;
Console.WriteLine(arr1[0]); // What's the output?

Did you say 99? You're correct!
Now, compare this with integers:
// Using integers (value types)
int num1 = 10;
int num2 = num1;
num2 = 20;
Console.WriteLine(num1); // What's the output?

This prints 10.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever faced difficulty with conversions from JSON to CSV or CSV to JSON?
JSON makes a programmer’s life easy, while CSV makes an accountant’s life easy. But when we’re working across teams or systems, we often need both formats.
That’s where conversions come in.
Sure, there are plenty of online tools available. It’s convenient — but let’s pause for a second...
What about data privacy?
We’re developers — we can solve this ourselves.
And the best part?
Bash script + PHP (hey, PHP isn’t dead yet 😉).
JSON to CSV
php -r '$data = json_decode(file_get_contents("path/input.json"), true);$fp = fopen("output.csv", "w");fputcsv($fp, array_keys($data[0]));foreach ($data as $row) fputcsv($fp, $row);fclose($fp);'

CSV to JSON
php -r '$csv = array_map("str_getcsv", file("path/input.csv"));$headers = array_shift($csv);$data = array_map(fn($row) => array_combine($headers, $row), $csv);file_put_contents("path/output.json", json_encode($data, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT));'

➕Bonus: XLSX to JSON
libreoffice --headless --convert-to csv input.xlsx --outdir . && mv input.csv desired_name.csv

Then reuse the CSV to JSON step above.]]></summary>

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[America’s powerful banking lobby is “panicking” over the potential of stablecoins to disrupt their traditional business model, particularly when it comes to yield-bearing stablecoins, according to Austin Campbell, a New York University professor and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting. 
In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transit…]]></summary>

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” 
The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

One of the biggest winners is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amsterdam-based Theta Capital Management raised over $175 million for its latest fund-of-funds, aimed at supporting early-stage blockchain startups through specialized venture capital (VC) firms.
The new vehicle, Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will channel capital into crypto-native VC firms with a track record of backing blockchain innovation, Theta’s managing partner and chief investment officer Ruud Smets told Bloomberg.
Smets said the strategy focuses on specialist managers who can outperform generalist investors in the earliest funding rounds.
“We’ve always been looking for areas where specialization and active management provide a sustainable edge,” Smets noted. He said that the experience and positioning of dedicated crypto VCs “has compounded over time,” creating barriers for less f…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund and on Grayscale’s XRP ETF bid, which analysts had expected.
The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that both delays were expected because the SEC “typically…]]></summary>

However, Blackstone’s investment, reported in a May 20 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only totaled around $1.08 million — a fraction of the asset manager’s $1.2 trillion portfolio.
Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) as of March 31.
The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, Google Finance data shows.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam.
“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”

“We have experts right here, and they are going to help us navigate solutions that serve our city,” he added. “The age of tokenization, which includes crypto and blockchain and other fintech innovations, that age is here, and we’re going to continue to move forward with it.”
Adams didn’t share further details on the advisory group, but said a council chair and key policy recommendations would follow in the next few weeks.

The SEC said on May 20 that it charged Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini and former investment chief Alex Dominguez with misleading over 5,000 investors about certificates that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock.

The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities — which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year.
