        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On May 9–10, WhiteBIT hosted the first-ever International Crypto Trading Cup (ICTC 2025)—a live-streamed global event positioning crypto trading within a competitive, real-time framework reminiscent of esports.
From a technical and developmental perspective, ICTC marked a shift: crypto trading is evolving into a spectator-based model, requiring low-latency infrastructure, robust user interfaces, and fail-safe execution environments to handle high-volume, high-stakes operations live.
ICTC 2025 hosted:
8 elite crypto traders on stage in real-time competition
12 total hours of live trading, with 269 trades executed
33 squad-based teams and ~3,000 participants worldwide


Top squad sizes: 369 and 298 members
The infrastructure had to support both professional-grade trading and a public-facing,…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🗥️ So I was casually doomscrolling X (yes, again)... when I stumbled upon a post by DEV Community that made my brain short-circuit:
✨ “ScoutDB turns plain English into MongoDB queries.”
Wait, what?!
You've got the data questions, but not always the query-fu:
"Find all users who joined after Jan 2023 and liked more than 5 posts"

Normally, you'd need to hand-craft some MongoDB incantation like:
db.users.aggregate([
  { $match: { joinDate: { $gte: ISODate("2023-01-01") }, likes: { $gt: 5 } } }
])

But what if you could skip the syntax pain?
ScoutDB is like having a friendly AI that:
✅ Understands what you're trying to ask in English
explore like a boss
You type:
Show me all posts with more than 100 likes created in the last 30 days

ScoutDB replies with:
db.posts.find({
  likes: { $gt: 100 },
  createdAt: { $gte: new Date(Date.now() - 30*24*60*60*1000) }
})

Then maps the results and relationships for you in a visual explorer.
No more $lookup headaches. No more crying in JSON.
Saw this post by @ThePracticalDev on X 👇
(I swear MongoDB and ScoutDB logos look like they just agreed to rescue all devs from query hell)

🗣️ English → MongoDB query? ✅
🧠 Auto-maps your schema? ✅
🎨 Visual canvas for data exploration? ✅
🧣 Found it while doomscrolling Twitter? BIG ✅
🧵 Original Post from DEV Community






💬 So, are you still writing $match manually or are you letting ScoutDB take the wheel?

Its friendly compiler not only infers types automatically but also provides helpful error messages that guide you toward writing sound code. In this post, we'll explore practical examples that highlight how Elm’s type inference and compiler feedback enhance code correctness and simplify your development experience.
When coding in Elm, the compiler deduces the types of values based on their usage. This lets you focus on application logic rather than on managing repetitive type declarations.
Consider a simple arithmetic function:
square x =
    x * x

Since the multiplication operator (*) applies only to numbers, Elm infers that x must be a number. No extra annotations are needed, keeping y…]]></summary>

However, what if they made a typo when providing the email address? Or they simply want to create an account without any real interest in using the service as intended? In either case you’ll want to verify that they can access the email address they’ve given you.
The simplest approach adopted by most is to send a unique link in an email to that address, and have a user click on that link to verify their account. It’s simple, but it works.

In a May 15 report, AMLBot’s onchain investigation team explained that Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report stated.

My name is Alireza Minagar, and I come from a rather unique background — as a neurologist, researcher, and now a software engineering student.
After years of diagnosing complex neurological conditions, I’ve begun exploring how artificial intelligence and software can revolutionize healthcare. Surprisingly, many skills from my medical background translate directly into programming.
Here are 5 lessons from neurology that shape how I now think about software engineering:
In medicine, we never treat a symptom without understanding its root cause. Debugging works the same way — don’t guess. Investigate.
Analyzing EEGs or MRIs is about spotting patterns. Writing efficient code or identifying logical bugs requires the same cognitive muscle.
Whether prescribing medication or defining logic in code, tiny errors can lead to serious consequences. Precision builds trust — in both healthcare and software.
Medical professionals live by notes. In code, comments, READMEs, and clear commit messages keep everything healthy and maintainable.
In both medicine and tech, decisions have real consequences. Transparent, explainable algorithms are just as vital as informed consent.
I’m currently learning Python, full-stack engineering, and bioinformatics with the goal of contributing to healthcare-focused AI solutions.
Let’s build a world where medical insight and machine logic support — not replace — human care.

As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s.

Chanos argued that Strategy is selling the idea of buying Bitcoin (BTC) in a corporate structure, and that other companies are following suit in hopes of receiving a similar market premium.

The newly launched USP synthetic dollar is fully backed by real-world private credit, Pareto told Cointelegraph on May 15. To mint USP, users must deposit stablecoins such as USDC (USDC) and USDt (USDT), which are then held as collateral.
“USP is backed 1:1 by the stablecoins used during the minting process,” Pareto co-founder Matteo Pandolfi told Cointelegraph in a written statement.
The deposited funds are placed into Pareto’s credit vaults and lent to what the company describes as “vetted institutional borrowers,” generating yields for participants.

Lawmakers are reportedly working on a Bitcoin (BTC) national reserve proposal, with a draft bill in its final stages, according to Yaroslav Zhelezniak, a member of parliament who confirmed the plan to local media outlet Incrypted.
The proposal was announced during the CRYPTO 2025 conference in Kyiv on Feb. 6. “We will soon submit a draft law from the industry allowing the creation of crypto reserves,” Zhelezniak said.
Cointelegraph reached out to Zhelezniak for comment on the bill’s status but had not received a response by publication.

Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.
This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.

A discussion on digital property rights, copyright, intellectual property, the open metaverse, AI and value without physical form.
When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.
Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions.

“For whatever reason, there is a perception that’s out there that crypto is an asset that is untraceable, and that really lends itself to criminals acting in a certain way,” he said.
