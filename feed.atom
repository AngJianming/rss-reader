AWS-Q-Chat is an advanced, developer-friendly code execution sandbox that lets you run Python code in fully isolated Docker containers, simulating real-world network and resource chaos with surgical precision.
What makes it novel?
Programmable Chaos: Users can inject network latency, bandwidth throttling, timeouts, CPU/memory stress, artificial delays, and even forced crashes-on demand, per job.
API-Driven and Concurrent: The REST API supports multiple, concurrent, isolated jobs, each with its own scenario.
Resilience Education: This is more than a code runner-it’s a resilience lab, showing how code responds to edge cases and failures you can’t easily reproduce elsewhere.

My inspiration for this project is threefold: the classic PC game, Pong, Pickleball and the 80s sci-fi movie TRON. I wanted to combine the two games into one – using pickleball paddles and a pickleball ball as the main interactive elements and the gameplay of Pong. Finally, TRON is my inspiration for the UI.
I favor Visual Studio Code in my workflow, so I used Amazon Q Developer within Visual Studio Code as a chat buddy. I am letting Amazon Q Developer handle all the coding while I stepped into the director role, sipped my coffee and instructed the AI developer along the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Go, when you have multiple struct types that need to perform the same methods, it can often lead to code duplication. This issue is quite common, especially in cases where you have several struct types with similar methods. In this article, we will explore how to effectively reduce method duplication using interfaces and composition, thereby making your code cleaner and more maintainable.
Understanding the Problem
Let's begin by analyzing the problem you've presented. You have several structs (A, B, C, and D) that all implement the same methods, specifically Add and Remove. Repetition of code leads to maintenance challenges—any change in method logic must be mirrored across all structs, increasing the risk of errors.
The Traditional Approach

Agentic AI Driven Legacy Code Modernization using Amazon Q addresses the challenge of transforming legacy systems into modern, maintainable code while preserving business logic and functional accuracy. Legacy systems, often written in outdated languages, hinder scalability, security, and integration with modern architectures.
Solution Approach:
Input Processing: Users upload legacy code files through a Streamlit interface.


Agent Selection: The system dynamically selects the appropriate AI agent based on the input language (e.g., COBOL, Fortran).


Conversion Execution: Using Amazon Q Developer, the CrewAI agents convert the input code to the selected modern language (e.g., Python).

Deploying applications on AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies many aspects of running your web applications, but setting up SSL/TLS on single-instance environments can get a bit tricky. In this article, we’ll explore two practical approaches to implementing SSL for your Elastic Beanstalk single instances.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk single instances don’t come with built-in SSL termination like their load-balanced counterparts. When you deploy a web application in a single-instance environment, you’re essentially working with a standalone EC2 instance without the benefits of an Application Load Balancer to handle SSL termination.
However, there are compelling reasons to use single instances:

In August 2024, IEX Cloud – a platform that once promised to democratize financial data – was officially shut down. For developers, fintech startups, and anyone seeking accessible market data, this closure marked the end of an era. IEX Cloud had been a breath of fresh air in a space long dominated by expensive, enterprise-focused data providers.

Before diving into the implementation, let's quickly recap what A2A is all about:
A2A is an open protocol that standardizes how agents in a multi-agent framework discover each other, communicate, and collaborate to perform tasks autonomously without human intervention.
In this blog, we’ll walk through the implementation of the A2A protocol to understand how agent discovery and communication work in practice.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…]]></summary>

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…]]></summary>

Robert Kiyosaki says ditch ‘fake money’ for Bitcoin, gold, and silver
Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.

However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.
“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”
The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Law enforcement detained the wrong person for a 2022 scam that pilfered more than $1 million worth of Bored Ape non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cybersecurity researcher ZachXBT said. 
In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports.

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.
