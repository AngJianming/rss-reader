Smart contracts on Ethereum can receive ETH directly. But what actually happens when someone sends ETH to a contract? And why do some transactions fail silently while others go through?
Let’s dive deep into how Ether is handled in Solidity, the differences between receive() and fallback(), and some key developer mistakes you should avoid.
When you send ETH to a contract, one of two functions will be triggered based on the context:
receive() external payable
fallback() external payable
These are special functions in Solidity that aren’t called directly in code. They get triggered under very specific circumstances.
receive() Run?


The receive() function runs when:

However, while the ocean of theory is vast, it's the crashing waves of practice that truly test the truth.

Although the idea of a Drupal template marketplace seems like a good idea to me and could be a good boost for Drupal as a product and therefore for the Drupal community, these are my doubts, fears, or a mix of everything.
When we talk about a Drupal template marketplace, the WordPress marketplace comes to mind. It's true that this marketplace works and has possibly been one of WordPress's successes in becoming the product it is today, as it allowed someone without technical knowledge to have a beautiful and operational website.

This document presents a thorough reflection on how to establish a readable, rigorous, and coherent coding syntax for the use of parentheses and braces in PHP. Rather than perpetuating historical conventions inherited from languages like C or Java, it is based on a clear principle: code should reflect the logic of the language, not formatting habits.
The goal of this proposal is to define a style that is:
Unified: one rule applies uniformly across all relevant constructs—functions, control structures, or inner expressions;
Systematic: each rule follows directly from syntactic structure, not from lexical category (keyword, identifier, etc.);
Consistent: treatment is aligned across similar cases, with no arbitrary exceptions;
Easy to remember: by eliminating contextual variations…]]></summary>

Without a cohesive strategy, organizations face increased risk, inconsistent access controls, and compliance blind spots.
In this article, we break down the top IAM challenges enterprises face in multi-cloud setups and how to address them with scalable, secure solutions.
Each cloud provider has its own IAM structure. AWS uses IAM roles and policies, Azure relies on role-based access control (RBAC), and GCP leverages Identity-Aware Proxy and IAM roles.

One day, while working in my old industry, I found myself asking:  
Why am I doing this? What’s the point?
That question led to action.

I quit.

I joined a coding bootcamp.

I studied full-time for 4 months.

I landed my first role at an international blockchain company.

Then I left again—this time, for Tokyo.
After a year learning Japanese, I restarted my career here as a full-time software engineer at a startup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a submission for the Runner H "AI Agent Prompting" Challenge
I built a Job Search AI Agent that analyzes your resume and searches for job listings that best match your profile. Instead of manually filtering job boards, the AI reads your resume, understands your experience, and intelligently finds job opportunities aligned with your skills, role, and interests.
It’s like having a personal AI recruiter that works on your behalf — 24/7.
Here’s how it works:
Upload your resume (PDF or text)
The AI parses your experience, skills, and role
It then runs targeted searches across job boards
Finally, it summarizes and suggests job listings that match your profile





  
  
  How I Used Runner H


Runner H’s AI agent framework made it easier to structure tasks like:
Resume parsing (using NLP)
Role-based matching
Job board search automation
Prompt chaining to create a decision-making loop (e.g., reject mismatches, refine search)
I built prompts that:
Understand the candidate’s background
Convert it into a structured "search query"
Evaluate results based on match score and keywords
Summarize the top roles with direct links
It felt like using a smart co-pilot for job hunting.
📌 Use Case:
Instead of you finding jobs, jobs find you — based on what you’re best at.
🌍 Impact:
Saves time and mental effort
Increases relevance of job matches
Helps junior and mid-level devs who are unsure how to “market” their resume
This can easily be extended for recruiters, freelance platforms, or even career counselors.
This challenge pushed me to build something not only technical, but practically useful in everyday life.
🙏 Shout-out to Runner H and Dev.to for encouraging creative use of AI agents.
🤖 AI doesn’t just generate — it can collaborate, assist, and elevate your job search game.]]></summary>
