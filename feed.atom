        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using the fetch method, you can send files from the frontend to your Node.js backend for processing. Here's a simple example:
1. Backend (Node.js with Express & Multer)
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: './uploads/',
    filename: (req, file, cb) => {
        cb(null, file.originalname);
    }
});

const upload = multer({ storage: storage });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'File uploaded successfully', filename: req.file.filename });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));

2. Frontend (Using fetch to Upload File)
<input type="file" id="fileInput">
<button onclick="uploadFile()">Upload</button>

<script>
function uploadFile() {
    const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
    const file = fileInput.files[0];

    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    fetch('http://localhost:3000/upload', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
}
</script>


3. Running the Project
Open the HTML file in your browser, select a file, and click "Upload."
This will send the file to the backend using the fetch method and store it in the uploads directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s Key Decision: Reworking the LP Structure
I originally had a rough LP structure mapped out by Day 2, but after sitting with it, I realized it wasn’t strong enough.
So today, I took a step back to revisit:
Step 1: Project Purpose
Step 4: LP Wireframe (HTML Mockup)
This meant rewriting my objectives and redefining how each section connects to user intent. It was a difficult but necessary reset.
The new flow feels much more aligned with the story I want the page to tell.
Step 4.5: Information architecture & content prioritization  
This step ended up being naturally integrated into Step 4 during the restructuring. With that handled, I moved on to Step 5.
Step 5: Copywriting
I wrote all core copy for the new layout. Headlines, subheads, and body content.
To make the tone feel more rooted in the region, I experimented with adding local dialect terms from the farming area. It’s subtle, but I think it adds a sense of personality and authenticity.
Compared to my initial draft, this version feels more alive, more honest, more me. That’s always a good sign.
Reflections
Rewriting structure mid-way costs time and I was lucky this was a personal project.
If this were a real client project with a tight deadline, the reset would’ve been dangerous.
I’m reminded how critical it is to lock purpose and user goals before building layout.
Also the more I write and build for this farm, the more affection I feel for them.



That’s the magic of creative work. It turns research into care.
Next Step
Step 6: Design (desktop/mobile)
Let’s keep building!

Stop guessing which loop to use. Here's the simple decision framework.
Ever stared at your code wondering: "Should I use a for loop or while loop here?"
You're not alone. This confusion trips up beginners constantly, and I see experienced developers make the wrong choice too.
Here's the truth: picking the right loop isn't about syntax, it's about intent.
Let me show you exactly when to use each one, with real examples you'll actually encounter.
Use for loops when: You know exactly how many times to repeat

Use while loops when: You repeat until some condition changes
That's it. Everything else flows from this.
Perfect for countable operations:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're building AI systems, data pipelines, or backend services in Python, you’ve probably run into weird bugs with mypy not picking up types or imports mysteriously failing—especially when you’re working across microservices or large codebases.
Chances are… you’re using a namespace package (maybe without even knowing it). Let’s break it down.
📦 Regular Packages vs Namespace Packages
init.py file
project/
init.py
Namespace Packages
init.py needed
src/coretools/featurestore/
With namespace packages, coretools.featurestore.encoder and libs.featurestore.scaler can coexist under the same import path.
Or in mypy.ini:
Use p your.package.name instead of just the folder
Set MYPYPATH + -explicit-package-bases if your source layout is non-standard
Still struggling? Add dummy init.pyi or init.py
This helps tools infer structure even in namespace packages.
🧾 Summary Table
“Namespaces are one honking great idea — let's do more of those.”
🔍 TakeAway
If you're building modular AI pipelines, ML services, or shared tooling across teams—you need to understand how namespace packages and tools like mypy interact. It's the difference between silent bugs and confident code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About Author
On June 10, 2025, the Apache team released a security advisory for a critical vulnerability in Kafka Connect: CVE-2025-27817. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely read arbitrary files from the server—no user interaction required.
If you’re using Apache Kafka Connect or systems that integrate it (like Apache Druid), you need to patch ASAP.
Kafka Connect’s vulnerability comes from insecure handling of two configuration parameters:
sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url
sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url
These were not properly sanitized. By crafting malicious URLs, attackers can trigger arbitrary file reads or even perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
Arbitrary File Read: Attackers can access sensitive files on the server, including credentials and config files.
No authentication required
Works under default configuration
High risk, easy to exploit
Impacts remote systems over the network
Apache Kafka: 3.1.0 – 3.9.0

Don’t expose Kafka Connect directly to the internet.
In standalone mode, check and restrict the following:



connect-standalone.properties: listeners, rest.host.name






In distributed mode:



connect-distributed.properties: listeners, rest.host.name






Use a Web Application Firewall (like SafeLine) or firewall rules to block suspicious requests to /connectors with file paths.
Apache has released version 3.9.1, which addresses this issue. Upgrade now:
Download Kafka 3.9.1

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s explore the evolving DNA of modern software testing and how it’s driving smarter software delivery.
Gone are the days of “test-after-build.”
✅ Proactive testing reduces downstream costs and accelerates delivery.
Automation is no longer a nice-to-have — it’s essential. But not everything should be automated.
Effective teams:
Automate repetitive, high-volume tests (like regression and smoke)
Keep humans in the loop for exploratory, usability, and creative testing
Continuously monitor flaky test suites
🧠 It's not about how much you automate, but how smartly you do it.
Modern systems are complex. APIs, microservices, third-party integrations — they all need testing.
QA engineers today:
Validate APIs and contracts
Simulate data in isolated environments
Test for scalability, load, and failure conditions
🚀 Testing behind the UI = better coverage and faster feedback loops.
Measuring success by “number of test cases” is outdated. Now, teams focus on:
Defect leakage rate
Time to detect & time to fix
Test coverage for critical business flows
Flakiness & stability of automation suites
📊 Real metrics drive real quality.
Testers are no longer the gatekeepers — they’re collaborators.
👏 The best testers today act as user champions, not just bug hunters.
Software testing in 2025 is strategic, continuous, and collaborative.
Let’s stop treating QA as a checkbox and start recognizing it as the core of software excellence.
