Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt cri…]]></summary>

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a crucial aspect of modern JavaScript engines, significantly affecting performance, behavior, and execution efficiency. This article delves deep into JIT compilation, exploring its historical evolution, inner workings, practical implications on JavaScript code, performance considerations, debuggability, and real-world applications, aiming to provide senior developers with an exhaustive reference on the topic.
JavaScript's origins trace back to Brendan Eich's creation in 1995, which initially lacked the sophistication of today’s development environments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a submission for the Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators.
Postmark Kanban Inbox is a simple ticket management system that turns incoming emails into categorized, actionable Kanban cards - powered by Postmark's inbound webhooks with facebook/bart-large-mnli, a powerful language model that can categorize messages without any fine-tuning.
You can run the full app locally by following the steps in the README.
The README includes everything you need to:
Start both the frontend and backend servers
Set up a Postmark inbound webhook (with ngrok)
Send test emails or use curl/JSON for local testing

You can explore the full project source code here:
🔗 https://github.com/iefendiev/postmark-kanban-inbox
The repository contains:
A server/ folder with the Express + Prisma backend
A client/ folder with the React + Tailwind frontend
A comprehensive README with setup instructions and usage notes
This project was built with a clean separation between backend and frontend, allowing full control over both Postmark webhook handling and UI rendering.
Node.js + Express for setting up the webhook and exposing RESTful endpoints
Prisma + SQLite for a fast, file-based data layer — ideal for local testing
Postmark Inbound Webhook to receive and parse raw email data
Hugging Face Inference API using the facebook/bart-large-mnli model for zero-shot classification of ticket category and priority
Vite + React + TypeScript for a fast, modern development environment
Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI for a polished and consistent interface
TanStack Query to manage API data and caching
@dnd-kit for Kanban-style drag-and-drop ticket management
Confetti animation triggers when a ticket is marked as resolved 🎉
I usually stick to frontend work, but this challenge pushed me to try new things, and I’m really glad it did.]]></summary>

Have you ever wondered where all those images, videos, documents, and backups are stored when you use cloud-based applications? Chances are, a lot of it lives in AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service).
S3 is arguably one of the most widely used and foundational services in AWS, but its "simplicity" can sometimes hide its immense power. Let's demystify it with a familiar analogy: A Self-Storage Unit Facility.
Imagine you have too many things at home (digital data!) and you need a reliable, secure place to store them, perhaps for a long time, or just for a short period. You go to a massive self-storage facility.

Ever wondered how websites and applications actually run in the cloud? One of the foundational services in AWS is EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), and it's much simpler to grasp than you might think – especially if you imagine it as a bustling restaurant.
Imagine you want to open a restaurant. What do you need?
A Kitchen (The Server): This is where all the cooking happens. In the AWS world, an EC2 instance is your virtual "kitchen" – a server that provides the computing power (CPU), memory (RAM), storage, and networking capabilities needed to run your application or website.

I'm excited to share a new initiative I'm building: GovAfrika Journal — a digital journal focused on African politics, democracy, governance, and cultural expression.
The vision behind GovAfrika is to create a platform where African scholars, activists, students, and writers can share insights, research, and stories that contribute to understanding and shaping democratic culture on the continent.
Currently, the project is hosted on Blogger as we explore options for expansion and development. We plan to eventually build:
A full-featured journal website
Submission and peer-review systems
Articles, opinion pieces, and academic essays
Multilingual support (especially African languages)
We welcome developers, writers, designers, and open-source collaborators who are passionate about:
Civic tech in Africa
Open knowledge
Academic publishing
Cultural heritage and democracy
You can visit the early version here: govafrika.blogspot.com
Feel free to connect, give feedback, or join the journey!

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

"I only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose," Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.

If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company's seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's tran…]]></summary>

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.
HYPE chart fractal targets 240% rally by July
In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…]]></summary>

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …]]></summary>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain privacy tools such as zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs will become increasingly necessary to protect online user data in the age of artificial intelligence, according to Eran Barak, CEO of Shielded Technologies, the developer behind the Midnight privacy chain.
In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Barak said corporate service providers and centralized servers are expected to become honeypots for AI-assisted hackers and malicious actors looking to steal valuable data, including private keys, financial metadata, medical records, and government documents.
Hackers targeting centralized entities have a "massive" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signaled support for a bill recently passed by the state House of Representatives that would establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve.
In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.
