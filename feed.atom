Microsoft's bold integration of artificial intelligence within Microsoft 365 challenges—and changes—this paradigm entirely. As AI quietly assumes the ordinary, IT admins can step forward into the extraordinary, shifting from managing minutiae to shaping strategy.
What happens to an IT admin freed from repetitive chores? They're empowered to innovate, wield influence, and transform their role from problem-solvers into organisational visionaries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I found out that disabling a form field in Rails means it won't be submitted at all. I used disabled: true thinking I could show a value that users can’t change — and I could — but the downside is that the value doesn’t get sent to the controller.
I learned that if I want the value to be shown but not editable and still be passed in the form data, the correct attribute to use is readonly: true.
This small difference between disabled and readonly matters when you're depending on that data in your controller.
It’s not a Rails issue; it’s how forms work in general.
<%= form_with model: @user do |form| %>
  <!-- This won't send the value -->
  <%= form.text_field :email, disabled: true %>

  <!-- This will send the value -->
  <%= form.text_field :email, readonly: true %>
<% end %>

This was a helpful thing to learn today. Hopefully it saves someone else a bit of time too.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In very simple terms, Machine Learning is the process of using existing data to create a mathematical function.
For example, we have an ice cream shop's data that includes the average temperature of the past 30 days, along with the number of ice creams sold on each day. We can analyze this data (average temperature and number of ice creams sold) and can create a mathematical function that fits with the existing data.
Further, this function can take the average temperature as input and return the prediction of the number of ice creams that can be sold on that day.
From the existing data, the data that we use as the condition, in our case, the average temperature, is called a Feature. The main data that we are targeting to predict, in our case, the number of ice creams sold, is called the Label (also known as the target variable in technical terms).
In mathematical terms, the features are referred using 


  xxx

. Hence, the features can be represented as [

  x1,x2,x3,...,xnx_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_nx1​,x2​,x3​,...,xn​

]; whereas the label is referred to as 

  yyy

.
The process of defining the function using the existing data is called Training. This is the step where the model (a general term used for the mathematical function we create) learns the relationship between features and labels.
Further, the process of using the defined function to get the predicted value is called Inferencing.
In mathematical terms, the function is referred to as 

  f(x)f(x)f(x)

. Moreover, the predicted value by the function is referred to as 

  y^=f(x)\hat{y} = f(x)y^​=f(x)

Want to dive deeper? Let’s explore each one step by step! 🚀
What it does: Teaches AI to pick actions that earn the most "points" (like a game).
How it works:
It learns by trial and error, updating the cheat sheet over time.
What it does: Upgrades Q-Learning for complex tasks (like playing video games).
How it works:
Remembers past experiences to learn faster.
3️⃣ A (A-Star): The GPS for AI*


What it does: **Finds the shortest path from A to B (used in games/maps).

Combines actual distance + smart guesses to avoid useless paths.
What it does: Teaches AI directly what to do (instead of just tracking rewards).
How it works:
Adjusts probabilities—like tuning a dial to prefer actions that work best.
What it does: Helps AI plan ahead by simulating future moves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of blockchain technology company Solana Labs, has revealed the next steps for its soon-to-be-shipped Seeker device and the overall ecosystem. The steps include a new, trustless architecture, a native token, and the Seeker ship date.
According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. 
The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.
The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.
Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption.

SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transit…]]></summary>

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.
