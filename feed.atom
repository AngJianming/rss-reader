        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TypeScript - sounds familiar to another coding language called JavaScript, right? Well, it's a language based on JavaScript; the only difference is that it focuses on type safety. This makes it easier to catch errors before you run your code. This makes working on big projects easier to manage and improves the coding process by making it smoother and more reliable. Luckily, it's not too hard to learn as long as you have a basic understanding of JavaScript. JavaScript was created by Microsoft and released in October 2012
How do I start?
npm install typescript --save-dev
npm install @types/node --save-dev
npm install ts-node --save-dev

When you declare a variable, you need to declare the value type. If you've created a variable called box that is a boolean, you will declare it as a boolean.…]]></summary>

Stripe需要海外公司，paypal也需要有企业资质，其他的貌似要么需要企业身份，或者流程很麻烦，容易被拒。
我在开发(oeneo ai)的时候，一度卡在了支付这一块。国内独立开发者的独立站产品想要面向海外，收款支付是必须考虑的一块。
creem.io 是无意间在twitter上看到有人推荐，可能是因为刚起步，所以审核流程比较简单，并且支持支付宝直接收款，省去了银行卡这一步骤（也可以使用银行卡）。 我实际尝试下来确实很丝滑。
访问creem.io进行注册，支持谷歌帐号。注册完之后可以直接添加产品. 产品描述这里可以用markdown格式文本。产品类别只能选数字产品或者saas服务，支持一次性支付和订阅制。

下面这张图是产品支付页面详情，当时我截取这张图是为了看一下产品页面最后会怎么呈现给用户的。在下面这张图里，左侧上方“Basic Tier”是产品名字，中间是图片（可以省略），最下面是描述，大概就是这样一个布局。

产品填写页面有一个按钮 Price includes tax, 我理解是打开之后自动处理税务问题？（这一块不是特别清楚，有了解的大佬可以请教一下）

可配置的高阶功能：
设置免费体验时间，比如设置7天，那么7天内用户可无条件取消，7天以后才会真正扣款。
自定义变量： 这里主要用于付款成功之后发送给回调函数里的自定义变量，可以在代码里请求支付的时候设置





  
  
  激活账户


这是最重要的一步，但是实际应该放在最后面，等网站开发得差不多了再申请。因为一旦申请，creem会对网站进行严格得审查，如果不通过，可能需要几个月时间才能第二次申请。
再申请之前需要仔细阅读creem的帐号review政策https://docs.creem.io/faq/account-…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Inngest?


Inngest is an event-driven background job platform designed to work seamlessly with modern frameworks and serverless environments. It allows you to build durable, asynchronous workflows using events and functions, similar to AWS Step Functions, but with a more developer-friendly DX.
Event-based: Trigger functions using custom events (user.signed_up, order.placed, etc.).
Durable workflows: Built-in retries, step execution, and time-based delays.


Local development: Use the Inngest Dev Server to test workflows without deploying.


Framework-agnostic: Works with Next.js, Express, and other frameworks.


Strong typing: Full TypeScript support for event payloads and responses.

Amjad Masad 
(CEO of Repit)
I’ve been coding for about 16 years and working professionally for over a decade. After months of testing AI-assisted tools and “vibe coding” in early 2025, I can confidently say: that statement couldn’t be further from the truth.
Sure, LLMs have pulled off some amazing things. And if you don’t know what it really takes to build working software, it’s easy to think the old way is now obsolete.
But trust me, it’s not.
Let’s take a look at things that have happened before, because this is not the first time we face a statement like this; back in the late 50’s - early 60’s COBOL emerged stating that it would allow people without traditional programming backgrounds ( like business professionals, managers, and analysts ) …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Concurrency VS Synchronization



  
  
  Synchronous code


When code executes line by line in order, one thing at a time is called synchronous. It is simple, but sometimes might not be very efficient.
func main() {
    // block 1
    x := 10
    x++
    fmt.Printf("x = %d", x)

    // block 2
    y := 20
    y--
    fmt.Printf("y = %d", y)
}

Check the code blocks in the above example. As you can see, the code lines in block 1 should execute in order. The code lines in block 2 should also execute line by line. But blocks 1 and 2 have no dependency on each other. So, we can run them separately on two CPU cores. This is called running in Parallel. It increases efficiency.
In Golang, it is easy to write concurrent code.
func main() {
    // some code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem description & analysis:


The ID field of a certain database table is used for sorting, the logic field is used for conditional judgment, and val is used for segmented accumulation.

Task: Now we need to add a calculated column output. When logic==true, output is set to 1. Otherwise, output is accumulated and the value is the output of the previous row + val.

SQL：
with table1 as (
SELECT *, countif(logic) over win1 as logic_run
FROM example_data
window win1 as (order by id rows between unbounded preceding and current row)
)
SELECT *,
sum(val) over win2 as sum_over,
sum(if(logic,1,val)) over win2 as output
from table1
window win2 as (partition by logic_run order by id rows between unbounded preceding and current row)

SQL requires multiple window functions and subqueries to indirectly implement cumulative calculations, which is cumbersome in terms of code.
SPL: SPL provides syntax of relative positions that allows for direct accumulation.
✍🏻 Try.DEMO

A1： Load data.
A2： Add a calculated column, if logic is true, set it to 1; Otherwise, set it as the output of the previous row + val. [-1] represents the previous row.

Although Google Guava’s EventBus is already quite convenient, I wanted to build something more extensible — a component that not only functions as an EventBus but also supports delayed events out of the box.
While exploring the Apache DolphinScheduler project, I found its built-in eventbus component to be a well-written and efficient solution. It inspired me to extract and adapt it for use in our own business systems.
Thanks to DolphinScheduler’s open-source nature, this component can now be conveniently reused with minimal overhead. Let’s walk through how to extract it and run a working demo.
First, we define a base interface for all events:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democrat Senators blocked an attempt to move the bill forward earlier in May over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 20.
Several Democrats changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it's a “fair target” to have the GENIUS Act passed by May 26 — Memorial Day in the US.

The GENIUS Act was introduced on Feb. 4 by US Senator Bill Hagerty and seeks to regulate the nearly $250 billion stablecoin market — currently dominated by Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC).
The bill requires stablecoins be fully backed, have regular security audits and approval from federal or state regulators. Only licensed entities can issue stablecoins, while algorithmic stablecoins are restricted.
Several Democratic senators withdrew support for the bill on May 8, blocking a motion to move it forward, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump’s crypto ventures and anti-money laundering provisions.

The bill was revised soon after to receive enough bipartisan support to proceed to a vote.
Hagerty’s stablecoin bill builds on the discussion draft he submitted for former Representative Patrick McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act in October.

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

The buys take Quantum’s total cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a May 19 press release. The biotech company plans to stake a portion of its crypto to generate revenue. 
Quantum expects that holding a treasury of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets will “provide a return on investment for shareholders and […] provide some hedge against the Canadian dollar,” it said. 
Shares of Quantum’s stock, QNTM, rose by approximately 25% following the announcement, according to data from Google Finance.

In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator  would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.
“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:

“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”

The Canary CRO Trust will hold the Cronos (CRO) token in a regulated fund wrapper, Crypto.com said, adding that the trust is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and is only available to accredited investors.

Strategy and Metaplanet continue to accumulate Bitcoin, adding steady buy-side pressure to BTC price. 

Select altcoins have pulled back, but they have not yet turned negative.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.
“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.

Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.

Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.

Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply clus…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price fell 1.4% to $102,460 amid US economic concerns, with daily trading volume up 94%, indicating the return of sellers.

Moody’s US credit downgrade to Aa1 and a class-action lawsuit against Strategy add to BTC’s headwinds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by over 1.4% over the last 24 hours to $102,460 as concerns over the health of the US economy sour investor sentiment. Its daily trading volume has jumped by 94% to $66.6 billion, suggesting that the sell-side activity is intensifying.

Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.
Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.
Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto's core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.
