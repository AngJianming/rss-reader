        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is no longer a silver bullet. Threat actors have evolved. If your security model ends at "just enable MFA"—you’ve already lost.
This article dives deep into how modern attackers:
Bypass MFA using fatigue and phishing

Hijack sessions via stolen tokens

Exploit SAML/SSO trust relationships

Target enterprise environments through DevOps blind spots







  
  
  TL;DR




MFA fatigue (push bombing) targets human behavior, not code.


Token/session hijacking bypasses MFA after it’s been completed.


SAML/SSO can be abused if tokens or trust chains are intercepted.


DevOps pipelines are rarely hardened for lateral movement via session theft.

One password isn’t enough. Not in 2025. Not with phishing, data leaks, and account hijacking on the rise every year. It doesn’t matter if you're a software engineer, gamer, small business owner, or just someone trying to keep their email safe—if you’re not using multi-factor authentication (MFA) yet, you’re an easy target.
In this article, we’ll break down:
What MFA (and 2FA) actually is

Real-world attacks MFA would have stopped

How to set up MFA on Google, Microsoft, and more

The best MFA methods (and what to avoid)

Why it matters even on “non-important” accounts

Why Joyl?
After years of exploring various programming languages, I noticed a recurring problem:
What is Joyl?
Joyl is a modern hybrid programming language designed to:
Provide high performance with low-level control when needed.
Maintain clean, expressive syntax that's friendly to beginners.
Ensure safe memory management without relying on a garbage collector.
Offer flexible typing (with room for both static and dynamic typing).
Support concurrent and asynchronous programming out of the box.
Be extensible, future-ready, and suitable for scripting, backend, and even systems-level programming.
Language Goals
Fast like C, readable like Python.
Powerful like Rust, without overwhelming the developer.
Minimalistic core with room to grow.
Designed to be practical and enjoyable.

English isn’t my first language, so reading and understanding the questions took extra effort. Time management was especially tough.
But if I want to work in an English-speaking environment, this is something I need to get used to. Recently, I’ve also noticed that my reading speed has slowed down—even in Japanese—so this exam helped me realize an area I need to improve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have created two classes: one is a Controller, and the other is a Service.
The Controller class is annotated with @RestController, and the Service class is annotated with @Service. These annotations are recognized by Spring to identify which class serves as a Controller and which one acts as a Service.
Both @Controller and @Service are meta-annotated with @Component, which means Spring will automatically detect and create objects (beans) for these classes during component scanning.
In the Controller class, I used the @Autowired annotation to inject the Service class, allowing the Controller to call the service layer methods.
In the Controller, I am using the @RestController annotation. This is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. It indicates that the return value of the methods should be bound to the web response body, making it suitable for REST APIs.
In Spring Boot, the @PostMapping annotation maps HTTP POST requests to a specific handler method in the Controller. It's a shortcut for @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST) and is commonly used to create new resources on the server.
When using Postman, we send input in JSON format. However, Java doesn't have a direct "JSON" type. To handle this, I created a Student POJO class with appropriate getter and setter methods. The @RequestBody annotation is used to automatically map the incoming JSON data to the Java Student object.
@RestController
@Autowired
private StudentService studentService;

@PostMapping("/studentDetails")
public Student studentDetails(@RequestBody Student student) {
    studentControllerlog.debug("Inside student controller");
    return studentService.processStudent(student);
}

Since last year, I have wanted to find more ways to integrate AI into my blog. So far, I’ve used AI to help write posts, research posts, cross-post, and generate hero images. Of those, cross-posting is the only process that runs fully autonomously. To enrich the site experience and require less manual input from me, I came up with the idea of using embeddings to find similar posts for each article.
One idea I had was to use embeddings for creating a "Similar Posts" component. The idea was inspired by Hashnode's "More Articles" component displayed at the bottom of posts.

The Hashnode component is interesting, but it seems to only display the three most recent articles. While taking some visual inspiration from it, my "Similar Posts" component instead uses text embeddings and…]]></summary>

According to an announcement from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — a non-profit organization that advocates for universal human rights and individual liberty, and the host of the Oslo Freedom Forum — Durov will still deliver his keynote address remotely over a livestream.
“It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen said.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows.

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. 
Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the …]]></summary>

On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…]]></summary>

The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

Hackers targeting centralized entities have a "massive" return on investment (ROI) and are incentivized to hack centralized targets that contain millions of valuable records, the CEO told Cointelegraph. Barak added that …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semler Scientific, a medical device company, purchased of $50 million worth of Bitcoin between May 13 and May 22, bringing the market value of the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to $474.4 million, keeping it within the top 13 of BTC Treasury companies.
According to a May 23 disclosure, Semler bought a total of 455 BTC for an average purchase price of $109,801. To buy the Bitcoin, Semler Scientific used proceeds from an at-the-market stock offering program. So far, the company has sold roughly 3 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of $115 million.
Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor's Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.

In a May 22 X post, Abbott posted a Techstory article about Texas state lawmakers’ efforts to create a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve. The story pointed out that the decision for the passage of SB 21, the bill in question, now rests on Abbott’s shoulders, roughly three months after it was introduced. 
Since taking office, Abbott referred to himself as a “crypto law proposal supporter” in 2021 and suggested that he would support policies to establish Texas as a “crypto capital” in 2024. Texas was one of a handful of state-level governments that proposed setting up a strategic crypto reserve after the 2024 federal elections.

Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.
Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
