DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations to ensure smooth, reliable, and continuous software delivery. If you're considering a career as a DevOps Engineer, it's important to understand the role, the skills you'll need, and how it differs from other tech positions.
To become a DevOps Engineer, these are some of the skills you will need:
Programming and Scripting Languages – such as Python, Bash, Go, or Ruby for automating tasks.


Automation Tools – Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI to streamline builds and deployments.


Containerization – using Docker and orchestrating with Kubernetes.

The game is simple but captures the core mechanics of classic Mario games. You can extend it by adding more levels, power-ups, or improving the graphics with sprite images instead of the simple shapes I've used.
Enjoy playing your Mario game!

Not with violence. With image.
Over time, a single figure starts to embody not just authority, but identity. Speeches turn to symbols. Presence turns to permanence. And a nation begins to echo a face more than a voice.
This quiet reflection explores how political branding can reshape a country's sense of self. It doesn't assign blame. It simply observes what happens when national identity stops evolving and starts orbiting around legacy.
What happens when democracy keeps its systems but loses its plurality?
If you've seen this pattern in history, politics, or even in organizational culture, I’d love to hear your thoughts.]]></summary>

Welcome to the reality check most remote employers didn’t ask for but desperately need.
Hiring remotely in 2025 is not the same as it was during the pandemic. While the world pivoted to Zoom calls and Slack channels, an entire ecosystem of identity fraud quietly evolved in the background. This is the kind of fraud that bypasses LinkedIn checks, fools HR software, and looks squeaky clean. That is, until your codebase or finances are in the hands of someone who doesn’t even live in the country you thought they did.

IAM is Critical (And Confusing)
Identity and Access Management (IAM) is AWS's security foundation, but it's also one of the most complex services. I initially granted broad permissions to avoid errors, which is a dangerous approach.
Best practice: Follow the principle of least privilege. Start restrictive and add permissions as needed.

What is website downtime?
Website downtime refers to the time when your website is unavailable to visitors. The website is either not accessible at all or unable to complete its primary task (product purchases, etc.). 
Maximizing website uptime is critical to a successful business, so it is essential to minimize downtime. Planned downtime is often necessary, and you can inform customers about upcoming downtime, such as planned site maintenance.
