        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Integrating Stripe into a SvelteKit application, especially when dealing with dynamic product pricing and robust webhook validation, can be challenging. While building a client's business application using SvelteKit and PostgreSQL (with Drizzle ORM), I encountered the need for a streamlined integration with Stripe. The goal was to use minimal dependencies while supporting features such as dynamic pricing, product images, and secure payment verification via webhooks, all without requiring database updates. This article provides a comprehensive guide to this entire process, addressing a gap in existing resources. It should be noted that we cover the concepts here, and as a result, it's framework agnostic. You can use NextJS or NuxtJS in place of SvelteKit since they support se…]]></summary>

Here's what blew my mind: those people who seem to pick things up effortlessly aren't actually learning faster. They've just cracked the code on how learning actually works. And once you understand this process, everything changes.
After struggling through countless skills myself, I've noticed learning always follows the same pattern. It's like climbing a mountain with four distinct camps:
Stage 1: The Information Dump
Stage 2: The Lightbulb Moments
Stage 3: The Confidence Builder
Stage 4: The Magic Zone
If you're struggling right now, I want you to know something: you're not slow, you're not stupid, and you're definitely not broken. The problem is that most people don't realize where they are in this process, so they keep using the wrong approach for their current stage.
Here's what I've learned after watching hundreds of people master new skills: the ones who seem "naturally gifted" aren't necessarily smarter. They've just developed clarity about their learning process. They know where they are, what they need to work on next, and they show up consistently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To scrape all images from a single page using curl only, you're limited to sites(Memes apk) where images are directly embedded in the HTML (not loaded via JavaScript). Here's a step-by-step guide using only curl and basic Unix tools:
Step-by-Step: Scraping Images Using curl



  
  
  🧰 Requirements:



curl
grep, sed, or awk


wget or another method to download the images
curl -L https://memes-apk.com > page.html

-L follows redirects.
Save the page to a file.
grep -Eo 'https://[^"]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)' page.html > image-urls.txt

This command looks for https://... URLs ending in image extensions.
You can also refine it if the images are relative paths:
grep -Eo 'src="[^"]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)"' page.html | sed 's/src="//;s/"$//' > image-urls.txt

If the URLs are relative (like /images/meme.png), prepend the domain:
sed -i 's|^/|https://memes-apk.com/|' image-urls.txt

wget -i image-urls.txt

This downloads all the images from the list.
If you want it done in a single line (for simpler sites):
curl -s https://memes-apk.com | grep -Eo 'https://[^"]+\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)' | xargs -n 1 wget

curl:



It does not run JavaScript, so you won’t get images loaded dynamically.
It does not crawl multiple pages — just the one you provide.
curl)


If you want to crawl multiple pages recursively, use wget:
wget -r -l2 -nd -H -A jpg,jpeg,png,gif -e robots=off https://memes-apk.com

Do you want help writing a shell script that does this automatically for all pages or categories?]]></summary>

Tianjin Universityの研究
paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18243
https://zenn.dev/knowledgesense/arti./cles/10b2b5f772b810
【社会課題】
search-o1 と同じ

図２にDualRAGの全体像を示す。DualRAGは推論の文脈や進行状況に応じて検索を行うReasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ)、思考過程を記述し新しい知識を構造化しながら統合するprogressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA)の２プロセスから成る。
Rt,Dt=RaQ(Kt−1,x,Rt−1)
R_t, D_t = \text{RaQ}(K_{t-1}, x, R_{t-1})
Rt​,Dt​=RaQ(Kt−1​,x,Rt−1​)





  Kt=pKA(Kt−1,Dt)
K_t = \text{pKA}(K_{t-1}, D_t)
Kt​=pKA(Kt−1​,Dt​)



ここで

  KtK_t Kt​

 は

  tt t

反復目の知識、

  RtR_t Rt​

は推論過程、

  DtD_t Dt​

は取得した文書集合、

  xx x

はクエリ文を示す。
重要な情報はエンティティ集合

  EtE_t Et​

の周辺にあることが事前検証でわかっているため、エンティティごとに関連する文書を検索するためのクエリ集合

  QtQ_t Qt​

をセットで生成する。
Et, Qt(e)e∈Et=MEI(Kt−1,x,rt)
E_t,\ { Q_t(e) }{e \in E_t} = M{EI}(K_{t-1}, x, r_t)
Et​, Qt​(e)e∈Et​=MEI(Kt−1​,x,rt​)



クエリ集合でそれぞれ検索を行い、結果をマージ後にリランキングを行う。
KS(Knowledge Summarizer) はドキュメントの関連性に基づきフィルタリングを行ったのちに、エンティティごとに必要十分な知識を残して圧縮した knowledge fragment 

  kek_e ke​

 を生成する。
ke=MKS(x,Rt,e,Qt(e),De)k_e = M_{KS}(x, R_t, e, Q_t(e), D_e)

ke​=MKS​(x,Rt​,e,Qt​(e),De​)



PKO(Progressive Knowledge Outline)は「思考の履歴を自然言語で書き残す知識メモ」のようなもので、それをモデルが逐次的に活用していく。知識メモの形式は適用するビジネス領域に依存する面があるが、本研究では最も基本的なテキストのリストとする。
Kt(e)=Kt−1(e)∪keK_t(e) = K_{t-1}(e) \cup { k_e }

Kt​(e)=Kt−1​(e)∪ke​




  
  
  3.2 Fine-Tuning for Compact Models


ハイエンドなLLMは利用コストも高いため、ロウエンドモデルを Finetune もしくは知識蒸留して用いる。HotpotQAデータセットをベースとし、GPTで元の質問に対して「中間質問・中間回答文・答え」の形式で複数ステップを生成。

集めたデータセットのサンプルは数 Table.1 である。
評価指標はEM、F1に加え、検索精度や推論一貫性も個別に評価した。

従来のRAG手法との比較はTable.2であり、複数のデータセット、評価指標でSOTAであることがわかる。

各プロセスに対するアブレーションスタディはTable.3である。w/o R は reasoner が検索を使用しない、w/o EI は Entity の検出をしない、w/o KO はKnowledge outlineを使用しない設定である。実験結果ではどれも性能が低下しており、有効なプロセスであることがわかる。
最後にケーススタディを掲載する。]]></summary>

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Top Bitcoin (BTC) bulls in 2025 have updated their price forecasts, and they range from a relatively cautious $130,000 to seven-figure moonshots.
Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. 
Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

Gooner EMA is a technical indicator created by trader NebraskanGooner that uses the 11- and 22-period exponential moving averages (EMA). When the price crosses above the EMA range, it often leads to further gains.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release.
The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years.

Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.
The vote is part of a broader recovery plan that includes using Cetus’s treasury and securing an emergency loan from the Sui Foundation.

In a May 28 announcement, the company said it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nasdaq has filed for crypto asset manager 21Shares to list a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, initiating the Securities and Exchange Commission’s review process.
The stock market’s May 23 19b-4 filing, which asks the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, follows 21Shares’ April 30 submission of its S-1 registration statement to the SEC, which asked the regulator to approve trading of the proposed fund.
Both regulatory filings are needed for the Sui (SUI) tracking fund to go live, with the 19b-4 filing kicking off the SEC’s review process. The agency must decide whether to accept, reject or delay the application within 45 days and it can delay its decision multiple times, for a maximum review period of 240 days.
