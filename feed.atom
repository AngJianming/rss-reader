In the previous series of articles, we started with building the development environment, talked about how to use and integrate third-party plug-ins, how to transform existing projects into Harmony, and how to review them; we also took the use of Amap's HarmonyOS SDK as an example to explain how to integrate Amap into the project.
In addition to using Flutter projects as the main project development, there is another common development method, namely hybrid development. The main project project is the HarmonyOS project, and the Flutter project exists in the form of a module, which is loaded into the main project project in a dependent manner, and finally realizes hybrid development.
Presumably, hybrid development will not be unfamiliar, because we have also briefly introduce…]]></summary>

If you remember Windows Vista's Aero Glass aesthetic translucent panes, glowing edges, and glassy blurs, this might feel like history repeating itself.
But Apple's take isn't just nostalgia; it's refinement.
Let's rewind.
Vista's Aero Glass was ambitious for its time (2006), introducing frosted translucency, window blur, and fluid motion. The problem? Hardware limitations. It was heavy on resources, inconsistent in UX, and often felt more gimmick than utility.

Fast forward to 2025, and Apple's Liquid Glass builds on the same core idea: translucency, depth, and light — but with far more nuance and purpose:

These features have driven innovation across industries, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to supply chain management.
However, this same transparency can become a significant challenge when it comes to data privacy and confidentiality. Sensitive information is often exposed on public blockchains, creating a tension between openness and privacy that limits what kinds of applications can be safely and securely built.
This article explores the heart of this problem  and how the Oasis Network is uniquely solving it with its Sapphire runtime and the ROFL framework, unlocking new horizons for secure, scalable, and private Web3 applications.

When I started learning Dynamic Programming (DP), I thought I had it all figured out.
First write recursion ->
Easy, right?
So whenever I saw a tough problem, my brain immediately went:

"Where’s the recursion? Let's add dp[i][j] and go"
That's how I thought DP was supposed to be.
But recently, I solved a problem... and it broke that pattern completely.
No recursion.

No DP array.

No i, no j, no table.  
Still, it felt like Dynamic Programming.

And that's when I paused and asked myself:
“Wait… is this even DP?”
Turned out, it was. Just in disguise.
That's when I realized:
DP isn't just about writing recursion and caching it.

It's more about spotting repeated work and finding smart ways to reuse it.

last night i slept in my parents room and they turn off the ac so earlyin the morning. i woke up drenched in sweat and my mother screaming at my face. then my sissys went to their morning coaching and return late so we had chapattis with morning's veggie and soupy maggie. papa is in her general duty and we all are hungry right now, and no one is listening to my moma, all she wants is 3 liters of milk from the market and some veggies to cook.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throughout my learning journey with Microsoft Excel, I have acquired a wide range of valuable skills that have greatly enhanced my data management and analysis capabilities. I began by learning how to sort and filter data, allowing me to quickly organize large datasets and extract relevant information efficiently. I also explored data validation, which helps ensure the accuracy and consistency of data entries by setting predefined rules and restrictions. Moving further, I mastered conditional formatting, a powerful feature that visually highlights specific data points based on given conditions, making trends and anomalies immediately apparent.
In addition to these foundational skills, I explored into operators and logical functions, including the versatile IF statements and more complex nested IF functions, enabling me to automate decision-making processes within spreadsheets. I also became proficient with lookup functions such as VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP, which simplify the task of searching for data across different tables. Furthermore, I advanced to using the INDEX and MATCH functions, which offer greater flexibility and efficiency in retrieving data compared to traditional lookup functions. 
To summarize and analyze data more effectively, I learned to create pivot tables and charts, transforming raw data into meaningful summaries and visual representations. Finally, I explored how to build interactive dashboards, which combine multiple Excel features to present dynamic, user-friendly reports that provide valuable insights at a glance. This comprehensive skill set has empowered me to handle complex data tasks with confidence and precision.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In development, it’s easy to overlook the little things.
A renamed variable.

A changed loop condition.

A one-line regex tweak.

A quick copy-paste “fix” you promised you'd revisit (but didn’t).
At the moment, it feels small—insignificant even. But here’s the truth every seasoned developer learns eventually:
Tiny changes can ripple into massive consequences.
One Line, Ten Headaches


You change a > to a >= in a pagination check.

Suddenly, a batch of records starts duplicating, and no one notices until it reaches production.
You hardcode a string instead of creating a constant.

Months later, someone updates the value in one place but not another—and now you have a silent data inconsistency.
It wasn’t wrong, per se. But it wasn’t thoughtful either.
Compound Interest of Good Decisions


This isn’t just about mistakes. Small positive changes matter too.
A consistent naming convention that saves future developers hours of guesswork.


Adding a helpful comment that prevents a misinterpretation months later.


Refactoring a repetitive block into a clean function that scales with the app.



These things don’t make headlines. But they make life so much easier down the road.
Why the Small Stuff Matters


Codebases don’t break because of one dramatic failure. They degrade slowly—one careless change at a time.

They also grow stronger—one intentional improvement at a time.
The best developers aren’t just those who write the most code.

They’re the ones who respect the weight of every line.
Have you ever made a small change that led to a major bug or breakthrough?


What habits have helped you spot and respect the ripple effect in your code?


How can we better train junior devs to understand that "little things" aren’t always little?



Because in software—as in life—the smallest decisions often make the biggest difference.]]></summary>

Project Title:
Chessboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Project Description:
Today, I built a simple 8x8 Chessboard using HTML, CSS Grid, and JavaScript DOM manipulation. This project helped me understand how to create dynamic elements using JavaScript and apply CSS classes conditionally.
Important JavaScript Topics Covered:
1.DOM Manipulation:
document.createElement() to create div elements dynamically.
2.Loops (For Loop):
for loops generated 8 rows and 8 columns for the chessboard.
3.Conditional Statements (if-else):
(row + col) % 2 == 0 to create the chess pattern.
4.setAttribute() Method:
id and class attributes dynamically for each square.
5.CSS Grid:
grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 60px);

This made 8 columns of equal size.
