        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to share how I felt on my first day in Chennai and how my journey is going as I begin to learn Java Full Stack Development.
On the first day, I was honestly very nervous. Everything around me felt new the people, the slang, the language, the food, even the small decisions I had to make for myself. It was all different from what I was used to. But something good happened I made a new friend on day one, and that gave me a little bit of comfort in this new place.
As a new student in the class, I met many new faces. That day, I heard about Linux for the first time. We were asked to install Linux Mint, and I had absolutely no idea how to do it. For 3 to 4 days, I kept researching and trying to understand how Linux works. With the help of a senior batch student, I finally learned how to install it. I gained a little knowledge, and that small confidence helped me guide others too. Even though I struggled at first, I eventually figured it out fully and it felt really good.
Later, our trainer started teaching us HTML and CSS, and how to build our own portfolio website. I started reading many tags and understanding how websites are structured. The session was very useful, and we were able to clear our doubts. I really enjoyed that class.
Every afternoon, we have a communication session. On the first day, the topic was a self-introduction. After that, each day brings a new topic. These sessions are actually fun and helpful, because they push us to talk with others, share our thoughts, and improve our communication skills naturally.
Whenever we get bored or need a break, we play shuttle and other little games. I'm also slowly exploring nearby food spots and trying new things. I’m really eager to learn, not just about coding, but everything around me.
Now, I feel like I’ve taken a big step toward my dream of becoming a software developer. I’m still learning, still growing, but I’m truly excited about this journey and looking forward to everything that’s coming next.]]></summary>

Whether you're building a web app, desktop tool, or mobile solution, your choice of model can significantly affect the outcome. Most businesses today rely on expert software development services to ensure that their process is both efficient and adaptable to changing requirements. But before you dive in, it's essential to understand which development methodology suits your project best.
Waterfall Model
This traditional model follows a linear sequence — from requirements to design, development, testing, and deployment. It's best for projects with well-defined goals and minimal expected changes. However, it lacks flexibility once a phase is complete.

I recently shared why I’m stepping off the whiteboard and back into the terminal. Today I’m introducing how that journey becomes real: a public project called Bugle Call.
Bugle Call is a purpose-built architecture lab.

It mimics the concerns platform teams handle every day:
Incident ingestion under burst and idle load

Asynchronous processing with enrichment and ML tagging

Secure dashboards for incident trends and cost insights

Observability that measures health and spending

GitOps delivery across dev, staging, and production

Multi-cloud deployment on kind, AKS, and EKS
The stack mixes .NET, Go, Python, React, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, and Kubecost.

Raw payloads land in MongoDB for audit and model training. Structured data lives in PostgreSQL for queries.
Depth over theory – real code and live clusters reveal trade-offs that diagrams hide.


Breadth with purpose – every component teaches a specific skill: IAM, GitOps, cost telemetry, or AI enrichment.


Public proof-of-work – architecture credibility grows when anyone can clone, run, and break your design.

This week is relatively calm in the React ecosystem, but we still have various interesting blog posts and releases. Maybe we'll soon get some exciting news from React Summit that's about on Friday!
On the React Native side, all the devs are already working on iOS 26 Liquid Glass support and other things announced by Apple yesterday. This new design thing is rather controversial and subject to a lot of mockery 😂. React Native 0.80 is just around the corner, I'll keep all this for later, but you can get a sneak peek in Alex Hunt talk at App.js.
The JS ecosystem has been rather active with Oxlint 1.0 and various interesting Node.js news.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outreach isn't just for marketers anymore.
But in 2025, outreach has evolved—and it's surprisingly developer-friendly.
You might be thinking:
I'm not in sales. Why should I care about outreach?"
Here’s why:
You want contributors for your open-source project 
You’re looking for tech talks, podcasts, or speaking gigs 
You’re building a product and need beta users or feedback 
You’re job hunting or exploring freelance/consulting gigs 
Outreach = opportunity. When done right, it opens doors without feeling spammy.
🔧 Outreach That Works for Developers
Don’t start with “Can you do X for me?”
Mention shared interests, GitHub repos, or tech stacks—but keep it respectful and relevant.
While cold emails work, devs are often more responsive on:
GitHub Issues/PRs
Twitter (X) replies
DEV comments
Discord/Slack communities
Tech folks appreciate clarity. Get to the point. Include links, context, and what you’re offering or asking—without fluff.
Don't just reach out when you need something.
In 2025, outreach isn’t about spamming inboxes. It’s about authentic, thoughtful connection—especially in the dev world.
Whether you’re a junior dev, indie hacker, or lead engineer: building real relationships can take your career (and projects) further than you think.
How do you approach outreach as a developer?

At small scale, you can use a hash set or a map to keep track. These give you lightning-fast lookups. But try storing a billion SHA-256 hashes — that's 32GB of raw memory. And that’s just the hashes, not the metadata, not the index, not the structure.
