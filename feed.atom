They are versatile in that they can fit small MVP workloads and large scalable enterprise systems.
However, like any other tool, they must be used properly and with best practices.
I’ve been building backend systems, for large and small companies, for over 6 years now and I’ll share with you some best practices and tips I’ve learned along the way.
Use this article as a guide for every time you create a new Lambda function, to make sure it follows the best practices in this list.
The first thing you should be configuring as soon as you create a new Lambda function is the memory and timeout settings.

On May 13, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wanted to quickly concatenate strings from a set in Python? You might already know join() works like a charm with lists, but did you know it quietly handles sets too?
Let's dive into this silent yet efficient technique.
Suppose you have a set of strings:
tech_tags = {"python", "dev", "tips"}

You want to concatenate them with a space or comma. If you're tempted to loop through them manually, there's a cleaner way.
result = " ".join(tech_tags)
print(result)

That's it! No need for extra loops or type conversions.
set is unordered, so the result order isn't guaranteed. But if you're just looking to concatenate them quickly — this works perfectly.
tools = {"numpy", "pandas", "matplotlib"}
print(", ".join(tools))

pandas, numpy, matplotlib  # (order may vary)

✅ join() works silently with sets.
✅ Clean and pythonic.
⚠️ Set order is not preserved.
🚀 Great for logging, quick display, or generating tag strings.
💬 Do you use this technique? Got a better way? Share your thoughts below!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why I Built Sona
Modern programming languages weren’t built with neurodivergent or first-time coders in mind. That’s a gap I couldn’t ignore.
As a self-taught developer, I spent years battling syntax errors, inconsistent tooling, and steep learning curves — not because I lacked motivation, but because the language design just wasn't made for brains like mine.
So I built Sona — an open-source programming language designed to simplify coding, reduce friction, and empower creativity.
What Makes Sona Unique?
Minimal, readable syntax (inspired by Python, Rust, and Go)
REPL-first development (Sona v0.4.3 just launched!)
Modules that feel native and expressive (import fs, stdin.input(), etc.)
Designed for focus + accessibility, including neurodivergent users
Fully open-source, interpreter built with Python + Lark
Current Progress
✅ Interpreter up to v0.4.3

✅ 12+ core modules complete (fs, http, json, env, stdin, etc.)

✅ REPL mode: multiline function support, :env commands, graceful errors

✅ Preparing for public alpha (v1.0)
Call to Action
This is your invitation to help shape the future of dev tooling.
👉 Try Sona. Star it. Fork it. Build something with it.

👉 Join our mission to make programming more inclusive.

Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“

The committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul on May 13, the local news agency News1 reported.

The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC).

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

A falling wedge breakout projects 40% gains ahead, but $2.80 may act as interim resistance.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

Web3 and privacy-focused web browser Brave Browser has integrated the Cardano blockchain into its native and standalone wallets.
According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:

The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.

Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

Dogecoin's 38% surge reflects strong market demand, with spot-buyer volumes taking charge since March. 

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.

Dogecoin's (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has warned that a hacker has again hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website.  
In the second attack on its infrastructure in a week, the “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” the team said in a May 12 warning to X.
In a follow-up post to a user asking whether it was a hack or a hijack, the Curve Team said the website “Points to the wrong IP” when users try to visit. A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses.
