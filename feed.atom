Imagine you're a cook (well… you are, kinda 😉)
You’ve never cooked before. No one taught you anything. You just jumped in the well , with nothing but a recipe and a list of ingredients.
Sounds easy , right?
But here’s the twist: the recipe book you’re following doesn’t tell you how much salt to add.
“Add according to taste.”
Now that’s where it gets tricky.
Because you don't know how much salt is perfect?
The funny thing is: dishes with the perfect amount of salt don’t taste salty — they just taste... right. Balanced. Delicious. Like they were always meant to be that way.
That's the taste of "just enough to be perfect."
Confused? Wondering why a game dev is suddenly talking about cooking?


But hear me out. I truly believe:

The goal was to apply architectural best practices using Service Objects to improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
Service Objects are simple classes used to organize business logic that doesn't belong directly in models, controllers, or views.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in practice, giving each part of the system a clearly defined role.
Use a Service Object when:
The logic is too complex to stay in the controller
The functionality doesn't naturally belong to a model
You need to reuse the same logic in multiple places
You want cleaner, more testable code

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.

• Definition: An interface is a reference type in Java, it is similar to a class, and it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants.
Abstract class:
 In Java, just like in C++ an instance of an abstract class cannot be created, we can have references to abstract class type though.
 Like C++, an abstract class can contain constructors in Java. And a constructor of an abstract class is called when an instance of an inherited class is created.
 In Java, we can have an abstract class without any abstract method. This allows us to create classes that cannot be instantiated but can only be inherited.
 Abstract classes can also have final methods (methods that cannot be overridden)
 For any abstract java class we are not allowed to create an object i.e., …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoisting in JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before execution, but the behavior varies between old (ES5) and modern (ES6+) JavaScript. In ES5, var variables are hoisted with undefined, and function declarations are fully hoisted, making them callable anywhere. In ES6+, let and const are hoisted but enter a Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ), causing errors if accessed before declaration. Arrow functions are not hoisted and must be declared before use. 
The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is the period where let and const variables are inaccessible until declared.
console.log(myVar); // undefined
console.log(myLet); // Error: Cannot access 'myLet' before initialization
console.log(myFunc()); // "I am a function!"
console.log(myArrow); // TypeError: myArrow is not a function

var myVar = "I am var!";
let myLet = "I am let!";
function myFunc() {
  return "I am a function!";
}
const myArrow = () => "I am an arrow function!";

Explanation:



myVar (with var) is hoisted with undefined.
myLet (with let) is in TDZ, causing a ReferenceError.
myFunc (function declaration) is fully hoisted and works.
myArrow (arrow function) is not hoisted, throwing a TypeError.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TypeScript is quickly becoming a must-have skill for modern web developers. One of the most fundamental things you need to understand to write effective TypeScript code is its type system. That’s why I created a new video to help you get up to speed with TypeScript data types — fast, clear, and with real examples.
🎥 Watch the full video here








  
  
  🚀 What You’ll Learn in the Video


In this beginner-focused tutorial, we break down the core data types in TypeScript and demonstrate how to use them in real-world scenarios.
string
number
boolean
array
tuple
enum
object
any
void
null
undefined
never
Each type is explained with hands-on code so you can understand the what, why, and when of using them. Whether you're transitioning from JavaScript or just starting your TypeScript journey, this video is perfect for you.
Unlike JavaScript, TypeScript allows you to define variable types explicitly. This:
Catches errors at compile time (before runtime!)
Makes your code easier to understand and maintain
Helps your IDE give better autocompletion and error hints
Enables teams to collaborate more effectively on large codebases
If you want to write robust applications, mastering data types is a foundational step.
This video is great for:
JavaScript developers transitioning to TypeScript
Coding bootcamp students
Self-taught programmers
Anyone looking to build scalable apps with strong typing

Procedurally drawing a sphere in WebGL is fascinating because, despite the underlying geometry remaining mathematically consistent, implementations diverge widely based on load constraints and polygon counts. This contrast is a paradox in itself—after all, a perfect sphere has no edges.
Procedurally generating high-quality 3D geometry for the web demands navigating a fine balance between visual elegance, computational efficiency, and seamless user experience. While traditional methods often depend on heavy libraries or complex pre-processing steps, the innovative "bitbanging" approach presented here revolutionizes this paradigm with its elegant simplicity, exceptional smoothness, and visually superior outcomes.

Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

DefiLlama states that major liquid restaking protocols now hold over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), with dozens of middleware services aligning their security with Ethereum’s economic base layer. What started as an idea to increase capital efficiency for validators has evolved into a serious attempt to redefine how security is provisioned across decentralized systems.
While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

The partnership, announced on May 1 at Token2049 in Dubai, will see the deployment of Ethena’s USDe (USDE) and Ethena Staked USDe (sUSDe) natively within the TON blockchain.
The sUSDe variant will be integrated under the name tsUSDe, enabling Telegram users to access US dollar-denominated savings directly within Telegram.

The deployment involves two major Ethena integrations, including one in the custodial Wallet in Telegram and the second in the TON Space wallet, a self-custodial wallet integrated in the messenger.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.
In a race where rivals are slashing transaction times and polishing user experiences, standing still isn’t an option. To hold its ground at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 as a whole, Ethereum must keep sharpening both its exe…]]></summary>

The lack of interoperability across blockchains means users need to create multiple wallets to interact with different networks, with users having at least two wallets rising by 16% over the past year. 
According to a research report published by onchain user experience platform Reown and crypto intelligence firm Nansen, 62% of crypto users reported using at least two wallets over the past three months, up from 45% in 2024.

The report, published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures.
Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters.

World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes.
