        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Devs 👋,
I’m working on Foodstagram, a social platform for discovering restaurants through community-driven reviews, photos, and foodie profiles — kind of like a blend of Yelp and Instagram, but food-focused 🍣📷.
Right now, I’ve got a super basic prototype built on Bubble, and it’s costing me around $40/month to keep it running.
I’m debating between:
Continuing with Bubble for faster development and iteration
Switching to a coded stack (e.g., React, Express, MongoDB) for more flexibility and scalability
I do have some coding experience, but time and team resources are tight. My main goal is to launch fast, test with real users, and eventually scale if things go well.
What would you recommend?
Thanks in advance 🙌

Ether breaks multimonth downtrend as traders target $3,000 ETH price.

Ethereum TVL surges 41% to $52.8 billion in 30 days, with a 22% rise in daily transactions to 1.34 million, signaling strong network recovery.

Technicals show ETH price faces major resistance at $2,100-$2,800.

Ether is setting up for a recovery toward the $3,000 psychological level, backed by recovering network activity, increasing TVL, and strong technicals. 
Ether price seeks a return to $3K
Ether (ETH) looks to end its downtrend that has been in play since mid-December after it turned away from its 10-month high of $4,100.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When managing Gradle projects, particularly those involving Kotlin, it's common to encounter the scenario where both a Gradle plugin and a dependency rely on the same version number. The question arises: how can you define a single variable that is accessible for both a plugin and a dependency in your build.gradle file?
Why This Issue Occurs
Gradle creates different scopes for different parts of the build configuration. The buildscript block is used to define classpath dependencies for the Gradle build itself, and variables defined there (like ext.kotlinVersion) aren't directly accessible in the dependencies block. This can lead to redundancy if the same version number needs to be specified in multiple places.
To overcome this limitation and avoid repetitive definitions, Kotlin users can f…]]></summary>

Let’s break it down.
Cyber threats today are far more sophisticated than in the past. Malware isn't just about viruses anymore — it's about:
Ransomware locking entire networks
Spyware silently stealing your data
Trojan horse pretending to be legit software
Zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities

Hello everyone! As Swift developers, we deal with data every day, and the conversion between JSON and models is undoubtedly a daily task. Apple provided us with the Codable protocol, which performs well in many situations, but as business logic becomes more complex, we often find ourselves stuck writing a lot of boilerplate code: manually defining CodingKeys, implementing init(from:) and encode(to:), handling nested structures, dealing with different naming styles, parsing various date formats... These tedious tasks are not only time-consuming but also error-prone.
Is there a more elegant and efficient way to handle Codable in Swift?

It's common to face UI positioning issues when developing applications in Kotlin, especially when working with camera views and dynamic layouts.

Let's dive into the potential causes of this issue and explore solutions together.
Understanding the Issue
The camera view in your Flutter app should ideally be confined to a specific area defined by the Positioned widget. However, many developers encounter scenarios where views don't render in the expected locations. This can happen due to several reasons, including:
Incorrect layout constraints.
Misconfigured AnimatedPositioned properties.

Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?

In a May 6 X post after court proceedings had likely ended for the day, Karony said he was innocent and “did not commit fraud” in response to media coverage of his trial. The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

The ETH futures premium has remained below the 5% neutral threshold, indicating a lack of appetite from leveraged bulls. More significantly, this indicator was unchanged at 3% after the Pectra upgrade, suggesting traders did not adjust thei…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.
