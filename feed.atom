        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Database schema changes are critical operations that require careful planning and execution. The ability to perform these changes safely and reliably is a key consideration when choosing a database management system. In this post, we'll compare how PostgreSQL 17 and MySQL 8 handle Data Definition Language (DDL) transactions, with a focus on atomicity and rollback capabilities.
Before diving into the comparison, let's clarify what we mean by DDL transactions. DDL statements can be grouped together and either committed as a unit or rolled back entirely if something goes wrong.
There are two important concepts to distinguish:
Transactional DDL: The ability to include DDL statements within a multi-statement transaction block, with the option to commit or roll back all statements together.

In programming, clarity and correctness are paramount. Types are the backbone of Rust's safety guarantees, but raw types like i32, String, or Vec<T> can sometimes lack semantic meaning and lead to subtle bugs when misused. Imagine accidentally swapping two integers meant for different purposes, like a user ID and a product ID, in a function call—there’s no compiler safeguard to catch that mistake.  
Enter type aliases and newtypes: two powerful tools for giving raw types clearer meaning and enforcing type safety. They help you write code that's easier to understand, harder to misuse, and safer overall. In this blog post, we'll explore these tools, illustrate their usage with practical examples, and discuss common pitfalls to avoid. B…]]></summary>

For many creatives and technical minds, the journey begins with freedom.
You ditch the 9–5.
Soon, every new client brings a new briefing process. New tools. New expectations. New ways of working. The very freedom you chased starts to vanish under a pile of calendar invites and Google Docs titled "v2_final_FINAL".
It's a trap: the custom-client loop.
And to escape it, you don't need to scale up. You need to scale down — into clarity.
This is how solo founders flip their project-based chaos into a repeatable, productized service — a system that runs smooth like SaaS, even if there's no code in sight.

That’s what Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solves for me.

Not just automation. Not just speed. Trust.
Most articles will tell you that IaC makes things faster

Sure, it does. Spinning up environments, codifying pipelines, standardizing infra.
But speed isn’t the reason. It’s a byproduct of something more important: systemic trust.
Teams don’t move fast because of automation.

Sourcing High-Quality Illustrations
Finding the right illustrations can really make a design pop. It's about finding that sweet spot between style, relevance, and quality. There are a bunch of plugins out there that give you access to illustration libraries right inside Figma. It can save a ton of time compared to hunting around on different websites.
Here's a quick rundown of things to consider:
License: Always double-check the usage rights. You don't want any surprises later on.
Style Consistency: Make sure the illustrations match the overall vibe of your project.

Introduction : In Angular development, managing API calls to multiple endpoints is common. Some endpoints may require an x-api-key for authentication, while others don’t. Instead of hardcoding headers in each service, Angular’s HttpInterceptor allows us to centralize request handling and apply API keys conditionally. Let’s explore how to implement this and the pros and cons of conditional key management. (For only readers Step 4is the important one)

Level: For everyone
Note: In this tutorial, we’ll build a simple Angular 19 application to fetch news articles using the Finlight.me News API . While this guide uses Finlight.me to demonstrate managing an x-api-key, you can easily adapt the approach for any API requiring custom headers. Our focus will be on creat…]]></summary>
