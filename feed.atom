        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cursor is now free for students!

If you're a student and haven’t tried Cursor yet, now’s the time. They just made their AI coding editor completely free for students. It’s like VS Code with an AI pair programmer built in and it actually understands your codebase (better than Copilot in my opinion!).
But here's the thing. Tools like Cursor aren't shortcuts to become a developer. They're multipliers. If you take the time to really learn how code works, tools like this make you faster and more effective. If you skip that part, you might get output, but not insight. Learn to think in code first. Then use AI to move quicker.
I use Cursor myself while building sliplane.io, my platform for hosting Docker apps. It saves time, but only because I know what I want it to do. The real leverage comes from combining good tools with solid understanding.
Cheers,
Jonas Co-Founder sliplane.io]]></summary>

Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed software development. AI-based tools—often called AI agents—act as programming assistants, automating repetitive tasks and offering contextual insights. Recent studies show significant enthusiasm among developers: for example, a Salesforce survey found that 96% of programmers expect AI to improve the coding experience, and 80% already consider AI agents essential in application development. Additionally, users report increased satisfaction and productivity: a GitHub survey found that 60–75% of Copilot users felt more fulfilled and focused on satisfying tasks, and 73% said the tool helps them stay in a productive flow. These numbers illustrate the growing role of AI in developers’ daily lives. In this context, we explore…]]></summary>

When we work with objects or arrays in JavaScript, we often need to copy them. But did you know there are two types of copies? 🧐
👉 Shallow Copy

👉 Deep Copy
Let’s understand both in simple words with a daily life example and easy code.
Imagine you have a recipe book 📖. You want to give the same recipe to your friend.
Shallow Copy → You give a photocopy of the recipe page, but it still points to your original notes at the bottom. So if you change your notes, your friend sees the change too. 📝➡️👯‍♂️


Deep Copy → You write down the recipe fully with your notes and give it to your friend. Now, your friend has a completely separate copy. Changes in your book won’t affect your friend’s copy. 📝➡️📄✍️

Why I Joined


I’m still figuring things out in tech. I didn’t start with a degree in computer science or a fancy job title. I just have a love for learning and a desire to grow. Kubernetes sounded complex, but also like something I needed to learn if I wanted to get better in cloud and DevOps.
So when I found this program, I decided to take the step, not because I knew everything, but because I was ready to learn.

Understanding the Performance Issue
Your current code iterates over the result set and performs an insert operation for each row individually. While this approach works, it can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with larger datasets. Each insert incurs a round-trip to the database, which can add significant latency.
Why This Happens
The database needs to handle multiple connections for each insert, which can be time-consuming. Furthermore, starting and committing transactions for multiple insert actions separately increases th…]]></summary>

A smart contract is just code that lives on the blockchain.
It automatically runs when specific conditions are met — no human, no admin, no delays.
Example:
If Alice sends 1 ETH to the contract, Bob receives 100 tokens.
Smart contracts are:

📜 Transparent (everyone can see the code)

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $95,000 and institutional adoption starting to catch on, the mood among investors has shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook. 
“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investors have been piling into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund for over three weeks straight, culminating in the asset’s run up to $97,000 on May 7.
The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen 16 days of inflows for the spot BTC ETF, with a further 280 Bitcoin (BTC) or around $36 million piling into the fund on May 6, according to HODL15Capital.  
The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added. 
“IBIT alone has done this in a few weeks, more than a year after launch.”
The BlackRock fund (IBIT) has seen around $4.7 billion in inflows since its last outflow day on Apri…]]></summary>

Lee announced his crypto promises on May 6 as part of a broader initiative to provide more investment opportunities for Korea’s youth, one of the main target demographics for the fast-approaching June 3 election.
“I will create a safe investment environment so that young people can [build] assets and plan for the future,” The Korea Economic Daily (KED) quoted Lee as saying in Korean.

“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.
