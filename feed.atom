        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI is no longer just a buzzword in the legal world—it's becoming a practical tool that law firms are using to dramatically speed up their workflows, especially when it comes to drafting motions, contracts, and legal research.
Faster Legal Research: Instead of spending hours combing through case law, attorneys are using AI-powered platforms like Lexis+ AI and Westlaw Precision to get contextual, relevant case summaries in seconds. These tools don’t just search—they understand legal language and deliver insights, saving valuable time.
Drafting Motions & Contracts: AI tools like Harvey, CoCounsel by CaseText, and Spellbook are helping lawyers generate first drafts of everything from simple demand letters to complex motions. These platforms suggest clauses, format citations, and even flag potential risks—making it easier to move from outline to final draft in a fraction of the time.
Smarter Document Review: AI-powered review tools can now analyze contracts, flag missing provisions, and compare documents against standard templates. This is especially useful for due diligence, compliance checks, and M&A work.
Efficiency = Profitability: For law firms, time is literally money. By using AI to reduce manual work, they can focus on higher-level strategic thinking, serve more clients, and maintain accuracy under pressure.
AI isn’t replacing lawyers—it’s helping them work faster, smarter, and more effectively. The firms adopting these tools today are gaining a competitive edge in both service quality and speed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're starting with Rust, you've probably heard about Cargo. It’s the official package manager and build system for Rust, and it handles almost everything you need to get your Rust project up and running—from compiling code to managing dependencies. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how dependency management works using Cargo.toml.
Cargo.toml?


When you create a new Rust project using the command:
cargo new my_project

Cargo sets up a new project directory with a file called Cargo.toml. This file is the heart of your project configuration. It contains metadata about your project—like its name, version, and authors—and, more importantly, a list of dependencies.
Here’s a simplified example of what a Cargo.toml might look like:
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"

I wanted to celebrate the joy and playfulness of National Donut Day through a purely CSS-driven illustration. Donuts are universally loved and instantly recognizable, so recreating one with only HTML and CSS felt like a fun test of creativity and technique. Drawing a frosted donut with colorful sprinkles allowed me to experiment with CSS gradients, shape techniques (using border-radius), and pseudo-elements for sprinkles. The challenge to avoid any images or JavaScript pushed me to think deeply about how CSS alone can convey a rich, mouth-watering design.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Artificial intelligence systems don't exist in a vacuum. Every algorithm, every neural network, and every machine learning model carries within it the invisible fingerprints of human bias. As we increasingly rely on AI for critical decisions—from hiring employees to diagnosing diseases—understanding how machines absorb and amplify our prejudices has become one of the most pressing challenges in technology ethics.
The relationship between human bias and machine learning isn't simply a technical problem to be solved with better code. It's a fundamental reflection of how our societies think, categorize, and make judgments about the world around us.
Machine learning algorithms learn patterns from historical data, but this data often contains embedded societal biases. When we feed these datasets to AI systems, we're essentially teaching machines to perpetuate the same discriminatory patterns that exist in human society.
Historical data reflection - Past hiring, lending, or judicial decisions embedded in training datasets
Labeling inconsistencies - Human annotators applying subjective judgments during data preparation
Representation gaps - Underrepresentation of certain demographic groups in training data
Proxy discrimination - Using seemingly neutral variables that correlate with protected characteristics

As part of an ongoing research project and upcoming publication, I'm running a short survey to understand how developers first entered the open source world, what challenges they faced, and what helped them stay.
👉 Take the 3-minute anonymous survey here

Google Forms
This survey is for anyone who has ever tried contributing to open source — whether you’re a regular contributor, a beginner, or someone who attempted it once.
I'm currently conducting research for a publication that explores how structured mentorship can help improve onboarding and retention in open source communities. Your input will help:
The results will be summarized in a public post, and may be used to inform future academic or community research efforts.

If you've been part of OSS in any way — or tried to be — I’d love your input.

And if you know someone who might have something to say, feel free to share 💙

Farcaster seeks to connect users while balancing trust with scale.
It follows a mixed, on-chain/off-chain logic:
On-chain registry: creates accounts and keeps track of identities, permissions, and pointers.
Off-chain hubs: verifies, stores, syncs, and shares data (e.g. posts, follows).
User-facing clients: signs messages on behalf of the user and sends them to hubs.
NOTE: Farcaster has just moved its data layer from hubs to Snapchain.

The source of the data could be anything - your email inbox, a large text file on your machine or a webpage on the internet. It's not perfect, but it can give you a head start on large tasks that involve a lot of data. One of the things I get asked about a lot by developers is how they can use AI to analyze video content. Multimodal LLMs have come a long way, but they're not quite at the point where they could ingest an hour's worth of video from a live stream and provide a summary or identify potential clips for sharing on social media. But there's another approach that we can take to solve this problem.
