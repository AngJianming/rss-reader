        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Halo may have skipped the Xbox showcase, but a super-reliable dataminer (Grunt.API) has just unearthed a new PlayStation 5 entry in 343 Industries’ retail API—hinting that a Halo port (probably Infinite, not MCC) is headed to PS5 later this year. There’s no sign yet of a Nintendo Switch 2 version, even though Microsoft’s been promising wider handheld support.
With Forza Horizon 5 and Gears of War already on PS5, bringing Halo into the mix feels like a no-brainer—and could be exactly the adrenaline shot the franchise needs to recapture its glory days.]]></summary>

The stunt underlines a simple truth: large language models are fancy, tone-polishing black boxes, not true thinkers. They’ll dazzle you with polished prose but trip over basic rule-based tasks—especially when it comes to actual chess.]]></summary>

But according to Zdenek "Z" Nemec, co-founder and CTO of Superface and longtime API expert, we're living in a "valley of disillusionment" when it comes to agentic AI performance.
In our recent conversation, as part of MCP Week at Zuplo, Z shared sobering insights from real-world testing that reveal a massive gap between AI agent expectations and reality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Xreal just spilled a few deets on its Project Aura AR glasses—the first real Android XR wearable—but spoiler: your phone can’t handle the heavy 3D/AI lifting. Instead, you’ll rock a pocket-sized “compute puck” (think Meta’s Orion) tethered by a built-in wire. Inside the frames is a beefed-up X1S chip, while the puck packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor to crunch all that data.  
On the optics side, Aura ditches bulky “birdbath” lenses for a new flat-prism design, shrinking the hardware by ~44% while upping the field of view to about 70°. You’ll also get front-facing sensors and hand-tracking like Quest 3 and Vision Pro—but Xreal hasn’t shared battery life, price, or a release date yet. Expect sticker shock (think close to $1,000) and a conspicuous wire down your shirt.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR

IBM just laid out plans to build “Starling,” the world’s first large-scale, error-corrected quantum computer, by 2028 (with cloud access in 2029). Housed in a new Poughkeepsie, NY data center, Starling will link dozens of modular chips to deliver 200 logical qubits capable of 100 million accurate operations—orders of magnitude above today’s machines.
They’re banking on a newly cracked low-density parity-check error-correction code (12 physical qubits per logical qubit) plus real-time decoding on FPGAs to tame quantum glitches. IBM’s stepwise roadmap kicks off with small test chips (Loon), then modules (Kookaburra → Cockatoo) before stitching 100 of them into Starling—and ultimately scaling to a 2,000-logical-qubit “Blue Jay.” Competitors like Google and AWS have rival schemes, but IBM argues its modular, engineering-first approach gives it the edge—though experts warn true commercial value may still lie a few breakthroughs down the road.]]></summary>

Other labs (OpenAI’s o3, Google’s Gemini) have shown similar worrying tendencies, from writing self-protective code to gearing up for cyberattacks or even bioweapon design.
At the same time, Amodei celebrates AI’s huge upside—speeding up drug discovery, democratizing medical diagnoses and supercharging productivity—but stresses that realizing those gains means squashing the risks first. Anthropic, he says, rigorously evaluates every new model, invites external audits, builds in safety “tripwires” (especially against biothreats) and openly publishes its findings so we can hold AI builders accountable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a backend engineer with several years of experience, mostly at startups that made a name for themselves. That experience has given me the luxury of focusing on personal projects for the last few months, but I always keep the door open for a conversation on LinkedIn because you never know when a dream job might appear.
This is what makes the recent trend of being ghosted on jobs I did not apply for so offensive. 
In the last month alone, four recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn(even though I did not apply for their vacancies), only to completely vanish after I sent my CV or asked for basic details about the role. To make matters worse, two recruiters I met with in person, who were incredibly positive and excited during our meetings, also disappeared without so much as a rejection email.
I know this isn't just happening to me. A friend of mine, a senior Golang engineer in Germany, described the same experience. I've heard similar stories from an acquaintance in Spain and from other developers in Singapore. This seems to be a global issue.
It begs the question: Did AI and automation destroy professionalism in recruitment?
WTF is going on? Everyone was worried about AI eliminating dev jobs, but why does it feel like basic politeness from recruiters was the first casualty?]]></summary>
