After months of reviewing AI-generated code, I've noticed the same security holes appear over and over. Here are the patterns that keep showing up, and how to catch them before they become problems.
What AI does:
// AI loves writing this
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
const { name, email, age } = req.body;
const user = new User({ name, email, age });
user.save();
});

The problem: No validation whatsoever. AI treats user input like trusted data.
What you'll actually get:
Empty strings breaking your database
Malicious scripts in name fields
Negative ages and impossible dates
Emails like "definitely-not-an-email"

Somethings which would be as easy as hello world in some other language or runtime - it would be near impossible to implement in node js espically due to it's single threaded nature. Go on the other hand comes with built in support for multithreading.
I had been tackling an issue where I needed to synchronize my database with a CRM database which had strict limit on how many API requests I could make per 5 secs. I tried everything from shifting framework (Node to Nest), tried using event driven architecture with REDIS as transport, and tried using BullMQ. But nothing worked; I needed my application to run 24/7 and keep data in sync - node just couldn't do it. It lacks alot in this domain due to it's internal acrhecture. 

Go on other hand had shined here - it came with built in support for background jobs running on multiple threads. I could make 100s to 1000s of background jobs using go routines on same machine where I could barely run 3 or 4 in node js. Go allowed me to run the application 24/7 without any downtime - yes I mean any. Not once was heap memory full or some other internal issue. 
But even go had it's downside. Not a lot of community support espically in niched areas. I had to build a lot of stuff which is easy to implement in node js by installing third party libraries. 
if anyone has worked or is working on API polling database's, or similar task - I would love to connect with you]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Learning a programming language is most effective when paired with hands-on projects, as real-world challenges accelerate mastery. With a background in C# and active contributions to the Brighter framework, I decided to build a project called Ming to deepen my Elixir skills. This project explores Elixir’s functional programming paradigm while implementing patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
Ming draws inspiration from the Brighter framework and Commanded. Its core focus is to replicate and adapt CQRS principles from C# to Elixir’s.
Maybe you are asking yourself why Ming and if there is any meaning, I was looking a library name that was short easy to pronounce in English and it should be close the Brighter, I couldn't find any good name in Portugues…]]></summary>
