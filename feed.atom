        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin miner Riot Platforms has reported its highest-ever quarterly revenue, but still posted a loss as mining costs have nearly doubled compared to the same time last year and it moves to bolster its facilities.
“We achieved a new record for quarterly revenue this quarter, at $161.4 million,” Riot CEO Jason Les said in a May 1 report for its first quarter 2025 earnings. The company just surpassed Wall Street estimates of $159.79 million by 1%.
Riot’s Q1 revenue was a 50% jump compared to the same quarter a year ago.
Riot blames “halving event” for expenses
The firm reported a net loss of $296,367 over Q1, a 240% decrease from the $211,777 net income it posted in the year-ago quarter.
Riot said that the average cost to mine Bitcoin (BTC) over the quarter was $43,808, almost 90% more than …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of machine learning, hyperparameter optimisation remains a critical factor in determining model performance. While traditional methods like grid search or random search still serve a purpose, genetic algorithms (GAs) have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for navigating complex hyperparameter spaces, especially in 2025’s evolving AI landscape.
Inspired by natural selection, genetic algorithms are a class of optimisation techniques based on principles of evolution, such as selection, crossover, and mutation. In machine learning, they are beneficial for optimising non-differentiable, high-dimensional, and irregular objective functions like hyperparameter sets.
Unlike brute-force approaches, GAs search intelligently, making them well-suited for fine-tuning models with…]]></summary>

my name is tim and I'm not what you would call a developer, coder or designer. I'm simply a guy who has always wanted to build websites, get involved in software and has a general passion for all things tech, computer and video games. not a very exciting bio, but over the years I've owned and shutdown dozens of domains, having failed to ever gain traction or even code them properly and the last few years i sort of lost all hope. and then chatgpt came along and i figured what do i have to lose, it can't be anything worse than what I've done before!
and with that, i ran the idea of a site i always wanted to have to chatgpt and 30 seconds later it spat back a whole design skeleton, coding, file structure and naming and where to host it! i was immediately hooked and after a few days of collaboration, trial and error i am beyond thrilled to have a fully functioning news aggregate site! a fancy RSS feed collector if you will as I'm always reading the latest news from around the world and wanted an easier way to get it in one place.
and so, i submit to the community my site inertality.com
I'm excited to keep working with python and regained my love for HTML and that is my opening post! :)]]></summary>

That’s where the RACI matrix comes in. It’s a simple, powerful way to map out who’s responsible for what, who needs to be consulted, and who needs to stay in the loop. In this post, we’ll break down how RACI works for developers, why it matters, and how you can use it (with tools like Teamcamp) to keep your team aligned and productive.

The RACI matrix is a tool for assigning roles and responsibilities on a project. Each letter stands for a different role:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed to drop another of its crypto lawsuits, this time its unregistered securities sales case against crypto influencer and YouTuber Ian Balina. 
The SEC said in a May 1 joint stipulation with Balina to an Austin federal court that it “believes the dismissal of this case is appropriate,” citing the work of the agency’s Crypto Task Force.
The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.
“Obviously, the new administration is pro-crypto,” Balin…]]></summary>

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

Despite weak US manufacturing data, Federal Reserve liquidity plans and strong corporate earnings keep equities and crypto afloat.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

Gaming is "part of our DNA," the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry.

US wants to cut off Huione over crypto crime
The US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) on May 1 proposed blocking the Cambodia-based Huione Group from the US banking system, accusing it of helping North Korea’s state-backed Lazarus Group to launder crypto.
Huione Group comprises a network of businesses, which includes payment service platform Huione Pay PLC, the crypto exchange Huione Crypto, and Haowang Guarantee, an online marketplace offering illicit goods and services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Avraham Eisenberg was sentenced to more than four years in prison on child sexual abuse material charges, unrelated to his role in the 2022 exploit that drained the decentralized exchange Mango Markets of roughly $100 million.
According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge. In May 2024, the judge suggested the sentencing for both cases would occur simultaneously in a consolidated proceeding. However, as of May 1, the fraud sentencing remains …]]></summary>

Michael Saylor's Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has reported earning a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings as it missed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates.
The company said in its May 1 earnings statement that its year-to-date Bitcoin (BTC) yield equates to a gain of more than 61,000 BTC, worth approximately $5.8 billion. Bitcoin yield and gain are unofficial accounting metrics Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buys. 
Strategy’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said it would increase its Bitcoin yield target for this year to 25% and its Bitcoin gain target to $15 billion.

In a May 1 letter to Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) — the entity responsible for managing the US government’s properties — Rep. Lance Gooden claimed that introducing crypto ATMs to federal buildings would serve as an “educational resource” and reflect advances in financial technology. He requested that the GSA begin exploring the necessary guidelines and regulations needed to install such ATMs in government-controlled properties across the US, citing alignment with President Donald Trump’s goals.

Bitcoin (BTC) is evolving into an alternative reserve currency, propelling institutional demand and potentially pricing out retail investors, Kunz said during Cointelegraph's LONGITUDE event in Dubai. 
"Every retail user should be thinking about getting at least one Bitcoin — very soon they won’t be able to afford it,” Kunz said. 
If the United States starts buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency, he added. "I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting.

The decision was shared in a May 1 X post, with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement:
"Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur."

"General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance."

Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major European cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares has filed for a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, marking another step in its expansion to the US market.
21Shares on April 30 submitted the Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui (SUI) ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares’ US subsidiary.
The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam.

The 128-page filing does not specify on which US exchange the new SUI ETF is exp…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>
