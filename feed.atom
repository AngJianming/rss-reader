        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Everyone’s talking about Supabase, Vercel, Firebase, Replit, and similar services as the go-to stack to launch SaaS apps fast.
I tried them.
They’re sleek and easy to use. But once I started estimating real-world costs for my project, I realized they add up fast, and that’s a problem when you're launching without real users yet.
So I built my SaaS, Odichat, with a different approach — one that costs me $45/month and gives me full control, solid performance, and zero vendor lock-in.
Let me break it down.
Here’s what I’m running:
A production-ready Rails 8 app
A staging environment for safe deployments
File storage for user uploads
Transactional emails
Background job processing
Websockets
Caching
And all of this for $45/month.
Here’s the exact monthly breakdown:
Hetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49
Hetzner shared vCPU (remote builder): $4.99
(used for asset precompilation and deploys)
Hetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99
DigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33
Zoho Mail (support email inbox): $1
Postmark (transactional emails): $15
Total: $45.80 USD/month
I’m using SQLite3 as the database.
Yep, SQLite in production.
It’s free, and for my current load it works perfectly. I haven’t had a single issue that justifies migrating to PostgreSQL (yet).
Rails 8 ships with the “Solid” suite:
Solid Queue (background jobs)
Solid Cache
Solid Cable (Websockets)
It’s a full-featured solution without extra setup or Redis requirements. And it performs great.
Because I want:
Predictable, low costs
Zero surprises from usage-based pricing
Infra I understand and can control
The ability to grow into higher traffic without switching stacks
I’m not anti-serverless. But at this stage, this is the simplest and most sustainable setup I’ve found.
It’s not “trendy”.
It’s not “modern”.
But it works AMAZINGLY well, it’s cheap, and it lets me focus on building, not budgeting.
If you’re building a SaaS and want full control without overpaying early on, I highly recommend exploring this kind of setup — especially if you’re using Rails.]]></summary>

You feel genuine love for it before you could simmer down to what it is that makes you so invested in that obsession. For me, it was poetry and coding. Pretty odd, innit? How can something that is mainly so technical and rigid merge with something so fluid and almost unpredictable?
The difference is that_ both of them are playing with rules and regulations_ instead of confiding in it. Poetry mutates grammar to bleed; coding forces syntax to *_inovate`
Back when I was learning coding, I would play around with the given rules, adding and deducting, making and breaking to create new efficient codes. When I started writing poetry, I would play with my …]]></summary>

Alright, let's kick things off with the heavyweights. OpenAI and Anthropic, the multi-billion dollar giants, are throwing serious manpower and cash at these coding assistants.

It doesn't require extracting i18n keys, or wrapping text in  tags.
100% free and open-source.
Here's how it works:




The core challenge: How do you translate React components without touching the source code?
Traditional i18n requires rewriting your entire codebase - extracting strings to JSON files, wrapping components in translation tags, maintaining separate dictionaries.
We asked ourselves: "What if that actually wasn't necessary?"
So, we came up with this idea to processes React app's Abstract Syntax Tree and perform localization at build time.
But here's the tricky part: we had to solve how to deterministically group elements that should be …]]></summary>

Not a game, but I did some “coding”! I mean, I’m not sure anymore as I haven’t written a single line of code, but I did release a shader - check out Vibe coding js13kGames shader for the V Shaders challenge blog post. It’s not much, but it’s js13kGames-branded, animates nicely, don’t throw any errors in the console, and looks good enough. Vibe coded it super fast with ChatGPT.

Am I back to coding if I didn’t write the code? Who knows, but at least I’m closer to building and releasing some games again. It’s high time as the last Enclave Games creation was Forest Cuties - in June… 2021.
I’ve focused on writing about the Gamedev.js Jam 2025 this month:
[10.05] Gamedev.js: Gamedev.js Jam 2025 winners announced!

[11.05] Gamedev.js: Best entries from the Challenges in Gamedev.js Jam 2025

[20.05] Gamedev.js: New Gamedev.js Jam 2025 t-shirt: Balance!

[21.05] Enclave Games: Vibe coding js13kGames shader for the V Shaders challenge




I’m still quite happy about the shader though.
Winners of the $NOODS challenge in Gamedev.js Jam 2025 were announced, among other challenges.

I’m exploring vibe coding web games, since PotNoodleDev is OP Games ’ AI agent who does exactly that.
Michelle “MishManners” Duke and Dobuki Gamer streamed playing Gamedev.js Jam 2025 entries on YouTube - you should definitely check those out, and if you recorded something yourself please let us know.

Landing page of Gamedev.js Jam 2026 is already up, along with the relevant Itch page.
NeuroshimaHex.pl is the official patron of the 20th anniversary edition of Neuroshima Hex in Poland that is planned to be released in September, our logo will land at the back of the box.
Start the preparations to js13kGames 2025, hopefully with the website’s sources on GitHub.
Vibe code some games, hopefully.]]></summary>

Business logic should only ignore errors when necessary; otherwise, errors should not be ignored.
In theory, this design makes programmers consciously handle every error, resulting in more robust programs.
In this article, let's talk about best practices for handling errors properly.
Only ignore errors when business logic requires it; otherwise, handle every error.
Use the errors package to wrap errors for stack information, print error details more precisely, and use trace_id in distributed systems to link errors from the same request.
Errors should only be handled once, including logging or implementing fallback mechanisms.

Exporting in Perl is a mechanism that allows you to make functions or variables available to the user of a module without requiring them to fully qualify the names. This is typically done using the 'Exporter' module, which provides a simple way to export symbols from a module, however there are many other variants of exporters on cpan.

I recently I did something kind of insane:
I created my own scripting language called W++ — it has Python-style syntax, runs on .NET, supports entities, async, lambdas, and more...
But I didn’t stop there.
I decided to make it run in the browser. No HTML. No JS. No boilerplate. Just raw WebAssembly.
OOPSIEWASM is an experimental playground that lets you:
✅ Write W++ code directly in the browser

✅ Use externcall() to draw on a <canvas>

✅ Run it all via Blazor WebAssembly, no JS required

✅ Dream of a world with no HTML in DevTools
It’s real. It’s working. And it's probably the most chaotic thing I've ever built.
externcall("canvas", "drawText", "Hello from W++", 10, 50);

That line draws on a real HTML5 canvas — from W++, running in WASM.
🎮 Live playground & video:
https://github.com/sinisterMage/WPlusPlusPlayground/blob/main/Recording%202025-06-03%20205424.mp4 
https://github.com/sinisterMage/WPlusPlusPlayground
Written in C#
JIT and interpreted backends
Uses System.Reflection.Emit
Renders to  via C# → JS interop
Entire frontend: Blazor WebAssembly
Because I wanted to make something wild. Something alive in the browser.
Something that says:
“You don’t need to be older, funded, or famous to build something original.”
Just a laptop, an idea, and obsession.
Would love your thoughts, questions, even critiques —
