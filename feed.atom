Keeping your SQL Server databases running at peak performance requires regular index maintenance. One critical but often overlooked aspect is how parallelism, controlled through the MAXDOP setting, can significantly impact the speed and efficiency of index rebuilds. In this guide, we'll walk through how you can optimize your SQL Server index maintenance by properly configuring MAXDOP.

Index fragmentation is an inevitable side effect of everyday database operations like inserts, updates, and deletes. Over time, fragmented indexes can lead to slower queries and increased I/O, affecting the overall performance of your applications.
Performing regular index maintenance — through rebuilds or reorganizations — is essential to…]]></summary>

The game includes three skills, rare pets to obtain along the way while skilling, an inventory to hold the players items, a bank to transfer items to and from the players inventory, the ability for the player to equip and unequip items as well as a collection log to track the players item progressions.

Imagine um mundo onde fazer check-in no trabalho, na escola ou em um evento é tão simples quanto olhar para uma câmera — sem cartões, sem papelada, sem complicações. No entanto, inúmeras organizações ainda dependem de métodos ultrapassados de controle de presença que consomem tempo, geram erros e frustram os usuários. Folhas de assinatura manuais, relógios de ponto e cartões RFID podem ter sido eficazes no passado, mas no cenário atual, dinâmico e impulsionado pela tecnologia, eles já não atendem às necessidades. Esses sistemas não são apenas lentos e difíceis de usar, mas também estão sujeitos a fraudes, como o "ponto amigo", em que uma pessoa registra a entrada por outra.

Welcome to the world of prompt engineering—where asking the right question can make all the difference between brilliance and bafflement.
At its core, prompt engineering is the art of communicating effectively with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. In earlier AI systems, communication meant writing code. Now, it's natural language text.
A prompt is simply a structured input to the model—just like asking a well-worded question. The way you phrase that input heavily influences the output.
A good prompt is like good code: clear, purposeful, and context-aware.

In this article, we will explore the best practices for using semaphores and locks in C# concurrency, particularly in scenarios involving cooks and customers.

Understanding the Problem Scenario
You have created a system where customers place orders, and cooks prepare these orders. After preparing a specified number of portions, the last cook will deliver the tray for customer pickup. This concurrency model implies multiple threads accessing shared resources. In your context, managing these threads properly is crucial, as failures to do so can lead to data corruption or inconsistent …]]></summary>

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>

“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

Democrats aim at Trump’s crypto profits with a 3-prong pincer move
US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.
