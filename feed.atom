Async-Profiler is a low-overhead sampling profiler for Java applications running on the HotSpot JVM. For the Angular frontend, you’ll primarily rely on browser developer tools and potentially some Angular-specific profiling techniques. Container startup performance presents a significant challenge for Java-angular applications running on Kubernetes, particularly during scaling events and recovery scenarios.

bad Developer Experience feels like.
Think of DevEx—short for Developer Experience—as the user experience for developers.
The speed of CI/CD pipelines
The clarity of your internal docs
The quality of your API responses
How friendly your error messages are
The way your tools support (or frustrate) your flow
And here’s the kicker.
You can build it like a product.

Let’s be honest.
A complex codebase
A barely working staging server
Outdated Confluence pages
Random Slack threads with tribal knowledge

No. Not good.

Dodging the Null Pointer Exception, the Kotlin way🤓🤓

➤ Concept of Strict Null Safety in Kotlin
• Safe Call Operator ( ?. ) in Kotlin
( ?: ) in Kotlin
( !! ) in Kotlin.

Kotlin allows to store “Null” values in a variable.
In Kotlin, the variables can be made of Null types by just adding a “?” symbol to the right side of the data type.
A nullable type variable means it can also hold “Null” as a value in it.
A non-nullable type variable means that it can not hold “Null” as a value in it.

The safe call operator is simply a question mark followed by a dot ( ?. )

The safe call operator in Kotlin, is one of the methods to impose “Null Safety Checks” on the nullable variables.
If the left-hand side of the operator is null, then it will return null value.
If the left-hand side of the operator is not null, then it will return the result of the right-hand side expression.

The elvis operator is represented by a question mark followed by a colon ( ?: )

The elvis operator in Kotlin, is one of the methods to impose “Null Safety Checks” on the nullable variables.
If the first operand is not null, then this operand will be returned by the elvis operator.
If the first operand is null, then second operand will be returned by the elvis operator.

The Not Null Assertion is represented by a double exclamation mark (!!)

The Not Null Assertion in Kotlin, is another tool to deal with nullity.
This operator explicitly casts nullable variables to non-nullable variables.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["The main motivation, the original motivation for (creating) Lean was in software verification, right? I mean, Z3 was very popular at bug finding, for bug finding at Microsoft, was very influential there. But (for) Lean the goal was, can we make the same, have the same success of software verification? 
We went to a very strange path. I mean, having impact in mathematics that we never dreamt of. 
But the goal in both cases is like we, both in software mathematics and in AI, today rely on manual review, partial testing. A mistake in a theorem can be catastrophic, invalidating the whole result. The same thing (happens) for a critical piece of software, right? And one thing I see all the time, people fearing to make a change a piece of software because they fear by making the change they may be introducing a bug, especially if it's a critical piece of software."

Some, such as Amplitude and Mixpanel, require you to send your data to their proprietary systems, which can create data silos and increase the need for manual integration. In contrast, warehouse-native solutions like NetSpring (Optimizely Analytics) and Mitzu connect directly to your cloud data warehouse. This approach lets you analyze all customer and sales data in one centralized location, eliminating the need for data transfers. As your business grows, warehouse-native tools provide greater flexibility, real-time analytics, and improved data consistency.

Synchronous vs. asynchronous replication
How to handle node failures
Problems with replication lag
Setting up new replicas
Replication = Keeping copies of the same data on multiple machines
Three key reasons:
Latency: Keep data geographically close to users


Let's say you're in China. Your app will use a nearby database server, ideally also in China. This is much faster than using one in the US for example.
Availability: Keep the system running even when some parts fail


What if a DB server goes down? We will just connect to other, more to this later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.
Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

In an interview at Consensus 2025, the executive said that Pyth Network's data pull model sets it apart from traditional pricing oracles, allowing customers to pay for data on demand, reducing costs for institutions reliant on real-time market data.

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.
Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.
