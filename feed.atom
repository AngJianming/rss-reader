Using kubeconfig, kubectl first authenticates with the API server.

If you're encountering the error "no suitable HttpMessageConverter found" while using RestTemplate.postForEntity() with a multipart file and a JSON object, you’re not alone! This error often disrupts the successful execution of HTTP requests, especially when the request includes mixed content types. Let’s delve into the reasons behind this error and explore a practical solution to successfully send your request.
Understanding the Error
The HttpMessageConverter is responsible for converting HTTP requests and responses to and from Java objects. The error you're seeing typically occurs because Spring cannot find a suitable converter to handle the combination of multipart data and JSON. This can happen for several reasons, including:

Whether you're powering a single-page app or delivering data to mobile clients, a robust backend API is essential. FastAPI has rapidly become the go-to solution for Python developers needing high-performance, scalable APIs with minimal setup.
In this guide, we’ll cover how to build and test a blazing-fast REST API using FastAPI, and how to connect it to a frontend with fetch/AJAX.
FastAPI is a modern, async-first Python web framework designed specifically for building APIs. Here’s why developers love it:
Asynchronous by default: Supports async/await natively.
Type hints = auto validation: Uses Python type hints to auto-generate docs and validate input.
Interactive API docs: Comes with Swagger and Redoc interfaces out of the box.

Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has just snagged the crown as the highest-rated original IP on the PlayStation Store, overtaking Omori with a stellar 4.92 average from over 11,000 reviews. The current top ten also features indie hits like Vampire Survivors (4.88) and Split Fiction (4.88), classics such as Persona 5 (4.87) and Hades (4.86), plus fan-faves like Astro Bot (4.84).
Critics are equally smitten—Metacritic sits it at a solid 92—and it’s already shifted 1 million copies. Even French President Emmanuel Macron chimed in, cheering on developer Sandfall Interactive for packing “boldness and creativity in French.”]]></summary>

It’s a deceptively simple question — but one that often separates secure, maintainable apps from brittle, exploitable ones.
In practice, this decision is less about choosing where to handle things and more about being intentional about what needs to be done — and why. Let’s break it down together: when to sanitize, when to escape, and how to divide responsibilities between the frontend and backend.
Not all user input is created equal. Some values are meant to be raw text (like usernames), while others might intentionally include HTML (like blog posts). How we handle each type depends heavily on context:
Should the input ever be rendered as HTML?
Will the input be stored and reused later?

The gameplay trailer teases a more linear, story-driven adventure—complete with vintage cars, horseback gunslinging and even high-stakes knife fights—as it explores the Mafia’s outlaw origins far from the polished power plays we’ve seen before.
After the mixed reception of Mafia III, this fresh take leans into a raw, dynamic tone, promising to stand on its own alongside inevitable Red Dead comparisons. If you’re craving classic shoot-’em-up action with a new-old twist, The Old Country might just ride into your must-play list.]]></summary>

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.

In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.
While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. 
At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. 
Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation an…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has added another $129 million to its Bitcoin treasury, pushing its total holdings past the Bitcoin-stacking country of El Salvador. 
“Metaplanet now holds more Bitcoin than El Salvador. From humble beginnings to rivaling nation-states, we’re just getting started,” said CEO Simon Gerovich on X after the latest purchase announcement. 
On May 12, the Tokyo-listed firm announced that it had acquired 1,241 Bitcoin (BTC) for 14.8 million yen ($101,843) per coin.
The total buy, at its highest ever purchase price, is worth around $129 million at current market prices. 
This brings the firm’s total holdings to 6,796 Bitcoin, currently worth around $707 million, and the average purchase price is $91,000 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet started its BTC accumulation strateg…]]></summary>

On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios' April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”

“The issue was quickly contained: the compromised account was removed, the bot was deleted, the website was reported, and all relevant permissions were reviewed and secured.”

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

Bitcoin analysis identifies the all-important price point to hold into the weekly close as all-time highs loom.


Liquidity is tightly clustered around current spot price, with $106,000 the likely next battleground.

Some traders are expecting the bid to enter price discovery to fail.

Bitcoin (BTC) preserved giant gains into the May 11 weekly close as analysis flagged the key level to hold next.

Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.
Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”
