        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[1. Joining the Twilio Sandbox


Before you can start receiving messages via Webhook, you need to join the WhatsApp Sandbox.
Here's how:
In your Twilio Console, navigate to Messaging > Try it Out > Send a WhatsApp message.

You’ll see a Sandbox section.
Send the provided code (something like "join magic-pizza") to the given WhatsApp number.
In my case, it was "join control-type".
✅ Done! Your phone is now linked to the Sandbox.

Important:
Next, you’ll tell Twilio where to send incoming messages.
In the Sandbox settings, set your Webhook URL for incoming messages (e.g., https://yourdomain.com/webhook).

You can do this on the same page, under the "Sandbox Settings" tab.

Make sure your server can accept POST requests from Twilio.
Now, every time that phone number receives a WhatsApp message, Twilio will send the message to your webhook so you can handle the incoming message.
Twilio will send a payload like this:
{
    "SmsMessageSid": "SMc8df133659ef2ca4251da5b1ac5453cdg",
    "NumMedia": "0",
    "ProfileName": "John Smith",
    "MessageType": "text",
    "SmsSid": "SMc8df133659ef2ca4251da5b1ac5453cdg",
    "WaId": "+157822787582693",
    "SmsStatus": "received",
    "Body": "The body of the message that you are receiving",
    "To": "whatsapp:+157822787584443",
    "NumSegments": "1",
    "ReferralNumMedia": "0",
    "MessageSid": "SMc8df133659ef2ca4251da5b1ac5453cdg",
    "AccountSid": "youraccountId",
    "From": "whatsapp:+157822787582693",
    "ApiVersion": "2010-04-01"
}

We'll code a real webhook handler in the next part 😉]]></summary>

One of the most effective tools for this is the C4 Model — a simple yet powerful way to document and visualize software architecture.
Created by Simon Brown, the C4 model offers a hierarchical approach to diagramming, allowing you to gradually zoom in from broad concepts to detailed implementation. The model consists of four levels:
System Context
Containers

What makes it especially convenient is that C4 is often used together with PlantUML, a powerful text-based tool for creating UML diagrams. This allows you to describe your system structu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've all done this:
const payload = {
  action_type: event.actionType,
};

if (event.contextLabel) {
  payload.label = event.contextLabel;
}

Or:
const payload = Object.assign(
  {
    action_type: event.actionType,
  },
  event.contextLabel ? { label: event.contextLabel } : {}
);

But there's a better way, more concise, safe, and expressive:
const payload = {
  action_type: event.actionType,
  ...(event.contextLabel && { label: event.contextLabel }),
};

The && operator short-circuits. If contextLabel is falsy, nothing gets spread.
If it's truthy, { label: value } is merged into the object.
No mutations, no conditionals. Just structure.
Make sure contextLabel is optional in your type definition:
type UserActionEvent = {
  actionType: string;
  contextLabel?: string;
};

When constructing payloads for analytics, logging, or API calls.
When working with dynamic form data.
When building clean utility functions.
Clean code is not about writing less, it’s about making the intent obvious. This pattern removes clutter while keeping flexibility.
Try it in your next project and let your code breathe.]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…]]></summary>

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.
“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christopher Giancarlo, former chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has joined Sygnum in an advisory role, where he will help the crypto bank navigate global regulations amid growing institutional interest in digital assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.
“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Instagram account of former US rap trio Migos was hacked in an apparent attempt to blackmail Solana co-founder Raj Gokal.
On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph that have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, says institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that could pose security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.
