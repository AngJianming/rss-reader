The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that both delays were expected as the SEC “typically take…]]></summary>

There’s a Marathi phrase that haunts me:
“आरंभी शूर” — brave only at the beginning.
That’s been me.
Every few weeks, I would ignite a new initiative.
And then…
The energy would dip.
I wasn't lazy. I was just undisciplined.

Why I Started Strong


Because beginnings are easy.
Starting made me feel in control.
So I jumped to the next thing, chasing clarity where none existed.
What It Cost Me



A backlog of 80% complete initiatives
Loss of credibility with my own team
Technical debt disguised as momentum
Incomplete loops in validation, delivery, and feedback
And most painfully — a reputation for “getting things started”
But never enough for “getting things done.”
Code, Culture, and Closure


I prided myself on innovation. But what I needed was consistency.
closure.
Code went unchecked.
This isn’t just a workflow issue.

What I’m Doing Now


I’ve decided to break this cycle.
No new initiatives until old ones are closed.
No task is “done” until validated, tested, and documented.
No PR is merged unless reviewed — fully, fearlessly.
Daily logs, closure reports, and personal audits.
Not for the team. For me. To remind myself:
Shipping > Starting. Always.
This post is not a motivational speech.
I am the bottleneck.
No more आरंभी शूर.
Finish what I start.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When an API is loading slowly, there could be multiple reasons behind it. Here’s a breakdown of common causes and what they mean:
⚙️ 1. Client-Side Issues
🐢 Slow internet connection (e.g., poor mobile data or Wi-Fi)
🕰️ Blocking synchronous code on the frontend, like large loops or animations that freeze UI
📦 Rendering too much data at once (e.g., a huge React table without pagination or virtualization)
❌ No loading indicators, which can make users feel the app is slower even if it isn’t
🌐 2. Network Issues
High latency due to physical distance between client and server
Network congestion or packet loss slowing requests
Firewall or proxy issues blocking or delaying requests
🖥️ 3. Server-Side Issues
Server overloaded and can’t handle many concurrent requests
Synchronous/blocking operations in business logic causing delays
Database slow queries or locks slowing down responses
Not using asynchronous processing where appropriate
📈 4. Design and Architectural Factors
API not designed for scalability or optimized for quick responses
Missing or inefficient caching mechanisms
Too many unnecessary data payloads increasing transfer size
📡 5. External Factors
Third-party services or APIs called inside your API causing delays
Geographic location mismatch causing longer data travel times

But not all segmentation is created equal. There are four primary types, each serving a distinct purpose and offering increasing levels of detail and understanding.
At its most fundamental level, Image Segmentation divides an image into logical groups of pixels based on criteria like color, texture, or intensity. Think of it as drawing boundaries around areas with shared characteristics.
Groups pixels into regions (e.g., "this blob is a tree").
Outputs contours (outlines) or masks (filled areas).
Uses pseudo-coloring to differentiate segments visually.

If you're working with PHP, understanding how try-catch blocks work and how to handle exceptions correctly is essential for writing robust and maintainable code.
Exception handling is the process of managing errors or unexpected behavior in a program. In PHP, this is typically done using the try-catch construct. The try block contains code that might throw an exception, while the catch block handles the exception. With the latest updates in PHP 8, this process has become more streamlined and developer-friendly.
One of the key improvements in PHP 8 is its support for multi-catch blocks. This means you can now catch multiple exception types in a single catch cla…]]></summary>

“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”

In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.
According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to annou…]]></summary>

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.

Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[India’s Supreme Court questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.
According to the Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the increasing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, which remain largely unregulated.
“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.
“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binance has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX estate, accusing the defunct crypto exchange of trying to deflect blame for its own failure.
Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.
Binance rejects this claim, stating that “…]]></summary>

According to a May 20 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Maelstrom will finance Allen’s work on his Payjoin devkit alongside Dan Gould. The system allows Bitcoin (BTC) senders and receivers to use batched transactions, with positive implications for scalability and privacy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.
“Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post, adding:
