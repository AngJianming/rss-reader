But after reading about WhiteBIT’s massive live crypto trading showdown, I found myself stepping back and thinking: people really underestimate the complexity of running something like this.
From a technical standpoint, a real-time trading tournament isn’t just “a feature.” It’s a beast.
Here’s why.
This wasn’t your average leaderboard. This was a live-streamed, time-limited, high-stakes trading competition, where the platform had to:
Process thousands of trades per second
Ensure fair execution with no latency or slippage
Update scores in real-time for a global audience
Prevent manipulation or bot-driven exploits
Deliver all of this seamlessly — whi…]]></summary>

Whether you're organizing a list of names, numbers, or custom objects, understanding how Java handles comparisons is essential. At the heart of this functionality lies the powerful compareTo() method, a feature every Java developer should master. In this guide, we'll explore the depths of compareTo Java, covering its purpose, behavior, and best practices — all while integrating core concepts like Java String format to improve clarity and readability.

The compareTo() method is part of the Comparable interface in Java. Its primary function is to define the natural ordering of objects. When a class implements Comparable, it must override the compareTo() method to determine how its instances should be comp…]]></summary>

From quirky innovators to ruthless traders, from idealists building DAOs to entrepreneurs buying private islands, crypto’s wealthiest don’t exactly follow a single mold.
And that’s exactly what makes this space so fascinating.
The article profiles figures like Changpeng Zhao (CZ), Sam Bankman-Fried, and Vitalik Buterin — each of whom represents a very different crypto philosophy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my recent 𝗘𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 project, I implemented the 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 as part of the 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗔𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 approach — and it transformed the way I structured my application logic.
🧩 What is a Use Case in Clean Architecture?
A 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲 represents a 𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗼𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 from the user's perspective, such as:
CreateReview, SubmitReview, UpdateReview,  DeleteReview



It fits into the 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿, where it:
IReviewRepository
🛠️ Example: Using Repository in Use Case
public class CreateReviewUseCase
public CreateReviewUseCase(IReviewRepository reviewRepository)
{
    _reviewRepository = reviewRepository;
}

public async Task ExecuteAsync(CreateReviewDto dto)
{
    var review = new EmployeeReview(dto.EmployeeId, ReviewScore.Create(dto.Score), dto.Comments);
    await _reviewRepository.AddAsync(review);
}

}

This use case calls the repository but knows nothing about the actual database.
🧠 How We Use It in the Controllers:
In your Controllers or API Endpoints, you can simply call the use case:
public async Task CreateReview(CreateReviewDto model)
This separation keeps controllers 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻, and ensures 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰 𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗲.
If you're aiming to build 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗰𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, try applying 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 in the 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿 — it makes your business rules easier to manage and evolve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Look, we all know the drill. Rejections sting. Especially when you've poured your heart and soul into something, whether it's landing that dream dev gig or chasing any other passion. And for those of us in the tech world, let's be real, it can feel like a constant barrage sometimes. From the very beginning of this journey, years ago for me, it's been a rollercoaster of "yeses" and a whole lot of "not quite."
But here's the straight-up truth: getting rejected isn't failing. Not ever. And this isn't just tech talk. Whether it's job interviews, creative pursuits, or anything you care deeply about, those "no's" are just part of the process. The real failure? Giving up. Letting those setbacks crush your spirit and silence your drive.
Every attempt, every interview, every submission – it's all data. You learn, you adapt, you get tougher. Sometimes it's about the fit, sometimes it's just luck of the draw. It doesn't diminish your worth or your talent.
So, yeah, I've faced a mountain of rejections since day one. And you know what? It hasn't stopped me. It's fueled me. It's made me stronger. So the next time that "thanks, but no thanks" lands, remember this: keep going. Keep pushing. The only way to truly fail is to stop trying.

A set is a collection of unique data; therefore, no element within a set can be duplicated, eg, True and 1 or False and 0.
They are useful in membership testing because they use a hash table under the hood, and to eliminate duplicate entries, eg, storing information about student IDs. 
Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In information theory, data compression, source coding,[1] or bit-rate reduction is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation.[2] Any particular compression is either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information.[3] Typically, a device that performs data compression is referred to as an encoder, and one that performs the reversal of the process (decompression) as a decoder.
The process of reducing the size of a data file is often referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding: encoding is done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted.[4] Source coding Pshould not be confused with channel coding, for error detection and correction or line coding, the means for mapping data onto a signal.
Data Compression algorithms present a space-time complexity trade-off between the bytes needed to store or transmit information, and the Computational resources needed to perform the encoding and decoding. The design of data compression schemes involves balancing the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources or time required to compress and decompress the data.[5]]]></summary>

With the scheduler, you can automatically execute mapping tasks at scheduled intervals.
You can configure the scheduler with various execution timings, such as:
At a specific time every hour

At a specific time daily

At a specific time on specified days of the week

At a specific time on specified days of the month

At fixed time intervals (repeated execution)
In addition to time-based scheduling, file triggers are also supported.

File trigger means the task will be executed automatically when a file change is detected in a specified folder, such as:
🔹 When a new file is created

🔹 When an existing file is updated

🔹 When a file is deleted
This allows you to automatically start a task when a file arr…]]></summary>

In a May 13 announcement, Tether said its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt), has been listed on Thai exchange Maxbit.
According to an X announcement by Maxbit, the platform is the first in Thailand to offer a “tokenized gold pair backed by physical gold.”
Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a gold-backed digital asset with a market cap of $802 million, with each XAUt representing ownership of one troy ounce of gold.

Tether Gold’s entrance in the Thai cryptocurrency market follows other notable stablecoin-related regulatory developments in the country.
In March, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission approved US dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across Thailand.

In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

In a May 12 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, prosecutors recommended Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentence Council to two years in prison for his role in posting a message to the social media platform X suggesting that the SEC had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time in January 2024.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. 
Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lap via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.
