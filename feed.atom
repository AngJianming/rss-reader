Those arrested include several minors, with charges against them including kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and criminal conspiracy, Le Parisien reported on May 26.
French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.
In one recent alleged kidnapping attempt on May 13, three men tried to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, in broad daylight in Paris.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧠 Introduction


Closures are one of the most powerful—yet confusing—features in JavaScript. If you've ever wondered how JavaScript "remembers" variables after a function has run, this post is for you.
By the end, you’ll understand what closures are, why they matter, and how to use them like a pro.
A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even after that outer function has finished executing.
In simple terms:
A closure lets a function access variables defined outside its scope—even after the outer function is done running.
function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
  };
}

const counter = outer();

counter(); // Count is: 1
counter(); // Count is: 2
counter(); // Count is: 3

✅ Even though outer() has finished running, inner() still has access to count. That’s closure in action.
Data Privacy (Encapsulation)





function createSecret() {
  let secret = '🕵️‍♂️';

  return {
    getSecret: () => secret,
    setSecret: val => secret = val
  };
}

const obj = createSecret();
console.log(obj.getSecret()); // 🕵️‍♂️
obj.setSecret('🔐');
console.log(obj.getSecret()); // 🔐

👉 Variables like secret stay hidden from the outside world.
Function Factories





function multiplier(factor) {
  return function (x) {
    return x * factor;
  };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

👉 double is a closure that remembers factor = 2.
Closures inside loops can be tricky:
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Output: 3, 3, 3

let:





for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 2

Closures are everywhere in JavaScript—from callbacks and event handlers to React hooks and private state.
Mastering them will deepen your understanding of how JavaScript really works.

In this reality, it is important for developers and architects to understand the differences between sharding vs partitioning. 
Two of the most widely used strategies for handling the challenge of building data-intensive applications are sharding and partitioning. Both work by splitting large datasets into smaller chunks that are easier to manage. The difference is that sharding distributes these chunks across different computers, while partitioning does this within the same database server.

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.It is created by Facebook and released public in 2015
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
It's like REST, but you only ask for the data you need.
Ask for what you need,get exactly that

GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. 
While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request.

In this post, I’ll walk you through everything I’ve learned about how a TCP connection flows from a client, through the operating system, into a Rust async program, and how .await uses wakers and polling to manage thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph that have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.

“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a ‘bad idea’
Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the invest…]]></summary>

Partners in the project include the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Dubai Future Foundation, according to an announcement from the Dubai government. The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase.
On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its rules to include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing such tokens to be traded on secondary markets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…]]></summary>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…]]></summary>
