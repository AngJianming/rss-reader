        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Smart contract platform Rootstock, the home of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, saw a sharp increase in network security and mining engagement in the first quarter of 2025, even as activity cooled.
Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s fast-paced digital world, automation isn't just about scripts and single-task bots — it's about collaboration between intelligent agents. This is where Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) come into play.
A Multi-Agent System is a group of autonomous, intelligent agents that interact with each other to solve complex problems. These agents can be software programs, robots, or a combination of both.
Think of it like a team of specialists, each with their own role, working together to achieve a common goal.
Scalability: Each agent handles a specific task, so systems scale more easily.
Flexibility: Agents can join or leave without disrupting the whole system.
Resilience: Distributed agents reduce the risk of single points of failure.
Autonomous vehicles coordinating traffic
Smart factories with robot teams
Finance: Automating underwriting, KYC, and claims with AI agents
Healthcare: Distributed diagnosis and treatment planning
One example is platforms like Digital ClerX, a vertical AI agent platform enabling businesses to deploy multiagent systems faster. The platform offers pre-trained AI agents that integrate with your enterprise systems to seamlessly automate complex workflows, such as underwriting, KYC, Accounts Payable, etc. Each agent specializes in a domain (e.g., document parsing, validation, communication) and collaborates with other agents to complete end-to-end processes.
Want to explore MAS? Here are some useful resources:
Multi-Agent Systems in AI – Stanford CS
AIMA: Multiagent Systems Chapter
OpenAI's AutoGPT and beyond
Multi-agent systems represent the next evolution in automation and AI — decentralized, intelligent, and collaborative. As these systems mature, developers will play a key role in designing, deploying, and managing these intelligent swarms.

With its signature golden arches and iconic menu items, it’s a go-to stop for millions of people around the world—including in the UK. But what exactly can you expect from the McDonald’s UK menu? Spoiler: it’s more than just burgers and fries.
Let’s break it down and explore everything from breakfast to dessert, including options for meat-lovers, vegetarians, and budget-conscious eaters.
Classic Favourites
Chicken lovers can opt for the McChicken Sandwich, McCrispy, or Chicken McNuggets. The McNuggets, made with 100% chicken breast in a crispy coating, are one of the most popular items on the menu for good reason—they're golden, crunchy, and perfect for dipping in McDonald’s wide range of sauces.
The Saver Menu: Budget-Friendly Bites
Breakfast Options
There are also healthier options like porridge pots and fruit bags, making it easier for people to grab a nutritious start to the day.
Wraps, Salads, and Veggie Choices
Sides, Desserts, and Drinks
For dessert, the McFlurry stands out with flavours like Oreo, Maltesers, or Smarties. There’s also the beloved Apple Pie, Chocolate Brownie, and seasonal desserts that rotate throughout the year.
Drinks range from fizzy favourites like Coca-Cola Zero and Fanta, to milkshakes, fruit smoothies, and a full McCafé range of coffees, including cappuccinos, flat whites, and hot chocolate.
Delivery and Customisation
Final Thoughts
So next time you’re wondering what to eat, don’t overlook the golden arches—they’ve got you covered morning, noon, and night.]]></summary>

What is wc?
Core wc Commands
Real-World Scenario: wc Command
Conclusion
Let's Connect

Welcome back to Day 15 of this practical Linux challenge! Today, we are diving into one of the most useful Linux commands: wc.

wc?


wc stands for word count. It is a simple but powerful tool used to count:
Lines
Words
Characters
Bytes
Longest line length
It is often used when inspecting files or piping output from other commands.

wc Commands


More commonly used wc commands are listed in the table below.



Option
Description




-l
Count lines


-w
Count words


-c
Count bytes


-m
Count characters


-L
Print length of longest line




wc Command


Let's create a file and fill it with random words, then perform some wc commands.
Create a file called wcdemo.txt

Check the number of lines in this file




wc -l wcdemo.txt      # This counts the lines in the file


Count the number of words




bash
wc -w wcdemo.txt 



Count the number of characters




bash
wc -m wcdemo.txt 



Count the longest line of the file




bash
wc -L wcdemo.txt 




The wc command is one of those small but mighty tools that makes daily Linux life easier. Whether you are scripting, auditing, or just curious about your system, wc gives you quick stats that help drive smarter decisions.

🎙️ I recently attended a really eye-opening talk called “Meta Concerns in ML Security and Privacy” by a professor from the University of Waterloo. It wasn’t your usual technical deep dive—it focused more on the big picture of how we can keep machine learning (ML) systems safe in the long run.
🌟 Why This Talk Was So Interesting
What really stuck with me was this:
🔑 What I Learned
🤖It’s tricky to prove who actually “owns” a trained model. Techniques like watermarking (hiding info inside the model) or fingerprinting (adding unique traits) might help, but they’re not perfect and can be hard to verify.
👀 Different Attackers = Different Problems
⚠️ Too Many Defenses Can Backfire
🧩 No One-Size-Fits-All Fix
🛠️ Amulet Toolkit
💭 My Final Thoughts
If you’re working on anything with AI or ML, I’ll leave you with this question:
“Are we solving the right problems—or just the easy ones?” 🤔
Real security isn’t about reacting to problems—it’s about being ready before they even happen. 🧠👣🚀]]></summary>

The tools you select can either empower your team or lead to disengagement, inefficiency, and missed opportunities. As companies continue to refine their digital collaboration strategies, understanding what makes or breaks these platforms is essential—especially when it comes to high-impact formats like the 1 on 1 meeting agenda.
The Rise of Virtual Meeting Platforms in a Remote-First World
Must-Have Features That Drive Effective Virtual Collaboration
1. Reliable Audio and Video Quality
2. Integrated Agenda and Note-Taking Tools
3. Scheduling Automation and Time Zone Management
4. Breakout Rooms and Small Group Features
5. Security and Privacy Controls
The Human Element: **Why 1-on-1 Meetings Matter More Than Ever

As the work-from-anywhere trend continues, several innovations are shaping the next generation of meeting platforms:
AI-Powered Meeting Summaries: Tools like Otter.ai and Fireflies use AI to transcribe meetings and highlight key decisions or action items—ideal for leaders managing multiple direct reports.
Mood and Engagement Trackers: Newer platforms are experimenting with passive feedback tools, like mood indicators and micro-pulse surveys during meetings, to help managers better read the virtual room.
Asynchronous Video and Audio: Not every conversation needs to be live. Apps like Loom and Claap allow users to share quick video updates, freeing up calendars and reducing meeting fatigue.
Customization for Culture Fit: From branded meeting rooms to icebreaker prompts and shared playlists, platforms are focusing on building human connection in the virtual space.
Final Thoughts
1 on 1 meeting agenda, backed by a reliable and intuitive platform, empowers managers to build stronger relationships, drive performance, and retain top talent. In a world where face-to-face interactions are rare, your meeting platform is your culture—make sure it works for you, not against you.]]></summary>

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing.

After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily.

Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.

Zhao, also known as CZ, said on a Farokh Radio podcast episode aired May 6 that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers have already filed the paperwork on his behalf
“I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US.
Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.”
He added that Trump’s pardon of three BitMEX founde…]]></summary>

According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company's local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. 
Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?

The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.
