        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.
“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

Yet, more than 70% of cloud initiatives underperform or exceed budgets not because cloud doesn’t deliver, but because businesses jump in without a roadmap.
So, how do you get cloud adoption right?
We’ve helped scaleups, SaaS providers, fintechs, and manufacturers transition from scattered infrastructure to strategic cloud foundations. This post explains what a successful cloud adoption strategy should include and why skipping this step can cost you more than just compute hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Instagram account of former US rap trio Migos was hacked in an apparent attempt to blackmail Solana co-founder Raj Gokal.
On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph, which have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal said “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid.”
Another image posted by the account hacker shows what the caption claimed was Gokal’s wife holding up a driver’s license, while a further two images appear to be a dump of private information, including mobile phone numbers and email addresses.
The type of photos posted, where a person holds personal identifying documents in clear view of the camera with their face visible, are commonly used by crypto exchanges in Know Your Customer checks.
However, it is unknown where the photos seemingly depicting Gokal and his wife originated and how they ended up being used in the apparent blackmail attempt.
The Solana Foundation and Gokal were contacted for comment.
Gokal had posted to X on May 20 that attackers had “been trying to take control” of his email and social media accounts, warning his followers to be suspicious of any out-of-the-ordinary posts.

Attackers have been trying to take control of my email, social media, Google, Apple, etc. this past week. If you see anything suspect (token launch, soliciting funds, etc) that means they got through. 
be careful out there

“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows.
While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including US President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index).
