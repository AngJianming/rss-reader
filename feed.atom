        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just finished the Google whitepaper, and it has a very detailed and solid breakdown of AI agents.
My takeaways:
Prompt Engineering Techniques:  ReAct, CoT (Chain of Thought), and ToT (Tree of Thoughts) are ways to guide the agent's reasoning.
Tool Types: Extensions, functions, and data stores – the building blocks for agents to interact with the world. 
Targeted Learning: In-context learning (one-shot/few-shot - quick but can be hit or miss), retrieval-based (more complex but flexible), and fine-tuning (more effort upfront for better results).
Out of the OpenAI guide, the Anthropic blog, and this Google paper, I'd say the whitepaper gave the most detailed overview so far.
Still eager to find a cool project to build to put this knowledge into practice!
If you're also exploring AI Agents, what resources have you found most helpful?

Storing secrets securely, restricting access, and ensuring traceability are all non-negotiable requirements when dealing with cardholder data or sensitive environments. In Dockerized deployments, this requires shifting away from traditional approaches and adopting purpose-built strategies to meet both security and regulatory standards.
A common pitfall is embedding secrets directly in images or passing them as environment variables. Both practices expose sensitive data at rest or in memory, violating multiple PCI-DSS controls. Instead, secrets should be injected at runtime through controlled, auditable, a…]]></summary>

Best Practices from the Backend Trenches
Keep It DRY:


Validate Early, Fail Fast:


Readability Is Power: 


Understand the SQL Under the Hood:



Data Structures, Algorithms, and Real-World Relevance
What Comes Next: AI and APIs
As we head into API development and AI integrations (like the OpenAI API), the need for efficient, reliable backend logic becomes even more critical.

Among these features is the powerful yet often overlooked replicate() method. This method allows developers to efficiently duplicate an existing Eloquent model instance, excluding its primary key and timestamps by default. Let’s explore how replicate() works, when to use it, and some practical examples.
replicate() in Laravel?


The replicate() method creates a shallow clone of an existing model instance. It copies all attributes except the model’s primary key and other default fields such as created_at and updated_at.

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Saqib said the government of Pakistan followed the United States’ lead in establishing a Bitcoin strategic reserve and is embracing pro-crypto regulatory policies. The government official told the audience:
"Today is a very historic day. Today, I announce the Pakistani government is setting up its own government-led Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, and we want to thank the United States of America again because we were inspired by them."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key point:

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cork Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, was hit by a smart contract exploit on May 28, resulting in the loss of roughly $12 million in digital assets.
Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.
The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …]]></summary>

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.
