97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I took over a project for a client recently, I discovered they were spending nearly $1,000 monthly on AWS infrastructure despite having fewer than 5 active users. This is how I fixed it.
The Problem
Poorly designed Flask backend
Everything running in development mode on expensive AWS EC2 instances
A client who had just laid off their team and needed an MVP launched
The Solution
Purchased two high-performance dedicated servers from Hetzner
Self-hosted Coolify as a Platform-as-a-Service solution
Containerized all application components
Implemented CICD with Github for streamlined deployments.
Migrated everything away from AWS
For those unfamiliar, Coolify is an open-source alternative to Netlify or Heroku that can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure.
The Results
80% reduction in monthly infrastructure costs (from ~$1,000 to ~$<200)
More stable environment with proper containerization
Simplified deployment process
Full control without vendor lock-in
Key Takeaway
Before automatically choosing the most popular cloud provider, consider alternatives like Hetzner combined with self-hosted PaaS solutions like Coolify. For many early-stage startups, this approach provides the right balance of developer experience and cost-efficiency.
Sometimes the best technical solution isn't the most expensive one.
Upcoming
Self-host Coolify on your own infrastructure
Host your own services like analytics, project management tools, interactive forms like Formspree, and much more.]]></summary>

If you're developing a Flutter application, you may encounter the ProviderNotFoundException error, as described in the sample you provided. This error indicates that the BuildContext used does not have access to the Provider you're trying to access, which can be particularly tricky when managing state across multiple screens or routes in your Flutter app.
Understanding the ProviderNotFoundException
The ProviderNotFoundException occurs when a widget tries to read a provider that hasn't been set up in its ancestor widget tree. This commonly happens in several scenarios:
Hot Reload Issues: After adding a new provider, if you perform a hot reload instead of a hot restart, the application state may not fully recognize the new provider.

I started my journey into the world of crypto with a lot of doubts. I thought:
"If anything, I’d invest in ETH, not Bitcoin."
But even then, I was concerned about the environmental impact.
Reading more, I discovered that Ethereum had transitioned to a more sustainable consensus mechanism — Proof of Stake (PoS) — unlike Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW). That helped ease my conscience a bit.
But that was just the first hurdle.
I set up my wallet and opened an account on a crypto exchange. That part was fairly smooth — I'm a software engineer, so I know my way around tech.
Still, I found myself uneasy about usability and safety. Crypto addresses are long, unreadable strings, and one wrong character could mean losing your funds fo…]]></summary>

If you're writing a simple text editor in C and encountering issues with your text disappearing when using the Backspace key at the beginning of a line, you're not alone. Many newcomers face unexpected behavior in their text manipulation functions. This article will dive into why this happens, particularly focusing on how Backspace interacts with your cursor position and text storage.
Understanding the Issue
In your C text editor code, when you press the Backspace key (ASCII 8), you're performing different operations depending on the cursor's current position. If the cursor is at the beginning of a line (cursor_x = 0), the function tries to merge the current line with the preceding line using strcat.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know you can create dynamic routes in Next.js with just four lines of code?
As a freelancer working on front-end projects to pay the bills (thanks, American healthcare system), I recently discovered how to create dynamic routes in Next.js without any extra complications.
The Problem
I was tasked with creating a list of dashboards for Annual Performance Reviews (APR). Each APR has a unique name, and each one needs its own route, like: 
http://localhost:3000/apr/[ReviewType]
With a large dataset containing various types of APRs, manually creating each route by making individual folders inside the app directory wasn’t feasible:
-- app


Manually replacing review[index].type with the actual review types from my data would be tedious and inefficient.
The Solution
I simplified the structure by creating a single folder: 
-- app


Using square brackets in a folder name creates what Next.js calls a Dynamic Segment. With a Dynamic Segment, you can access all the parameters using the useRouter hook.
In my case, I didn’t need to use the hook because I already had the review types, and the slugs in the URL matched those types. The solution was straightforward: 
const reviewType = reviewsType.find((rt) => rt.slug === params.reviewType);
The {params} are the props in the page.jsx file of my Dynamic Route. If the reviewType from the URL matches the slug type, it’s a valid reviewType, and I can create the slug.
It’s that simple. Later, I'll call the Links with their href destination to generate the user’s click in the sidebar component: 
reviewsType.map((rt) => <Link href={/apr/${rt.slug}}> {rt.title} </Link>);
Conclusion
Next.js routing is incredibly powerful and easy to use. I’m excited to continue exploring all of Next.js’s capabilities and preparing a course for developers like me. If you’re proficient in web development but new to Next.js, join our community learning sessions. Live sessions and recordings will be available!

If enough requests arrive, even legitimate-looking ones, the backend will scale automatically and incur that cost — and the account owner will receive the bill.
This is not an exception. It is the intended behavior.

Several public cases illustrate how cloud billing can be exploited or spiral out of control:
  $100K in 24 hours via Firebase – A WebGL hosting app saw a sudden traffic spike and was billed over $100,000. The cloud service scaled perfectly. No failure occurred — other than financial.
  One public file in Firebase = $98K – A single shared file led to massive egress usage and a near six-figure bill.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US federal court for the Southern District of New York has sentenced former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison for fraud. 
Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from President Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.
To address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.
