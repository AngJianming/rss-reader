A schematic diagram is a graphical representation of an electronic circuit.

It shows how components like resistors, capacitors, ICs, and connectors are connected on the board.
Helps in diagnosing hardware issues
Saves time in troubleshooting
Improves your understanding of board-level repair
GND (Ground): Usually marked with a downward triangle


VCC / VBAT: Main power lines


Resistor (R), Capacitor (C), Inductor (L)


U, Q, D labels: Indicate ICs, transistors, diodes
Start from the battery input, trace the voltage line, check for filters or protection ICs, and identify where the current flow might be interrupted.
Use a multimeter alongside the schematic to test continuity and voltage levels on each section of the board.

In this article, we will explore how to write a SELECT SQL query in Oracle 19c to identify the latest account numbers from specific groups based on the previous account numbers. This technique can be beneficial when managing hierarchical data structures where records are interconnected through identifiers. By utilizing SQL, we can efficiently retrieve the latest entries for each group from a dataset.
Understanding the Data Structure
The given dataset consists of two columns: Account Number and Previous Number. The Account Number represents the current identifier, while the Previous Number indicates the preceding account number in the group hierarchy. With this structure, we can determine the latest account number for each defined group.
To visualize the dataset:

Every morning, we grab our phones and open a weather app. But ever since I started my 30-day Linux challenge, I‚Äôve been doing it differently.
terminal. Yes, the terminal!
if you need an umbrella. 
üîπ What You‚Äôll Learn:
Check the weather using curl and wttr.in

Customize output
Add an alias for quick access
üîπ Step-by-Step Tutorial (With Code Blocks)
Let‚Äôs get into how you can check the weather right from your Linux terminal. No weather apps, no browser ‚Äî just pure terminal magic. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ö°
‚úÖ Step 1: Open Your Terminal
You can open it by pressing:

‚úÖ Step 2: Use curl with wttr.in
This command shows you the weather forecast in your current city using the terminal:

‚úÖ Step 3: Check Weather for a Specific City
Want to check the weather in Delhi, UK, or USA? Just add the city name:


‚úÖ Step 4: Customize the Output

üéØ Metric Units (Celsius)

üßº No ASCII Graphics (Plain Output)

‚úÖ Step 5: Create a Weather Shortcut (Alias)
Want to type weather instead of writing the full command every time?
.bashrc or .zshrc file. In my Case, I'm using .zshrc file. 
Edit your .zshrc file with nano ~/.zshrc.

Add the alias to .zshrc with alias weather="curl wttr.in"

Save and exit the editor




Press Ctrl + X to exit.
Press Y to confirm changes.
Press Enter to save the file.

To write something in the terminal or display text, you can use commands like:
echo: For printing messages.
cat >: To write multiple lines into a file.
nano: For directly editing files in the terminal.
tee: For displaying text and saving it to a file simultaneously.
These simple commands let you write, edit, and manage text efficiently from the terminal.

Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors‚Äô appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

88% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000‚Äì$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin‚Äôs (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.¬†

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold‚Äôs climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold‚Äôs march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research‚Äôs head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù by many, if the precious metal surges even higher? 
BTC price jumped 6x last time gold rallied  
Bitcoin has historically delivered far more substantial gains than gold when their markets rally concurrently.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious ‚Äî illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast ‚Äî but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds ‚Äî sometimes thousands ‚Äî of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup¬†survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights ‚Äúconstraints and gaps in funding for education,‚Äù the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
‚ÄúWe hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.‚Äù
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its ‚ÄúIgnite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance‚Äù to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you‚Äôre not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let‚Äôs unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump‚Äôs memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today‚Äôs exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.
