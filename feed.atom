In 2025, offshore services is s strategy used by many companies to stay competitive in this digital era. 
Many companies see offshore development as a cost-saving option but let me clear. Apart from cost, it also offers agility and innovation. Predictions states that it will reach to $389.7 billion by 2033, compared to $151.9 billion in 2025. These stats displays the confidence businesses are showing in offshore teams to offer high-quality and scalable software solutions. 
Cost Efficiency
For example skilled developers from India only charge between $20-50 per hour, whereas Latin America and Eastern Europe provide same expertise with higher rates.
Businesses can use this cost advantage to operational expenses, recruitment, and infrastructure. This makes offshore development a budget friendly option for startups and as well as enterprises.  
Access to Global Talent

A weak password policy allows users to set short, common, or guessable passwords. For example, passwords like "123456", "admin", or "password" are still widely used.

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[n the age of remote work, trust isn't optional—it's engineered. For distributed teams, DevOps is no longer just about CI/CD pipelines and toolchains—it's about automating the foundations of collaboration, security, and accountability across time zones and teams.
At CorporateOne, we work with remote-first engineering orgs to help them scale DevOps culture without compromising security or velocity. Here’s what we’ve learned.
🌍 Remote DevOps = Operational Trust
Trust is no longer assumed—it's built through systems.
✅ You need:
Automated tests as gatekeepers, not suggestions
Immutable deployments for traceability
Slack-integrated alerts and audit logs
The outcome? A workflow that is observable, repeatable, and self-documenting. Remote developers don’t need to ask, “What changed?”—they can just look.
⚙️ Tooling for the Distributed Stack
Here’s what we recommend:
Need    Tool Suggestion Why
Remote DevOps isn’t about “doing more”—it’s about removing friction between shipping code and building trust.
🧠 Culture Over Configuration
Some practical team norms we’ve seen work:
“No one deploys alone.” Even remote, use paired approvals or staggered rollouts.
“Docs or it didn’t happen.” Update runbooks and wikis like they’re code.
“Asynchronous by default.” Status updates and approvals should never be a bottleneck.
Trust in distributed teams isn’t built in Slack threads—it’s built in code reviews, pipelines, and predictability.
🌐 How CorporateOne Supports DevOps Teams
We’re focused on helping teams:
Automate process governance
Foster high-velocity shipping without burnout
Build a resilient, transparent DevOps culture
Because the future of software isn't just remote—it's resilient, repeatable, and real-time.
📎 Let’s build trust through better pipelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Go, a goroutine is a fundamental concept used to achieve concurrency. It allows functions or methods to run independently alongside other functions. Goroutines are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and provide a simple way to handle tasks that can operate concurrently.
A goroutine is a function that runs concurrently with other functions in the same address space. It is created by placing the keyword go before a function call. For example:
go doWork()

This statement starts a new goroutine to execute the doWork() function, allowing the current program to continue executing without waiting for doWork() to complete.
Goroutines are a key part of Go’s approach to concurrency. They are ideal for tasks such as:
Handling multiple incoming network connections
Performing I/O operations without blocking
Running background computations
To coordinate and share data between goroutines, Go provides a feature called channels. Channels allow safe communication between goroutines and help prevent issues like race conditions.
ch := make(chan string)

go func() {
    ch <- "Task completed"
}()

message := <-ch
fmt.Println(message)

In this example, the goroutine sends a message through the channel, and the main function receives it. This synchronization ensures that data is passed safely between concurrent tasks.]]></summary>

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure.

A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s, “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.”
Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. 
Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of les…]]></summary>

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.
