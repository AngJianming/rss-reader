        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, guys, today I want to analyze the Array Manipulation problem from Hackerrank. We will take a look at a suboptimal solution, which is naturally easiest to figure out. Then we will discuss, analyze, and understand an optimized version that solves this problem which uses prefix sum and a difference array to achieve the needed time complexity.
For starters, this is the link to the problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/crush/problem?h_l=interview%5B%5D=interview-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=arrays
Short problem description:

So, we have "n" which is the length of the array that we will populate, taking the data from the double LinkedList queries parameter. 
For example, the linked list contains the following data: 
queries = [[1,5,3],[4,8,7],[6,9,1]]
each sublist has 3 inte…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Organizational Behaviour (OB) is the study of how individuals, groups, and structures influence behaviour within organizations.
It seeks to understand and improve employee performance, satisfaction, and wellbeing.  
  
Analogy: Think of an organization as an orchestra. OB studies each musician (individual), how they play together (group dynamics), and the conductor’s role (management and structure) to create harmony (organizational effectiveness).  
Enhances Performance

• By understanding motivation and leadership, managers design roles that boost productivity (e.g., Google’s team studies on effective collaboration).  


Improves Job Satisfaction

• Insight into employee needs and culture reduces turnover and fosters loyalty (e.g., flexible benefits at tech firms).

GCP Compute is an on-cloud VM to run everything like your own machine.
We'll deploy a simple http web server container and make it accessible from anywhere.
GCP account (with Compute API enabled + get your projectID)
Gcloud CLI 
Terraform
We'll use terraform to quickly set this up. Terraform configs are written with "*.tf" 

First, make a "config.tf" file (or whatever you want, doesn't matter), and write these:
Define GCP to be the provider:
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "6.8.0"

Terraform acts as a middleman, where its:  us <-> terraform <-> aws/gcp/etc
So we ask it to use the terraform provider SDK for GCP services to be setup, this is the terraform block

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article talks about the big chance for startups in open source AI. Just like RedHat and GitLab built big companies from open source projects, we see a similar path for AI. We are looking for companies that build around open source AI models like DeepSeek and Llama. There is a real need for support and services to help businesses use these AI tools.
We want to fund enterprise open source AI. Think about how things changed before. First, we had proprietary Unix. Then came Linux, and after that, Red Hat. Red Hat built a huge business by offering support for Linux.
Another example is BitKeeper. Then we got Git, and that led to GitHub and GitLab. These companies made a lot of money by helping people use open source tools.
We think there is a huge chance to build startups that offer support and services for open source AI. Many organizations that release open source code do not want to focus on giving commercial support. For example, Google and Facebook open source many tools. But they do not seem excited about giving commercial support for all businesses that want to use them. This creates a chance for startups.
Many winners will come from open source AI. With DeepSeek launching, there is a lot of new ground for founders to cover. They can help businesses use these systems. If you want to build an open source AI for the enterprise, we want to hear from you.
  Big Chance: There is a big chance for startups in open source AI.
  Support Needed: Businesses need support and services for open source AI.
  New Models: New models like DeepSeek create new chances.
  Enterprise Focus: We are looking for companies that focus on enterprise open source AI.]]></summary>

React Native 0.80 is knocking on our doors with its Release Candidate (RC) versions.
Now with commit links for the curious minds! 😉
There are always those changes that can break things. Keep an eye on the following:
Revamped Welcome Screen: The default NewAppScreen has been redesigned and moved to react-native/new-app-screen (3cf0102007).
Stricter Imports: With the introduction of "exports" in package.json (319ba0afd2, 9fc2a9b9e6), importing from internal folders (e.g., react-native/Libraries/...) may no longer work. Stick to official paths! Direct imports from react-native/virtualized-lists are now blocked (be8393c41b).
Component Naming: New ESLint rule (via eslint-plugin-react-hooks v5.2.0): component names can no longer start with _ (4de592756b).

It facilitates drift detection. - a critical feature for maintaining the integrity of your cloud resources. This blog post aims to demystify drift detection in AWS CDK, contrasting it with the cdk diff command, and providing a practical example to illustrate its application.
Drift detection in AWS CloudFormation identifies discrepancies between the actual state of your stack resources and their expected configurations as defined in your templates.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format used widely in APIs, configuration files, and web applications. At its core, JSON organizes data into key-value pairs, making it easy to read and parse. In this article, we’ll break down the components of a JSON object, explain common terminology, and demonstrate how to work with JSON in real-world scenarios.
1. What Are Keys and Values in JSON?


A JSON object consists of keys and their corresponding values, structured like this:
{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": 100,
    "key3": true
}

Key Features




Keys (or properties) → Always strings (enclosed in quotes "").


Values → Can be strings, numbers, booleans (true/false), null, arrays ([]), or even nested objects ({}).


Key-Value Pair → The combination of a…]]></summary>
