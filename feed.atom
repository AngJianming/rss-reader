My team pushes releases weekly, and I count on our apps to perform—every feature, every tap. Last sprint, our payment app crashed for users who tapped too fast. Automation missed it, but a tester’s curiosity caught it. That’s exploratory testing—human intuition diving where scripts don’t go. In April 2025, as DevOps races and automation dominates, exploratory testing remains my app’s safety net. This isn’t a tech-heavy lecture or a buzzword parade. It’s my story of why exploratory testing is vital in today’s rapid dev world, told from my perspective as someone who needs apps to shine.
In a world of CI/CD pipelines and automated scripts, exploratory testing feels like a craft. It’s not about following a checklist—it’s…]]></summary>

At the core of every computer is the Central Processing Unit (CPU), a tiny chip made from silicon. This chip contains billions of transistors-microscopic switches that can be turned on or off, representing binary states 1 and 026. These binary states form the fundamental language of computers, known as the binary system12.

The Next Image Component is the built-in image optimization solution for Next.js. It extends the native HTML <img> element with built-in features for automatic image optimization. Image offers image optimization features such as automatic image compression, resizing, caching, and converting images to more efficient formats like WebP where possible. 
These features significantly improve the user and developer experience. By default, the Next.js default image optimization API will optimize and serve your images from the Next.js server. 
However, you can opt out of this default behavior and use other image optimization solutions such as Fastly Image Optimizer. Therefore, the Next.js Image Component is not only feature-rich but flexible as well. In this article, w…]]></summary>

But if you're a small company or a startup, do you really need to build separate native apps for Android (Kotlin), iOS (Swift), and every other platform?
Or is there a smarter way — a tool that lets you build once and still deliver a truly native experience everywhere?

After exploring the JavaScript runtime environment and V8 engine’s journey to machine code, we now look at the data structures managing code execution: the Call Stack and Memory Heap. They’re key to understanding how JavaScript handles function calls and memory.
The Call Stack tracks function execution in JavaScript using a Last In, First Out (LIFO) structure. When a function is called, a stack frame is created with details like local variables and return address. Primitives (e.g., numbers, strings) are stored directly in the stack frame, while references to non-primitives (e.g., objects) point to the Memory Heap. Once the function finishes, its frame is removed, and execution returns to the previous function.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

The restaking narrative has moved fast — from side conversations in validator circles to the forefront of DeFi infrastructure discussions.
It’s not hard to see why. DefiLlama states that major liquid restaking protocols now hold over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), with dozens of middleware services aligning their security with Ethereum’s economic base layer. What started as an idea to increase capital efficiency for validators has evolved into a serious attempt to redefine how security is provisioned across decentralized systems.
While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.
In a race where rivals are slashing transaction times and polishing user experiences, standing still isn’t an option. To hold its ground at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 as a whole, Ethereum must keep sharpening both its exe…]]></summary>

Galaxy Digital plans to begin trading on the Nasdaq on May 16, pending shareholder and Nasdaq approval.

Nasdaq-listed crypto firms posted strong gains in April after a period of macroeconomic uncertainty.

Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz says the listing will broaden the company’s investor base and US presence.

The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listed crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital is set to move to the US-based Nasdaq on May 16, pending stakeholder approval at its upcoming shareholders meeting.
Galaxy’s planned move comes as several Nasdaq-listed crypto firms saw substantial gains in April, following a turbulent few months of macroeconomic uncertainty.
Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said on April 30 that the listing would be a milestone “that would position us to …]]></summary>

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. 
“Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. 
The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About one in four crypto tokens launched since 2021 have failed in the first quarter of this year amid a crypto market downturn and token creation becoming easier than ever, says crypto data platform CoinGecko.
Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report.
“Alarmingly, the first quarter of 2025 alone saw the collapse of 1.8 million tokens,” he added, which is “the highest number of failures recorded in a single year.” It also comprises just under half of all failures and represents a quarter of all tokens launched since 2021.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Technical charts currently show XRP (XRP) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A "falling wedge" is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading platform Robinhood has still managed to beat Wall Street estimates as its first-quarter revenues fell and its crypto trading volume cooled from a record high in Q4.
Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.
Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volum…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.
