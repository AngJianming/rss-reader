In a stark white office in Cambridge, a developer stares at a screen filled with text prompts that will direct an AI system to generate product recommendations. She believes her instructions are unambiguous and comprehensive. Six months later, the system consistently misrepresents certain product categories, creating a subtle but persistent bias that skews user recommendations. The culprit isn't a flaw in the AI's training data or a coding error—it's an assumption the developer unconsciously embedded in her prompts, treating her own cultural perspective as universal. This scenario, playing out in countless variations across the technological landscape, represents what experts now call "the assumption fallacy"—a fundamental weakness in our approa…]]></summary>

It would be better to explain some of OpenGL's concepts before we start writing code for multi-threaded systems.
Any OpenGL function that you call, always affects the currently active context. Let me explain this with an example code block.
// vertex coords
float vertices[] = {...};

// Creating a vertex buffer
unsigned int vao, vbo;
glGenVertexArrays(1, &vao);
glGenBuffers(1, &vbo);

glBindVertexArray(vao);
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);

// Copy vertices from main memory to GPU memory
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);
...

Now, in this example, the glBufferData does not take any input, that specifies which buffer it is operating on. OpenGL just executes this function on the buffer that was last bound with glBindBuffer call.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day, Neurosell, a startup developing Virton AI-based virtual fitting rooms, talked about Virton's upcoming updates, including the launch of a marketplace based on current services, as well as new pilot projects.

Today Neurosell announced a new product - a marketplace based on Virton AI. This functionality will work in parallel with the usual fitting rooms, but in addition to the usual fitting rooms, a marketplace based on applications for Google Play, Android, as well as VK Mini Apps and Telegram Mini Apps will be launched.
Every store that connects a fitting room will immediately be placed in the marketplace, thus opening up a new audience for Virton. The marketplace is scheduled to launch in June 2025.

Advanced analytics will be available to all Virton AI users in the coming weeks. This will include an overview of popular products, a look at the number of generations, generation of picks based on product popularity, and an overview of the audience cross-section, including a breakdown by day.
Already now, there is functionality to track UTM fitting room tags, which are generated automatically for each product.

Neurosell has also announced partnerships for Virton AI virtual fitting room pilots with brands such as Nishtyak Bratok, Zanovo, Murka, NashLosь, DSM Icons, Knives and other apparel brands. This helps in training the neural network even faster and better. Pilot projects are planned for six months, during which time the generation quality is expected to improve by more than 90%.
More detailed information is always available on the official Virton AI website:

Late binding is a computer programming mechanism in which the method being called upon an object, or the function being called with arguments, is looked up by name at runtime.

A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

Retired artist loses $2M in crypto to Coinbase impersonator
Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative.
Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

"The downside of the public internet is it was never built for high-performance systems. It was always built for this sort of relationship of one big server talking to one little server," Federa told Cointelegraph in an interview at Consensus 2025. The executive explained:
"We have validators all around the world. Rotating leader schedules all the time. And then they switch from having to be massive consumers of data to extremely massive broadcasters of data. So that means that they need huge amounts of resources both on ingress an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Moody's credit rating agency downgraded the credit rating of the United States government from Aaa to Aa1, citing the rising national debt as the primary driver behind the reduction in creditworthiness.
According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."
The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the c…]]></summary>

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…]]></summary>

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.
Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.
