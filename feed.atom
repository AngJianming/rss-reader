BM25 (Best Matching 25) is a foundational algorithm in information retrieval, renowned for its efficiency in keyword-based relevance scoring. While modern neural rerankers and vector search dominate advanced retrieval systems, BM25 remains a critical component in hybrid architectures and reranking workflows. This report examines BM25’s dual role in hybrid search systems and reranking pipelines, analyzing implementation patterns, use cases, and technical considerations.
Hybrid search combines keyword-based retrieval (BM25) with semantic vector search to balance precision and recall. BM25’s role here is to ensure exact keyword matches and term rarity are prioritized, while vector search captures contextu…]]></summary>

I'm working on a web-based invoice application (Angular/HTML/CSS based), and I have an issue during printing:
🖨️ Problem:
The print preview shows the invoice perfectly aligned with correct fonts, layout, and spacing.
But when I actually print it, the alignment is off, some text overflows or gets clipped, and occasionally the ink prints unevenly (bold/faint).
🎯 My Setup:
Printed from Google Chrome (latest)
HTML/CSS-based invoice template
Using @media print CSS rules for styling the print view
✅ What I've Tried:
Adjusted page margins using CSS
Set @page size and margins
Checked printer settings (A4, scaling: 100%, margin: none)
Disabled headers/footers in print dialog
Tested on different printers and browsers
❓ What I want to know:
What are the common causes of mismatch between print preview and printed output?
Are there any best practices for ensuring consistent print layouts in HTML?
Is this a CSS/HTML issue, printer driver issue, or browser-related?
Any help or resources would be appreciated!
Thanks 🙏]]></summary>

These are not mere programs or models. They are AI agents: intelligent entities capable of taking initiative, using tools, remembering information, and solving problems in open-ended environments. For developers, the implications are profound.
AI agents represent a shift from writing static applications to engineering dynamic systems that simulate human-like decision-making. This blog post explores how AI agents are redefining software development: what they are, how they work, what tools enable them, and why they’re central to the future of digital systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Foundation of Python: Lists
 Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python, allowing you to store and manipulate collections of items. Let's dive into the world of Python lists and uncover their versatility and power.
 Creating Lists
 To create a list in Python, simply enclose your elements within square brackets []:
 my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']
 Accessing and Slicing
 You can access individual elements or slices of a list using indexing. Remember, Python uses 0-based indexing:
 print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1
 
Manipulating Lists
 Lists support various operations like appending, extending, inserting, and removing elements:
 my_list.append(4)
 
List Comprehensions
 List comprehensions offer a concise way to create lists based on existing lists:
 squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
 Advanced Techniques
 Explore advanced list operations like sorting, reversing, and using lambda functions with built-in functions such as sort() and filter().
 Common Pitfalls
 Beware of mutable vs. immutable behavior when working with lists, and watch out for unintended side effects when modifying lists.
 Conclusion
 Python lists are a powerful tool for handling collections of data efficiently. By mastering lists and their operations, you can write more concise and effective code in Python.]]></summary>
