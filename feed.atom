        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you’re tired of using for loops like a caveman to search arrays? Let’s upgrade your toolkit with Binary Search, the algorithm that slices your problem in half faster than your manager cuts scope during sprint planning.
Binary search is like being the Sherlock Holmes of sorted arrays. You don’t search every element. It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. If the element exists, it returns its index. If not, it returns -1 (aka the “Nope” index).
The array must be sorted. If it's not, sort it or risk total chaos.
Recursion or iteration? Dealer’s choice.
Let’s say you’re searching for target in a sorted array nums.
Set two pointers: low = 0, high = nums.length - 1
While low <= high:


Calculate mid = low + (high - low) / 2 (Why low + (high - low) / 2? Because if you just do (low + high) / 2, you risk integer overflow, which is like watching your app crash because of math. Sad.)
If nums[mid] == target, 🎉 boom — return mid
If nums[mid] < target, move low = mid + 1
If nums[mid] > target, move high = mid - 1
If you reach here, return -1 (aka, not found 🙃)
public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
        if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        if (nums[mid] < target) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

🕵️‍♂️ Time Complexity: O(log n)
Searching in large sorted datasets (like a leaderboard)
Looking up elements in search engines or databases
Binary search trees (the cooler cousin)
Binary search is a classic for a reason. If you’re still brute-forcing searches in sorted data, stop it. Your CPU deserves better. Add this pattern to your brain cache and use it often — future you will thank you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swift’s Evolution: Trailing Commas in Function Calls in Xcode 16.3
In the world of Swift development, small syntactic changes can sometimes make a big difference in code readability and maintenance. One such change that arrived with Xcode 16.3 is the ability to include trailing commas in function call parameter lists. This seemingly minor addition brings Swift more in line with other modern programming languages and offers some practical benefits for developers.
What Changed in Xcode 16.3
func someFunction(_ input: Int...) {
    print("input is:", input)
}

// This would cause a compilation error in Xcode 16.1 and earlier
someFunction(1, 2, 3,)

However, with Xcode 16.3, the same code builds without any issues. The compiler now accepts the trailing comma after the last parameter in a function call.
Real-World Impact: The EasyPeasy Story
someView.easy.layout(
    Center(),
    Size(),
)

Notice the trailing comma after Size(). To my surprise, this code compiled perfectly in Xcode 16.3 on my local machine. However, when the same code was submitted to our continuous integration (CI) pipeline, which was running an older version of Xcode (16.1), the build failed.
Why Trailing Commas Matter
Practical Implications for Developers
Version compatibility: Code using trailing commas in function calls will only work in Xcode 16.3 and later.
CI pipeline configuration: Ensure your CI environment matches your local development environment to avoid unexpected build failures.
Team standards: Teams should establish whether to use or avoid trailing commas based on their minimum supported Xcode version.
Conclusion
However, if you’re working with codebases that need to support older Xcode versions, be careful with this feature to avoid compatibility issues. As with any language feature, it’s important to understand not just how to use it, but when it’s appropriate to do so in your specific development context.]]></summary>

Now, after many late nights wrestling with logs from 4–5 different services, I’ve realized something: microservices no longer have that same passionate appeal they once did. Why? Let me share my story in detail, hoping it will give you a more realistic perspective on microservices.
When I first discovered microservices, it felt incredibly exciting. The hype, the case studies from big players like Netflix, Amazon, Uber, and Google made me almost obsessed:
“Break your app into small parts that can be developed and deployed independently, as you wish!”
“Scale each service separately—no need to scale the whole bloated app!”

"The Rhythm of Lockers and Lessons"
A rhythmic beat of lockers, chatter, and lessons' sway.
A world where we grow, learn, and make memories that stay,
In this poem, we'll delve into school life's every way.
The morning rush, a whirlwind's sway,
Alarm clocks ringing, breakfast on-the-go each day.
A mad dash to catch the bus, minds racing ahead,
Chatter and excitement fill the air, a cacophony unsaid.
School is where friendships are formed, bonds that last a lifetime through,
Shared interests, laughter, and adventures we pursue.
Friends are our support, our confidants, and partners in every crime,
Together we navigate school life, making memories that are truly sublime.
Of course, school is about learning, growing, and developing new skills too,
Teachers guide, inspire, and challenge us to reach our full potential anew.
We discover passions, uncover hidden talents, and develop a love to learn,
Whether math, novels, or mastery, school is where our strengths and weaknesses discern.
As the school day closes, we think of what we've learned, accomplished, and can do better tomorrow,
We reflect on aspirations, dreams, and goals we hope to borrow.
It's a journey of self-discovery, navigating ups and downs with grace,
Developing resilience and determination to overcome life's every obstacle and pace.
In conclusion, school life is a beautiful symphony, a rhythmic beat,
A world where we grow, learn, and make memories that our hearts will always repeat.
As we navigate this journey, let's appreciate the little things, the moments that make us smile,
And the lessons that shape us into the people we're meant to be, all the while.

After years of working in software development—across Java, TypeScript, Go, Spring Boot, testing, automation, and even dabbling with Rust and C—I’ve finally decided to dive into programming books seriously.
Not tutorials. Not blogs. Books.

Books that shape how you think, not just what you code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[School hallways, meant to be a haven, often transform into battlegrounds where victims' cries are masked by laughter and chatter. The strong prey on the weak, and the popular torment the marginalized, bringing the shadows in the hallway to life. Bullies, wearing masks of confidence, charm, and popularity, prey on the vulnerable, using their words, actions, and social status to manipulate and intimidate. Their victims suffer in silence, afraid to speak out, and are left to walk alone, avoiding eye contact, wondering why they're not good enough, and crying themselves to sleep at night, feeling helpless and alone.
To unmask these bullies and bring them to justice, we need to create a culture of empathy and kindness. We must encourage open communication, educate our children about the devastating effects of bullying, and teach them to recognize bullying behavior. We need to create a zero-tolerance policy towards bullying, holding bullies accountable. We can all play a role in creating a bully-free environment by being an ally to victims, speaking out against bullying, and being kind, compassionate, and empathetic towards all. Together, we can make a difference, one small step at a time, and create a bully-free world where every student can walk the hallways with their head held high, without fear of intimidation or harassment.

If you work with Git, you've probably encountered remote branches that no longer exist on the remote repository but still appear in your local list. These stale branches can clutter your workspace and make it harder to navigate.
The git fetch --prune command helps clean up these outdated remote-tracking branches, keeping your local repository tidy. In this guide, we'll explain how git fetch --prune works, when to use it, and some best practices for beginners.

When you fetch updates from a remote repository, Git keeps track of remote branches using remote-tracking branches (e.g., origin/main). However, if a branch is deleted on the remote, Git doesn't automatically remove its remote-tracking branch locally.
