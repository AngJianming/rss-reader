        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright fellow devs, the AI wave is here, and even us "old school coders" are evolving! I've been shaping my workflow as a Generative Coder, trying to blend decades of experience with the power of tools like Gemini, Claude, GPT, and the speed of Cursor IDE (while still loving WebStorm for its strengths!).
My current process is a 3-step dance:
AI Huddle (with Gemini): Brainstorming needs & context.
Charting the Course: Human-led user flows & requirements.
The Generative Relay: Iterative prompting (Claude in Cursor, GPT/Gemini for second opinions), reviewing, and refining.
It's exciting, but I'm on a mission to make it perfectly efficient – fewer re-prompts, tighter loops, and more time for big-picture design. I’m an engineer, after all; it should be a crystal-clear development process! (Even if that first-shot perfect result from AI is still a dream 😉).
For a more detailed breakdown of my current tools and process, you can read the full post on my blog:
https://goker.me/my-generative-coding-workflow
But here on dev.to, I really want to hear from YOU!
What does your AI-assisted workflow look like?
Which tools are you finding indispensable?
How are you tackling the iteration cycles and review process?
What are your tips for building faster, smarter, and better as a Generative Coder?
Drop your insights, workflows, and war stories in the comments below! Let’s compare notes and learn from each other as we navigate this new era.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In HarmonyOS app development, dialogs are a very common interaction pattern, especially in scenarios where users must confirm actions or view system announcements. Sometimes, developers want to prevent dialogs from being closed by the system back key. The ArkTS @CustomDialog component does not support intercepting the system back key, but you can achieve this by using the Navigation component's NavDestination to intercept the back event and create dialogs that cannot be dismissed arbitrarily.
Use the NavDestination component and set .mode(NavDestinationMode.DIALOG) to display the page as a dialog.
Intercept the system back event by returning true in .onBackPressed(() => true), which prevents the dialog from being closed by the back key.

This article will further guide you to encapsulate the Navigation routing framework, making it suitable for more complex project structures, supporting dynamic module loading, page parameter passing, callbacks, and other advanced features to improve maintainability and scalability.
As your project grows, the number of pages and modules will increase. To facilitate management and decoupling, it is recommended to encapsulate routing logic in a unified way. The core ideas are as follows:
Use a RouterInfo class to describe each page's module name, page name, and whether it requires NavDestination.

According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt (USDT), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.
Source: Cyvers Alert
Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.
Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. …]]></summary>

In modern web development, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has become a go-to format for data interchange, especially in applications like logistics management. Its lightweight structure translates to efficient data handling between servers and clients.
JSON is a text-based format that represents structured data using key/value pairs. Its simplicity and readability make it easy for both humans and machines to work with.
One format that quietly powers most logistics platforms — from package tracking to warehouse sync — is JSON.
In this post, I’ll walk through:
What JSON really means in the context of logistics

APIs timeout, services become temporarily unavailable, and database queries may fail due to load. One common and essential solution to this is a retry mechanism, a pattern that automatically re-attempts a failed operation after a delay.
In this blog post, we’re going to explore how to build retryable asynchronous APIs using Python. We’ll walk through how to use functools.partial in combination with custom async decorators to create flexible, reusable retry logic. Let’s dive in.

On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.

H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns
US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain security firm Dedaub released a post-mortem report on the Cetus decentralized exchange hack, identifying the root cause of the attack as an exploit of the liquidity parameters used by the Cetus automated market maker (AMM), which went undetected by a code "overflow" check.
According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
"This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens."

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm's fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…]]></summary>

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.

Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid's native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why, because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply-constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers…]]></summary>

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
