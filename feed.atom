While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there's no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs
I’ve shared this idea on GitHub Discussions to get feedback from the community.

Here’s also a simple wireframe mockup of the concept:

If this sounds useful to you, please comment or join the GitHub discussion. I’d love to co-build an MVP if there’s interest.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

This helps save storage and reduce costs before uploading the images to a storage service. For this, I used Canvas to render the image data from the stream and then convert it into a blob of the required MIME type.
Canvas rendering, animation, and user interaction occur on the main thread. If the rendering and animation are intensive, they can affect performance. After a few weeks, we received feedback from users that the application felt laggy and slow. So, I decided to move the whole pipeline to a web worker. However, Canvas requires DOM access for rendering and animations, which is not available in web workers. This limitation makes using Canvas in web workers challeng…]]></summary>

I'm excited to share a new open-source project I've built: MCP Manager. Developed in Rust, this tool acts as a crucial piece of middleware designed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with and call external APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
While LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating text, connecting them reliably and securely to external systems to perform actions is still a significant challenge. Existing methods can be ad-hoc, lack standardization, or require complex custom integrations.
The only integrations I was able to found are proprietary or paid. The only real alternative is Claude for Desktop, however it is limited to the Antropic models.

Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.
This series explores a different direction:

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start <Container ID>

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log <Container ID>

$ docker exec <Conatiner ID> <Commands>

$ docker exec --interactive --tty <Container ID>

$ docker stop -t <ID>

$ docker rm <Container ID>

$ docker images

$ docker rmi <Image ID>

$ docker rmi -f <Image ID>

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag <Local-image-name> username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container & image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

The Dubai-based exchange, which processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume last year, is “actively reassessing potential opportunities” in the United States, CEO Luuk Strijers told the FT.
He cited the “recent shift toward a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto in the US” as a key motivator behind the decision.
Deribit’s potential plan to expand into the US comes amid reports that Coinbase is in advanced negotiations to acquire the platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin called for simplifying Ethereum’s base protocol, aiming to make the network more efficient, secure and accessible, drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s minimalist design.
In a blog post titled “Simplifying the L1,” published on May 3, Buterin laid out a vision to restructure Ethereum’s architecture across consensus, execution and shared components.
“This post will describe how Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin,” Buterin wrote, arguing that simplicity is key to Ethereum’s resilience and long-term scalability.
While recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust, he said that technical complexity has led to bloat…]]></summary>

“The Court finds Apple in willful violation of this Court’s 2021 Injunction, which was issued to restrain and prohibit Apple’s anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing. Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in an April 30 court filing.

“I’m not really into the whole Strategic Reserve situation,” Hayes said in a May 1 interview.
Hayes doubts print money plans for Bitcoin
“The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said.

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

Analyst predicts that a low VIX, specifically below 18, signals a risk-on market, which could potentially boost the Bitcoin price to $135,000 within the next 100 days.

The stablecoin market cap hits $220 billion, driving crypto liquidity and Bitcoin’s bullish price action.

A negative Bitcoin funding rate hints at a possible short-squeeze to $100,000.

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The cryptocurrency market continued its recovery in the past week as the total crypto market capitalization breached the $3 trillion mark for the first time since the beginning of March.
Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

Born in 2013 as a private placement, GBTC pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment, granting investors access to Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric rise without the perils of digital wallets or unregulated exchanges.
On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds. 
Even still, GBTC’s financial resilience shines, generating $268.5 million in annual revenue, surpassing the $211.8 million of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, despite losing over …]]></summary>

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

Appetite for global risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) may take another hit, with analysts from Apollo Global Management predicting a recession by the summer.
“Apollo predicting Summer Recession: Sharpest decline in earnings outlook since 2020,” cross-asset analyst Samantha LaDuc wrote in an April 26 X post.
