        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most important things I was forced to create in school was minesweeper. This is because it brings up recursion, which every programmer seems to struggle with. Heck, in university, there are many students that still don't grasp it, halfway through the degree. So when people ask how they can learn recursion, my favorite task is minesweeper. And, of course, you get a cool game out of it!
So, here's the challenge, can we make it in one day? Don't start the timer yet, we must design first, list out what we have to do. That's the good part of games like these, they are well-defined, and can be described in a page. I'll describe the game in long form, from the perspective of interactions from the user. I'll then list out notes on these features. In concept, if our application adheres t…]]></summary>

So we put it to the test—specifically against SQL injection, one of the most common and dangerous web vulnerabilities.
This post walks you through a simple demo and shows how SafeLine handles SQL injection attacks, even when the underlying application is vulnerable.
SQL injection targets applications that use SQL queries to interact with a database. When user input is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious SQL code to access or manipulate sensitive data.
For this test, we used a vulnerable demo environment called DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)—you can easily set it up for your own experiments.

Being ambitious, and being present - I'm not sure you can do both.

./install.sh: Permission denied

Or worse:
command not found

Congratulations! You've met Linux's gatekeepers: chmod and PATH. Let's dissect them without the usual jargon overdose.
What It Actually Means
Every file in Linux has permissions like a nightclub bouncer:
Read (r): "You can look at this file."


Write (w): "You can edit this file."


Execute (x): "You can run this file (if it's a script/program)."




  
  
  The chmod Command


It changes permissions. Syntax:
chmod [who][+/-][permissions] file

Examples:
chmod u+x script.sh  # u = user (you), +x = add execute

Lock down a file (read-only for everyone):
chmod 444 file.txt  # 4 = read, for user/group/others

Code in the Clouds (Literally)


While SUSL’s campus looks like a nature retreat, its Computer Science department runs:
A student-led Open-Source Society that contributes to Sri Lankan government tech projects.
An annual "Hack in the Hills" hackathon (yes, the WiFi reaches outdoor coding spots).
Research labs focused on tropical tech think flood prediction models and agri-tech for monsoon climates.
Why Open-Source Devs Should Take Notice


Real-World Impact
Student projects often tackle hyper local problems (e.g., landslide alert systems).
Many end up as public GitHub repos check their department site for links.
Zero Pretension, Maximum Hustle
No flashy Silicon Valley jargon here just frugal innovation (old PCs + big ideas).
Strong mentorship from profs who’ve built systems for Sri Lanka’s unique infra challenges.
A Different Kind of Tech Community
Where else do devs debug by lantern light during power cuts? (Bonus: no distractions!)
Campus "Code & Chai" meetups generic tech talks.
