        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building .NET applications intended for use in console environments, it's essential to design your program to be flexible. One common requirement is to detect whether input is being provided via a command pipeline (i.e., from stdin) and, if not, to perform a default action. This article explores how you can inspect the input stream in your .NET application and adjust behavior accordingly.
In Linux, the pipe operator (|) connects the output of one command to the input of another. For example:
echo "Hello, World!" | dotnet run

In this command, the output of echo is sent to your .NET application via standard input. Your application must determine whether such piped input is present in order to correctly process data or use fallback logic.
There are several methods to detect if there's d…]]></summary>

Every extra second your app takes to load, your bounce rate goes up. So, what if you could load only what the user needs, exactly when they need it? That’s where Lazy Loading comes in.
In this post, let’s walk through how to implement Lazy Loading in Angular to build highly optimized apps with better performance and lower initial load times. 🚀

Lazy loading is a design pattern in Angular that delays loading feature modules until they are needed. Instead of downloading the entire app at once, Angular loads modules on demand—keeping initial loads lean and fast.
Imagine you have a dashboard, settings panel, and an admin panel. Why load all of them upfront when the user might never visit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reactive programming is about shifting how we think about flow. Instead of writing code that constantly asks for updates, you write code that responds the moment something changes.
It means your app reacts to data as it arrives, like listening to live announcements rather than checking a board repeatedly. You work with push-based streams instead of polling, and structure your logic around events, not rigid control flow.
Instead of manually triggering logic or polling for new data, reactive code hooks into a data stream and reacts as values arrive. Your app becomes event-aware, responsive, and resilient under pressure.

Coordinates in multidimensional arrays can often lead to challenges when merging datasets or aligning data from different sources. Xarray excels at handling multidimensional labeled data, which is crucial when working with NetCDF (nc) files commonly found in climate research, meteorology, and oceanography. However, when these datasets have varying dimensions, coordinate conversion becomes necessary to achieve unity in data structure.

The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a fundamental browser security feature that prevents scripts from one website from tampering with content on another. It’s the reason your cookies, those sweet data packet treats, stay safe from nosy neighbors. While SOP is primarily enforced by web browsers, it works hand-in-hand with server-side mechanisms like CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which lets the browser know when it’s okay to loosen the restrictions for specific cross-origin requests.
An origin consists of three parts:
  The Protocol - http://, https://, ftp://, ssh://, etc.
  The Host - example.com, example2.com, example3.com, etc.
  The Port - 80, 443, 999, 8080, 8081, etc.
With this in mind, we can imagine an origin that looks like this:

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.
Countries such as Belgium, Norway and Switzerland have had wealth taxes baked into th…]]></summary>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project’s CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 
He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That’s the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  
The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.
