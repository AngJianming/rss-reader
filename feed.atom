        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Intellectual capacity refers to the ability of individuals to think, reason, analyze, and generate ideas. It encompasses both creative and critical thinking abilities, forming the foundation of innovation, education, and scientific advancement. With the rapid development and integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into various domains, questions have emerged regarding the effects on human intellectual capacity, the opportunities and challenges to creativity and critical thinking, and the implications for intellectual property (IP). This essay explores these dimensions, highlighting the benefits and limitations of GenAI while considering future directions and regulatory concerns related to intellectual property.

✅ What is H2 Database and why it's great for rapid development
💬 It felt empowering to visualize the data I’ve been creating through CRUD operations. H2 makes it super simple to debug and experiment without the overhead of setting up a full database. Perfect for beginners and local testing!
🔧 Tomorrow, I’ll build a mini project using H2 Database to bring everything I’ve learned so far into a practical use case. Time to apply those CRUD skills in a real-world scenario! 💪🔥

So I built this global variable feature - basically Redis but worse (I'm kidding... mostly). Users wanted to share state between API workflows, and I thought "how hard could it be?" Famous last words.
So a friend wanted a gamification banner - "Wheel of fortune, only 10 '20% off' vouchers available daily!" Simple enough. I whipped up an API workflow in 15 minutes:
Check inventory
If voucher stock is available, return wheel config
Deploy for ⚡ SPEED ⚡
It was beautiful. It was fast. It was also giving vouchers to 47 users because race conditions don't care about your business logic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It all starts with the BIT.


What happens when you group 8 bits together?


Bytes can represent... anything!



• A character like “A”
What it means depends on the context and how the program interprets it.
Now let’s talk images.🖼️
Images are made of pixels (tiny colored dots).
Each pixel's color is stored as a combination of bytes using models like RGB:
(Red, Green, Blue)
RGB and Color Storage 🎨
In many systems, each RGB value is stored using 1 byte (8 bits).
So 1 pixel = 3 bytes
Example:
This pixel would appear pure red.
Multiply that by millions of pixels…


So how does your image become data?


Compression makes things smaller.


Recap:



Bit = 0 or 1
Digital magic ✨
It’s wild to think every photo, emoji, and meme is just a giant sequence of 0s and 1s.
All thanks to bits, bytes, and brilliant engineering.

Initially, the SDK only supported Python. Recently, however, they announced the release of the TypeScript version of the SDK, a game changer for developers in the JavaScript ecosystem.
In a recent article, I wrote about LlamaIndex vs. LangGraph:
"But as JavaScript and TypeScript continue to dominate full-stack development, there’s a growing need for agent frameworks built natively for JS, without forcing developers to switch stacks or work around language mismatches."
This release validates that point. In this short article, we’ll walk through a hello world example using the SDK and explore its core concepts and architecture.
