        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backend development is the backbone of modern web applications. It manages server-side logic, data handling, authentication, and API communication.
In this post, we’ll explore backend dev using a JavaScript-first approach — with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as core tools.
Backend dev involves:
Managing servers
Handling databases
Writing business logic
Serving REST APIs
JavaScript (Node.js) – Great for full-stack JS
Python – Django, Flask
Java – Spring Boot
PHP/Ruby – Mature, flexible choices
SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
Use REST APIs to perform CRUD operations over HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Tools like Express.js make building APIs fast and flexible.
Express.js (Node)
Django (Python)
Spring (Java)
ORMs help abstract SQL:
Prisma (Node.js)
Hibernate (Java)
Django ORM (Python)
Middleware: Auth, logging, request validation
Authentication: JWT, sessions, OAuth
File Uploads: Multer for handling media
Third-party APIs: Stripe, SendGrid, Google Login
Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend keeps your codebase consistent and efficient. With Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB, you get speed, scalability, and simplicity.
Backend development is essential to building robust, secure, and performant applications. Whether you’re building APIs, managing databases, or integrating third-party services — the backend is where the real logic lives.

The good news: Bootstrap, one of the most popular front-end frameworks, already has built-in accessibility features—you just need to know how to use them correctly.
Let’s dive into how you can craft a user interface that works for everyone—and doesn’t require you to rebuild your UI from scratch.

Despite the rise of Swift, Objective-C remains a relevant and powerful language, particularly for maintaining legacy code and integrating with newer Swift code bases. As we move into 2025, understanding core patterns like delegation continues to be vital for developers working with Objective-C.
Delegation is a design pattern used in Objective-C to pass messages between objects and to provide a mechanism for customization of behavior. It allows one object to delegate tasks to another, enabling a clear separation of responsibilities and enhancing the modularity of applications. Typically, a delegate object implements methods from a protocol to respond to certain events or actions occurring in the deleg…]]></summary>

But as the system expanded to support more than 10 folders, it required deploying and maintaining an equal number of nearly identical Lambda functions, each wired to specific prefixes and jobs. The architecture became increasingly brittle and harder to manage. 
This post outlines how that structure was replaced using EventBridge, with prefix-based filtering and direct Glue job targets. No Lambda. No maintenance overhead.

Encapsulation is like a medicine capsule: the outer shell hides the complex ingredient inside, delivering only the intended effect to your body. You don't need to know the chemical makeup to benefit from it.
Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers. Python primarily uses two types of access modifier.
Private: Accessible from anywhere.


Public: Accessible only within the class.



Similarly, in programming, encapsulation wraps data and methods in a class, exposing a simple, controlled interface while keeping the internal details private and secure.
Let say I want to make "model" attribute private so that nobody can manipulate the model name.
So make it private just add '__model'
So, question arise if we can't access attribute but we can access function which include the private attribute.
Think of like if we have attribute which you don't want get manipulated then make it private.]]></summary>

If you're developing a MAUI application and are facing issues with the CarouselView control not displaying images from an ObservableCollection, you are not alone. This article will address why images may not show up in your CarouselView, even when the same image sources work perfectly with a standard Image control.
Understanding CarouselView in MAUI
The CarouselView in .NET MAUI is designed to display a collection of items in a swipeable format. Each item can be customized using a DataTemplate, which lets you define how each item appears. Typically, developers use ObservableCollection to bind dynamic data to CarouselView because it notifies the view of changes. However, while you may see indicators appear correctly, images may not load as expected.

A critical feature that sets it apart from other languages is its support for **dynamic typing**. This allows for a flexible development process that enhances code modularity and adaptability. But what truly is the purpose of dynamic typing in Objective-C?

## What is Dynamic Typing?

Dynamic typing refers to the ability of a programming language to determine the type of an object at runtime, rather than during compile-time. This contrasts with static typing, where the type of an object is known and enforced during compilation. In Objective-C, this means you do not have to specify the class type of an object, providing …]]></summary>

JIT mode was introduced as a way to:
Compile only the CSS classes you actually use

Speaking to Cointelegraph, the Tron public relations team confirmed that on May 2, the Tron DAO account posted a contract address and sent direct messages to solicit payments in exchange for promotional advertising on the Tron account.
“Our security team quickly identified the intrusion and cut off access to the hacker, but we ask the community to continue to be vigilant. We will never ask anyone for payments like this via DM or otherwise,” they said. 
The team said that based on the illicit contract address the hacker posted, the amount improperly solicited appeared to be around $45,000.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum.

The ETF is designed to accumulate spot BNB (BNB) tokens and “may, from time to time, stake a portion of the [fund’s] assets through one or more trusted staking providers,” according to the ETF’s S-1 prospectus. The filing marks the first time an asset manager has filed for a BNB ETF in the United States.
The BNB token has a market capitalization of roughly $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. As of May 5, BNB stakers earn a yield of approximately 2.5%, according to data from Stakingrewards.com.

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher? 
BTC price jumped 6x last time gold rallied  
Bitcoin has historically delivered far more substantial gains than gold when their markets rally concurrently.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

Global crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) have added $5.5 billion in inflows in the past three weeks, according to the latest weekly report from CoinShares.
With the new inflows, total assets under management (AUM) in all crypto ETPs worldwide jumped 3.3% from $151 billion to $156 billion.
Although the positive trend has continued for the past three weeks, the latest weekly inflows were down 41% from last week’s $3.4 billion of inflows — the third-largest crypto ETP inflows on record.
Inflows slowed down despite new Bitcoin gains
The slowdown in crypto ETP inflows came despite Bitcoin (BTC) seeing some brief gains last week, with the price rising from …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While many crypto ecosystems focus on decentralization as the core tenet of Web3, Aptos is seeing success with hybrid platforms that blend Web2 and Web3 technologies, commonly referred to as “Web2.5.”
In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that Web2.5 platforms are earning “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications, in particular, are thriving in the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications avoid full decentralization, often drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

Bitcoin failed to break the $98,000 resistance amid increased profit-taking.

BTC price needs to close above $95,000 on the daily chart for a push to $100,000.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price failed to break above resistance at $98,000 on May 3. Since April 22, BTC prices have formed daily candle highs between $93,000 and $97,900, but they could not close above $97,440.

Tether CEO Paolo Adroino took to X on May 5 to tease the imminent launch of Tether AI, the company’s new AI platform designed to offer “personal infinite intelligence.”
According to Ardoino, Tether’s AI platform will be integrated with USDt (USDT) and Bitcoin (BTC) payments, allowing users to make transactions directly through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:
“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“
