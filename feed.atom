Whether you're working on a simple mobile application or developing large-scale enterprise software, the need to find data quickly and efficiently is universal. Two fundamental algorithms used for searching are Linear Search and Binary Search. Each has its strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases, and understanding the difference between them is crucial for writing optimized code.
Linear Search, also known as sequential search, is the most straightforward method of searching. It involves checking each element of a dataset one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends. Because Linear Search does not require the dataset to be sorted, it's flexible and simple to implement. If you're working with a sma…]]></summary>

I'm currently going through #JavaScript30 — a fantastic 30-day vanilla JavaScript challenge, and today I hit Day 10.
The task?
🎯 The Goal
Let users:
Click a checkbox


Hold down Shift


Click another checkbox


✅ Automatically select all checkboxes between them



🧠 What You’ll Practice
This mini-challenge is great for improving:
Handling multiple checkbox events


Using the event.shiftKey property


Tracking user selections between clicks


Looping through elements conditionally



🚀 Your Challenge
A list of checkboxes (10+ makes it fun!)
An event listener on each checkbox
A way to remember the last checked box
Logic to check all boxes between the last and current if Shift is pressed.
🧪 Starter Hint
You’ll likely need to:
Store the last checked checkbox in a variable
Loop through all checkboxes to find the range using forEach.
Use a flag (e.g. inBetween) to mark when to check/uncheck boxes
💬 Want Help?
🔗 Bonus: Try It Live
GitHub
🕹️ When you finish it publish with the #challengewithubba hashtag, so everyone would be able to see you solution!
🎉 ENJOY!!]]></summary>

What if you could cut your database code by half while making it more robust and maintainable? In 2024, 70% of Java enterprise applications relied on the Java Persistence API (JPA) to streamline data management, saving developers countless hours of boilerplate SQL. JPA is the unsung hero that bridges your Java applications with databases, making data persistence intuitive, scalable, and error-proof. Whether you're a beginner building your first CRUD app or an enterprise architect designing complex systems, JPA empowers you to focus on business logic rather than database intricacies.

That machine, once up and running, became more than just a terminal. I used it to create a file sharing system over NFS, allowing colleagues to collaborate like never before. It was rudimentary, but for a workplace running on typewriters and dot-matrix printers, it was a revolution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Big O notation is one of the most important concepts in computer science, especially when it comes to analyzing algorithms. It helps you understand how an algorithm’s performance changes as the size of the input grows. Instead of measuring actual time or memory usage, Big O provides a high-level view of efficiency. To make this abstract idea easier to grasp, let’s break it down using real-life examples.
Imagine you’re looking for someone in a small classroom with 10 students. You check each person one by one until you find them. In the worst case, you might have to check all 10 students. This is a linear search and is considered O(n) — the time it takes increases linearly with the number of people. If the room had 100 students instead, you’d potentially need 100 steps.
