Why Package Management Is a Big Deal


Mastering the Basics: Update, Upgrade, Clean


Going Pro: Advanced Techniques


Automation: Let the System Do the Work


Troubleshooting Like a Pro


Security and Hygiene: Stay Lean, Stay Safe


Wrapping Up






Managing packages and updates isn’t just “admin work”-it’s the backbone of a stable, secure Linux environment. 
Every package you install is a potential entry point for bugs or vulnerabilities. 
Updates are your first line of defence, patching holes and keeping your system humming along. 
Ignore them, and you’re rolling out the red carpet for trouble



Every distro has its own flavour of package manager (APT, DNF, Pacman, etc.), but the fundamentals are the same:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The term RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) refers to a hybrid AI framework that combines information retrieval (like Googling) with large language models (LLMs) to deliver accurate, context-aware answers. Unlike traditional LLMs that generate responses based solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG grounds its answers in real-time, external data, minimizing errors and hallucinations.
Why RAG Matters



LLMs like GPT-4 excel at generating text but face limitations:
Static knowledge: They can’t access up-to-date or domain-specific data.
Hallucinations: They may invent plausible-sounding but incorrect facts.
RAG solves this by dynamically retrieving relevant information before generating a response, ensuring answers are factual, current, and contextually grounded.

Cointelegraph reached out to Zhelezniak for comment on the bill’s status but had not received a response by publication.

The web was not really built with payments in mind, especially not for autonomous agents or machines. But with the rise of AI and decentralized finance (DeFi), the need for seamless, native digital payments has never been more urgent. 
Coinbase x402 announced a new open protocol designed to let APIs, apps and AI agents pay instantly using stablecoins like USDC (USDC), all via the familiar HTTP protocol.
This isn’t just a product update. X402 revives a long-forgotten piece of internet infrastructure and reimagines it for a future powered by agentic systems and crypto.

When I attend conferences and similar public events, someone almost always approaches me to ask how cryptographic tokens (fungible or non-fungible) can have value even though tokens are virtual and do not exist in the physical world. It's a surprisingly common question, especially one-on-one.
Virtual objects like NFTs and cryptocurrencies are both digital and intangible; their existence is not based in the real (physical) world, and (unlike digital currencies) they generally do not have backing by real-world institutions.

The internet’s largest illicit marketplace, Haowang Guarantee, formerly Huione Guarantee, said it will shut down following Telegram’s ban of thousands of associated accounts on May 13. 
“Since all our NFTs, channels and groups were blocked by Telegram on May 13, 2025, Haowang Guarantee will cease operations from now on,” read the notice on the marketplace website.
A report from Wired said that this involved banning thousands of accounts and usernames that served as the infrastructure for the crypto crime marketplace and its vendors.

Law enforcement has been increasingly successful at tracing stolen funds and crypto ransom payments, resulting in a “lot of arrests,” Levin said during the 2025 Consensus crypto conference, covered by Cointelegraph.
“For whatever reason, there is a perception that’s out there that crypto is an asset that is untraceable, and that really lends itself to criminals acting in a certain way,” he said. 
“Apparently, the know that crypto is not untraceable hasn't been received by some of the organized crime groups that are actually perpetrating these attacks, and some of them are concentrated in, you know, France, b…]]></summary>

The firm revealed in its latest revenue report that its balance sheet has strengthened, ending the first quarter with $9.9 billion in US dollar resources.

The money laundering services were allegedly carried out on behalf of other criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking, Europol said in a May 14 statement.
Spanish authorities said the criminal organization ran a secret informal money transfer system called hawala and was often compensated in crypto.
A total of 17 individuals were arrested — 15 in Spain, one in Austria and one in Belgium — while 4.5 million euros ($5 million) worth of items were seized, including cash, crypto, 18 vehicles, four shotguns and several electronic devices.

“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won't invest in if the price isn't reasonable in the beginning.”

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitfarms clocked a first-quarter net loss of $36 million, widening from a $6 million loss in the same period a year earlier, as the Bitcoin miner pivots from mining to high-performance computing for artificial intelligence applications. 
The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

During a panel on May 14 at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, she said the NY estate is frequently asked to provide guidance on regulators. “With respect to federal regulation and legislation [...] members of Congress are often coming to us [NYDFS] asking about our process, about our regulations, about guidance, how they should be thinking about legislation,” Harris said.

In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. 
The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin's all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week.
