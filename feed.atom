        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 4 of the 180 Days of Frontend Development Challenge. Today, we'll explore how to structure text content using HTML's core text elements – the building blocks of all web content.  
Why Text Structure Matters


Properly formatted text:  
Improves readability for users

Helps search engines understand your content

Creates visual hierarchy on your page




  
  
  Core HTML Text Elements



  
  
  1. Headings (<h1> to <h6>)


Headings create content hierarchy. Use them in order from most important (<h1>) to least important (<h6>).
<h1>Main Page Title (Only use one per page)</h1>
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<h3>Subsection Heading</h3>

Best Practice:  
Use only one <h1> per page (for SEO)

Maintain logical heading order (don't skip levels)




  
  
  2. Paragraphs (<p>)

  Highlighting Keywords and Important Information with Spaces




Level: Recommendation
Description: Use spaces to highlight keywords and important information while avoiding unnecessary spaces. Follow these general guidelines:
Add a space between keywords like if, for, while, switch and the left parenthesis (.
Do not add a space between the function name and the left parenthesis ( in function definitions and calls.
Add a space between keywords like else or catch and the preceding right brace }.
Add a space before any opening brace {, except in the following cases:


When an object is the first parameter of a function or the first element of an array, no space is needed before the object. For example: foo({ name: 'abc' }).
In templates, no space i…]]></summary>

This blog post is part of a series on building a simple trading bot. In this blog post, we’ll cover how to connect to an exchange, get price data, and use a trading indicator to interpret that data. The next blog post will focus on adding a notification system, followed by a guide on executing trades based on the trading indicator.
There are many forms of trading, each presenting unique opportunities and challenges. One question can be “What to trade?”. Here we have, for example, equities, commodities, currencies and crypto currencies. Then we may ask “How frequently?” and come out with scalping, day-trading, swing trading, positional trading.

  Indentation with Spaces




Level: Recommendation
Description: Use spaces for indentation. It is recommended to use two spaces in most cases and four spaces for indentation caused by line breaks. Do not use the Tab character. Almost all IDEs and code editors support configuring the Tab key to automatically expand to two spaces. Configure your code editor to use spaces for indentation.


Positive Example:




class DataSource {
  id: number = 0;
  title: string = '';
  content: string = '';
}

const dataSource: DataSource[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Title 1',
    content: 'Content 1'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Title 2',
    content: 'Content 2'
  }
];

We also wanted information on some applications that were xcopy deployed on the servers. We also needed information about the patches installed on Oracle instances.

Working with binary trees can be exciting, especially when you encounter traversal problems that require a little twist.

One such problem is Zigzag Level Order Traversal, where you don’t simply traverse each level from left to right—you need to alternate directions on each level.
In this post, I’ll walk you through the solution using Java, provide step-by-step explanations, and share some helpful insights to make the concept stick.
The task is to traverse a binary tree level by level, but the direction switches at each level.
First level: left to right
Second level: right to left
Third level: left to right
And so on…
This creates a zigzag or spiral-like pattern.
Given the following tree:

By dragging pre-built connectors onto a canvas, teams can automate tasks like service provisioning, alarm handling, and firmware rollouts in hours instead of weeks. This Q&A guide explains what no-code OSS use cases are, why they matter, and how to identify your first high-impact workflow.
A no-code OSS use case is any operational scenario, such as provisioning broadband, managing alarms, or rolling out firmware, configured entirely through a drag-and-drop interface. Instead of writing scripts, you pick from pre-built connectors (CRM, inventory, NMS/EMS) and draw the logic on a canvas. The platform generates all API calls and business rules automatically.
