Failed to extract text from the file
Failed to save entity
And so on...
But what exactly led to failing of an entire high-level operation?
We don't know the answer because we didn't do a good enough job to preserve the error context, when throwing a specific error that is a symptom of a more low level cause.
For years, JavaScript developers have struggled to preserve appropriate error context when throwing exceptions, as there was no in-built mechanism provided by the language to attach error cause, unlike other languages like Java, Python and C#.
This problem was solved by Node, when they finally added a cause property to their Error constructor in v16.9.0, which means you could now throw exceptions like so:

Association Accessors:
Direct Associations: belongs_to
default is opposite: belongs_to adds an automatic validation to foreign key columns enforcing the presence of a valid value unless you explicitly add the option optional: true.
So: if you decided to remove the null: false database constraint from any of your foreign key columns in the migration file (e.g., change t.references :recipient, null: false ... to t.references :recipient, null: true ...), then you should also add the optional: true option to the corresponding belongs_to association accessor.
So remember — if you’re ever in the situation of:    
you’re trying to save a record
the save is failing
you’re doing the standard debugging technique of printing out zebra.errors.full_messages

you’re seeing an inexplicable validation error message saying that a foreign key column is blank
now you know where the validation is coming from: belongs_to adds it automatically
so figure out why you’re not providing a valid foreign key (usually it is because the parent object failed to save for its own validation reasons)
Direct associations: has_many
belongs_to, there should be an inverse has_many. Check to make sure you have all of these inverse 1-N associations.

What’s even better is that it is optimized for cloud environments, including features like fast startup times, low memory footprints, and support for both imperative and reactive programming models.
Like before, the key to success is how quickly we can go from idea to reality. In this case, let’s see how quickly I can establish a new API using Quarkus and deploy it to the cloud.

In modern React development, handling events is a foundational skill for building responsive, data-driven interfaces. Whether you’re crafting a dynamic form or building reusable components, knowing how to manage events efficiently can make your code simpler, more readable, and more performant.
Today, we’ll break down a deceptively simple difference that many React devs gloss over:
onChange={handleChange}

vs
onChange={(e) => handleChange(e)}

At first glance, both seem to do the same thing—pass the event to a handler. But there are subtle differences that matter in real-world apps. Let's explore them together.

Since 2020, Web Dev Path has been building a supportive, hands-on community where entry-level tech professionals grow through real experience. Now, we’re stepping into our next phase: onboarding web projects from Canadian small businesses and non-profits that are willing to fund development costs while supporting community learning.
In the last month, we have onboarded four scrum masters and project mangers. Now we are looking for two UI/UX designers to join our team! If you're interested, please send us a message on our website - www.webdevpath.co. Be sure to include your LinkedIn profile and a short introduction so we can schedule a meeting with you!
We have started planning to migrate our website from JavaScript to TypeScript. This will happen in stages:
Upgrade all packages


This includes upgrading Next.js to version 15, React to v19, and we will also have to upgrade Node.js version on Netlify. 
Setup Typescript Support


Following the Typescript Migration Guide, we will set up the project in a way that it supports both TypeScript and JavaScript files during the transition phase. All new pages and components will be made with typescript while we gradually migrate old JavaScript files to TypeScript.
We have completed the migration to styled-components on our website in 2023. Recently, styled-components announced that they are entering maintenance mode. We had a discussion as to whether we have to move away from styled-components. 
We believe it might be something we eventually need to do, but there is no immediate need to move away from it. In the next few months, we will investigate alternatives to styled-components, and develop a strategy for the migration.]]></summary>

A Design Sprint is basically a super-focused, time-boxed process for solving big problems and testing new ideas quickly. It's like condensing months of work into a single week. Think of it as a pressure cooker for innovation. It's not always easy, but it's almost always worth it.

Texas House passes strategic Bitcoin reserve bill
The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21, a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto.
SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion …]]></summary>

In a May 21 notice, Johnson said she planned to step down from the CFTC “later this year,” having completed her term, which ended in April. The commissioner filling a Democratic seat at the financial regulator had served since March 2022 after being nominated by former President Joe Biden.
In her farewell message, Johnson cited her work as a sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, which dealt with “nascent issues that arise with the introduction of decentralized financial products such as digital assets or cryptocurrency and other emerging markets.”

According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. 
The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.
The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

Latest in a line of crypto execs facing criminal charges
At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

Bitcoin made a new all-time high, but the bulls will have to sustain the higher levels for the momentum to pick up.

There are some murmurs among analysts about a bearish divergence, leading to a double-top pattern. However, private wealth manager Swissblock Technologies said in a post on X that its Bitcoin Fundamental In…]]></summary>

The event’s attendees are said to have collectively spent over $100 million for the chance to meet with the US president.
Since Trump’s memecoin project, Official Trump (TRUMP), announced that its top 220 tokenholders would have an opportunity to apply for an exclusive dinner with the president, many leaders in the crypto industry and US lawmakers have criticized the event, saying Trump was opening his office to potential bribery and corruption.

SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…]]></summary>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024.

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether's recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It's a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.
