The Node.js team just released Node.js 24 with significant updates and new features. Over the years, Node.js has become known for its dependence on third-party libraries for executing most of its tasks, from TypeScript support to testing to environment variable handling. 
Node.js 24 ships with native features that improve developer experience, security, and reduce dependency overhead. You can check out our general overview of the Node.js 24 release here. But the subtlety of some of these new features is something I’m concerned many developers will miss. 
In this tutorial, we’ll explore 10 Node.js features you might not be using yet — but absolutely should be. The good news is that from October 2025 onward, Node.js 24 becomes a Long-Term Support (LTS) release_._ A…]]></summary>

Whether you're crafting indie films, high-impact branded content, or elevating your YouTube visuals, this compact powerhouse is making waves for all the right reasons. Let's dig into why creators—from drone operators to docu-style shooters—are falling hard for this camera.
First things first: don’t judge the RED KOMODO-X by its size. Sure, it looks like a compact camera, but under the hood, it's got serious muscle. This beast captures pristine 6K footage with a Super 35 global shutter sensor—a huge leap forward for filmmakers tired of the jello effect caused by rolling shutters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're using Tailwind CSS with Next.js or other modern frameworks, you've likely come across directives like @layer base, @layer components, and @layer utilities. But what's the difference between them, and how should they be used?

This article explains each of them with practical examples to help you better structure your styles using Tailwind.
@layer base



For global resets and initial styles
This is the first layer loaded. Ideal for:
Resetting styles
Setting global fonts
Basic element styles like body, h1, button, etc.




@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900;
  }

  body {
     @apply bg-background text-foreground font-sans;
  }
}

@layer components



For reusable components (buttons, cards, badges, etc.)
Loaded after base and before utilities. Perfect for blocks of combined utility classes:
@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-md;
  }

  .card {
    @apply shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 bg-white;
  }
}

@layer utilities



For custom utilities
The last layer to load. Best used for specific, override-style utilities:
@layer utilities {
  .text-shadow {
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }

  .scrollbar-none {
    scrollbar-width: none;
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
  }
}

@layer base        <- Global styles
@layer components  <- Reusable components
@layer utilities   <- Specific utilities (highest priority)

Use each like this:
base: for tag resets and global defaults
components: for .btn, .card, .input, etc.
utilities: for .text-shadow, .scroll-smooth, etc.
@layer components {
  .promo-price {
    @apply text-purple-600 font-bold;
  }

  .add-button {
    @apply px-4 py-1 bg-gray-200 rounded text-sm font-medium;
  }
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Angular's default style encapsulation prevents styles from leaking into or out of components. But sometimes, you want your component to adapt based on context provided by external elements, such as a dark class on the <body> element. This is where :host-context() comes in.
:host-context()?


The :host-context() pseudo-class in Angular allows a component’s style to react to ancestor elements outside the component’s view encapsulation boundary.
It checks if the component is rendered inside an element matching the selector.
:host-context(body.dark) {
  .container {
    background-color: #222;
    color: white;
  }
}

This means: "Apply this style if the component is somewhere inside a <body class='dark'>."
Theming (e.g. light/dark mode)
Reacting to global classes or layout wrappers
Making components context-aware
✅ :host-context() checks up the DOM tree, not down.
✅ It works with Angular's default ViewEncapsulation.Emulated.
❌ It does not work with ShadowDom encapsulation.
❌ Do not repeat the context selector inside the rule block.
:host {
  .container {
    background: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

:host-context(body.dark) {
  .container {
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

// ❌ Incorrect
:host-context(body.dark) {
  .dark {
    background: black;
  }
}

This is wrong because .dark is already in the selector. You don't need to repeat it.
Use :host-context() to style Angular components based on their ancestors, such as when a global dark class is added to the <body> tag. It’s a powerful tool to make your components responsive to global layout or theming changes.]]></summary>

We at Ducky.ai noticed a strange thing has happened in software development, we’re no longer writing code in the traditional sense. Instead, we describe what we want and ask the machine to write the first draft. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit, and Devin have changed what it means to build. The keyboard isn’t gone, but it’s quieter. Developers are prompting, guiding, reviewing. Code appears in response to our intent.
This isn’t a distant future. It’s happening now. Describe a function in a comment and Copilot autocompletes it. Open a new file in Cursor and ask for a feature, and it drafts the architecture across files. The role of a developer is less that of a typist, but more akin to a curator or conductor.

Bitcoin futures flip bearish with a 43% decline in perpetual CVD.

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

“A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price,” the report states.
Investors who don’t understand the importance of a firm’s net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure” on a position that doesn’t provide additional upside leverage, the report adds.

The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.

Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.

French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
