An HTML List allows you to organize data on web pages into an ordered or unordered format to make the information easier to read and visually appealing. HTML Lists are very helpful for creating structured, accessible content in web development.Types of HTML Lists
There are three main types of lists in HTML:
1.Unordered Lists: These lists are used for items that do not need to be in any specific order. The list items are typically marked with bullets.
2.Ordered Lists: These lists are used when the order of the items is important. Each item in an ordered list is typically marked with numbers or letters.
3.Description Lists: These lists are used to contain terms and their corresponding descriptions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adobe’s Photoshop Beta is finally here for Android—and it’s packing real power. Whether you are a creative pro or just love editing photos for fun, this release gives you some of the best tools from the desktop app... right in your pocket.
And yes, it’s totally free (for now).
This isn’t a gimmick. Adobe has included real, pro-level tools like:
Core Tools: Layers, masks, selections, Spot Healing Brush, Clone Stamp, and adjustment layers
AI-Powered Generative Fill: Replace or create content with a few simple prompts, powered by Adobe Firefly
Mobile-First UX: Built for phones and small screens, not just shrunk from desktop
Guided Tutorials: Great for newbies or pros shifting from desktop to mobile
Free Access: Requires Android 11+ and 6GB+ RAM
It’s beta, so some rough edges are expected. But these are worth noting:
Portrait-Only Mode: No landscape support—annoying on tablets
Device Restrictions: Some high-end Androids (like the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra) aren’t compatible
Missing Desktop Tools: No RAW editing, pen tool, smart objects, or full color grading yet
Beta Duration? No Idea. Adobe hasn’t said how long this free phase will last
Future Pricing: $7.99/month or $69.99/year, but Adobe hasn’t shared what stays free
There’s real excitement—especially about the AI magic like Generative Fill. But some Android users are frustrated by:
Lack of feature parity with iOS


Portrait-only mode on tablets


No clear roadmap from Adobe
This Android beta is a big move—finally bringing Photoshop to mobile-first creators with serious editing power. It’s not perfect, but it’s promising.
If you’re into photo editing on Android, give it a shot. But keep your expectations grounded—it’s still a beta, and clearly a work in progress.
Want the full scoop? Check out the full article → Photoshop Beta on Android
What do you think—does it deliver, or are the missing features a dealbreaker?

Enter Node.js Clustering — a simple but powerful way to scale your app horizontally on a single machine by forking multiple processes that share the same server port.
Before we dive deeper, it helps to understand a key part of Node’s architecture:

Rubber Duck Debugging is a classic technique where you explain your code, line by line, to a rubber duck or any inanimate object. The act of verbalizing the problem forces you to slow down, rethink your assumptions, and often reveals the solution.
The term comes from a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas, where a programmer carries around a rubber duck and debugs by explaining their code to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 
Amazon Q CLI. In this blog post, I'll walk you through everything you need to create your own version of the game, including setup, game mechanics, and running the project on Windows.
Install Python(if you don’t have it already):
python.org and make sure to check the box to add Python to your system’s PATH during installation.
Install AWS CLI using pip:
pip install awscli

Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:
aws configure

You’ll need to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which you can get from the AWS Console.
Install Amazon Q CLI:
pip install amazon-q-cli

Verify the installation:
q --version

Start Amazon Q CLI by running:
q chat

In the chat, ask:
Can you help me make a Flappy Bird game using Pygame?
I wanted my Flappy Bird clone to have the following features:
Menu State: A welcoming main menu where the player can start the game.
Playing State: The player controls the bird’s jump.
Result State: When the game ends, the player can restart.
Let’s talk about how the game works under the hood:
Bird Movement: The bird continuously falls due to gravity, but when the player presses Space, the bird jumps!
Pipe Generation: Pipes randomly appear from the right side and move leftward at a constant speed.
Collision Detection: The bird collides with pipes or the ceiling/floor, ending the game if either happens.
Now, let’s get this game up and running. Here’s how you can set up the game on your own machine:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/afnank070/flappy-bird-amazon-q-cli

Navigate to the Project Folder:
cd flappy-bird-python

Install Pygame:
pip install pygame

Run the Game:
flappy_bird.py

Final Thoughts
Building this game was an absolute blast! Amazon Q CLI really sped up the development process.
If you're new to game development or want to make your own version of Flappy Bird, I highly recommend giving this a try.]]></summary>

This guide is perfect for beginners using AWS Free Tier who want to deploy a simple web server manually.
Prerequisites
✅ A valid AWS Free Tier account.
✅ Git Bash installed on your local machine (Windows).
✅ Basic understanding of web servers and SSH.
Step 1: Log In to the AWS Management Console
First, we need to log in to our AWS account.
Open your web browser and go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
Enter your login credentials and sign in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow developers, we need to talk about tutorial hell.
Not the coding kind - the entrepreneurship kind.
I've spent 3 months in startup tutorial hell. Every framework, every methodology, every 'proven system' for building a business. I could probably teach a course on startup theory at this point.
But theory doesn't ship products. Theory doesn't get customers. Theory doesn't generate revenue.
So today I'm switching from learning to building. One roadmap, one focus, public accountability.
This isn't another 'follow my journey' post. This is documentation for my future self and anyone else stuck in the same cycle.
The plan: build something, measure what matters, iterate based on real feedback from real users.
Revolutionary, I know.
First commit coming tomorrow. Time to write some code that actually solves a problem instead of just following along with tutorials.
Who's with me?]]></summary>
