Wild, right?
But it happens all the time.
Someone makes a tiny assumption in a planning session.
A Jira ticket doesn’t get enough context.
No one questions the edge cases.
And then… that “minor” detail shows up in prod.
Now it’s a full-blown issue, breaking user flows, burning dev hours, and dragging in the whole team for an emergency fix.
By the time it’s caught, it’s not just a bug. It’s a cost center.
Not just for engineering, but for support, for ops, for customer trust.
Planning isn’t just about timelines.
It’s your first and best chance to save your team from costly mistakes down the road.
So you better do it right.
The earlier you catch the gaps, the cheaper they are.
And the less your engineers want to scream into a pillow 😅]]></summary>

Hey DEV community! 
We all love that feeling of building something new – a side project, a small tool, maybe the beginnings of a startup. docker-compose up hums along perfectly on our local machine, and life is good.
Then comes the moment we want to share it with the world, or even just access it reliably ourselves: deployment. For me, this was often where the fun slowed down and the headaches began.
When it's time to move beyond localhost, we typically look at a few routes:
Examples: Heroku, Render, Fly.io, Netlify
Pros:
Simplicity — often just a git push to production
Handles infra, basic scaling, and boilerplate
Cons:
Can get expensive as you grow
Limited control
May not support complex Docker Compose setups
Examples: DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzn…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern application development involves handling sensitive credentials—API keys, database passwords, encryption keys, cloud tokens, and more. Traditionally, many engineering teams manage these secrets using .env files checked into CI/CD pipelines or shared manually across environments. While easy to set up, this approach creates serious security and operational risks.

Vault, particularly HashiCorp Vault, is a robust solution to this problem. It provides a central, secure, and auditable system for managing secrets using pluggable secret engines and dynamic access controls. Vault has been widely adopted across industries for securing configurations in both small projects and large enterprise systems.

While .env files are convenient for development, they come with major limitations:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Dev Community! 
I'm Steve, an indie dev who loves building things and finding smarter ways to ship ideas fast. Lately, I've been diving deep into the no-code space — not just as a developer, but as a curious builder exploring what’s possible without writing a single line of code.
To make sense of it all (and help others too), I started a GitHub repo:
👉 Awesome No-Code Tools
It's a curated collection of the 100+ best no-code tools in 2025, organized by category, use case, and platform. If you're launching a startup, prototyping an idea, or just curious — there's something here for you.
Some categories include:
Website & App Builders
Automation Tools
AI-Powered No-Code
Databases 
VR
...and more being added regularly!
While I still write code daily, I see no-code as an accelerator — a way to validate ideas, save time, and help non-developers to vibe code. The line between "developer" and "builder" is blurring, and that’s exciting.
If you know a killer tool that deserves to be on the list, feel free to:
Open a pull request

Drop a suggestion in issues



Community-curated = community strong 💪
I’d love to hear what no-code tools you can’t live without in 2025. Drop a comment below or star the repo if you find it helpful 🌟]]></summary>
