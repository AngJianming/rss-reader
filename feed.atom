The @PropertySource annotation is used to tell Spring to load a specific properties file from a location provided in the annotation. It is used in conjunction with @Configuration at the class level. It allows you, as a developer, to externalize the configuration of your application.
@PropertySource?



It allows you to load properties files from any location.
In Java 8+, you can repeat this annotation many times, allowing you to load multiple configuration files.
It supports the usage of placeholders using Spring Expression Language syntax.
You can handle missing files by ignoring them if they are not found.
Property override: if you have many properties with the same name, the last definition will override the first one.

Then I introduced you to progressive web apps (read about it below).
Now i can make Apps with zero money. 
Thanks GOD
Story


My semester breaks are going on and I decided to do something productive so participated in an hackathon. It was about spreading awareness about finance and economy. Thought finance is always boring what if i can create an app where people can learn in fun way So let me introduce you to FinLingo financial quiz app. Simple but effective. 
Tech Stack i used:
PWA (progressive web apps) : applications that you build by using web technologies, and that can be installed and can run on all devices, from one codebase. PWAs provide native-like experiences to your users on supporting devices.


In short you can build an APP at once and can be used in any platforms (mac, linux, windows, Android, ios). Also no need to worry about publishing fee (It's completely free).


Next.js : For both frontend + Backend. It can be use for full-stack development. SEO friendly.


Supabase : To Store my app data. An SQL database. 



This is how i created my first App for free and you can do the same.
