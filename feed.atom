Whether you're brand new to coding or coming back after a break, it's tempting to lean on AI tools like ChatGPT, Windsurf, or Cursor to fill in the gaps. But here's the truth:
AI can help ‚Äî but it can't do the learning for you.
This post breaks down:
What AI tools are actually good at when you're learning
Where they fall flat (and why it's not their fault)
How to use AI without losing grip on the fundamentals
Why "knowing what to ask" is just as important as knowing how to code
‚ö†Ô∏è If you're just starting out, this is the real-world reality check you didn‚Äôt know you needed.

  Introduction


JavaScript, as one of the most ubiquitous programming languages, primarily serves as the backbone of web applications. Though much attention is paid to the language's syntax and semantics, fewer discussions delve into the subtleties that power the JavaScript engine and its internal mechanics. Among these intricacies are the concepts of internal slots, a cornerstone of how JavaScript manages data structures, privacy, and encapsulation. This article endeavors to furnish a detailed exploration of internal slots, their historical context, practical applications, performance implications, and advanced debugging techniques.
The term "internal slots" originates from the ECMAScript specification, specifically as a mean‚Ä¶]]></summary>

I'm perpetually drowning in open tabs. Yes, I do need Bluesky, ChatGPT, Claude, Goose, Cursor, Discord, Slack, Netflix, and Google Docs all open at the same time. I've learned that tab management isn't my only vice.
"Hi, my name is Rizel, and I'm a localhost ports hoarder. üëãüèø"
It always starts innocently with me running one project that uses localhost:3000. Then a teammate pings me to review their PR. Their project also runs on localhost:3000. Fortunately, modern frameworks are smart enough to automatically bump to ports 3001 or 3002. Before I know it, 3003, 3004, and 3005 are running too, and my laptop sounds like it‚Äôs about to take off as it crawls under the weight of too many processes.
Typically, freeing up ports involves running the following commands:

After years of development, Tailwind CSS v4.0 has finally landed, and it's a complete game-changer. Having worked with Tailwind since its early days, I can confidently say this is the most significant update we've seen. The performance improvements alone are worth the upgrade, but there's so much more.
In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through everything you need to know about migrating from v3 to v4, including the challenges I encountered, solutions to common problems, and my honest thoughts on what this means for your development workflow.
Before diving into the migration process, let me share why this upgrade is worth your time. After testing v4.0 on several production projects, the benefits are undeniable:

This inherent complexity brings with it a constant and often underestimated challenge: error handling.
In my years of experience, I‚Äôve seen how poor error handling can crush the user experience (UX), hinder the traceability of problems, and not less important, affect the developer experience (DX).
What happens when your application can't get data from the server? The possibilities are endless: an internal server error (5xx)? An authorization problem (4xx)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Solana‚Äôs bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Kr√ºger noted that ‚Äúthis is the least euphoric new all-time highs‚Äù for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump‚Äôs aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones.¬†

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians‚Äô ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC‚Äôs rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a ‚Äúbull flag‚Äù triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000.¬†
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on¬†May 21.¬†

In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as ‚Äúsub-class B‚Äù) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV‚Äôs hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance‚Äôs delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV‚Äôs potential rise to a ‚Äútop-tier cryptocurrency‚Äù like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn‚Äôt need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings?

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity.¬†
But what‚Äôs the goal?¬†
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It‚Äôs not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs critical to learn how to spot the signs early.
