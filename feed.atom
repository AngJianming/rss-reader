  SQL(Structured Query Language)


SQL is a database that stores data in a vertical way. In SQL databases, you store data in the form of row and columns. The first row contains fields, and the next row contain data for those fields. So it's like adding data vertically.
SQL is mostly used in applications where you already know the structure of the data before storing it. For example, if you want to store user data or banking data, you can use a SQL database.
NoSQL is a database that stores data in horizontal way. In this, data is stored in JSON format, and you can have as many fields as you want. It is generally faster compared to SQL.
When you have dynamic data with multiple fields, you use a NoSQL database. For example, when storing product dat…]]></summary>

You can install globally using your favorite package manager:
npm install -g drizzle-setup
# or use npx for one-time setup
npx drizzle-setup

In your project root, run:
drizzle-setup

You’ll be guided through:
Selecting a database (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)


Choosing a preset config


Setting the target folder


Copying boilerplate files


Generating drizzle.config.ts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a core practice in modern DevOps workflows. While GitHub Actions provides powerful cloud-hosted runners, sometimes you need more control over the build environment — for cost savings, performance, or custom setups.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through setting up a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner on an AWS EC2 instance, and then use it to deploy a simple Node.js app automatically. You’ll learn how to:
Launch and configure an EC2 instance


Register it as a GitHub self-hosted runner


Set up a secure deployment pipeline



By the end, you’ll have a working CI/CD system running on your own AWS infrastructure.
✅ 1. Prerequisites
AWS account


GitHub account


Basic knowledge of Node.js & Linux


SSH key setup




✅ 2. Launching and Preparing the EC2 Instance
Choose Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu


Configure instance (t2.micro for testing)


Open required ports (e.g., SSH, app port)


SSH into EC2 and install:
First update EC2 sudo apt update

Install Docker sudo apt-get install docker.io -y









✅ 3. Installing and Registering GitHub Self-Hosted Runner
Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Actions → Runners


Choose Linux x64


Download and configure the runner on EC2




✅ 4. Setting Up the CI/CD Workflow
Add at root level of your project.github/workflows/deploy.yml


Refer this repo for yml file GitHub




✅ 5. Testing and Verifying Deployment
Push code to main branch


Watch self-hosted runner logs


Check if app is running (via browser or curl)




✅ 6. Troubleshooting Tips
Open the required ports in AWS security group
✅ 7. Conclusion
What you’ve accomplished:
EC2 instance as GitHub runner
CI/CD using your infrastructure
Benefits of self-hosted vs GitHub-hosted runners
Scale to multiple EC2 runners
Add database integration
✅ 8. Resources & Links
