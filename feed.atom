        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain analysis company Arham Intelligence claims to have uncovered previously undisclosed wallet addresses tied to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially exposing billions in Bitcoin holdings. 
In a post referencing Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor’s commitment to privacy, Arkham claimed that it had identified an extra 70,816 BTC linked to the company. At current prices, the stash is valued at about $7.6 billion.
Arkham said the newly identified wallets bring Strategy’s total holdings to $54.5 billion. If accurate, the findings suggest that Arkham has mapped out most of the company’s stash, making it the first entity to publicly associate the wallets with the firm. 
“Saylor said he would never reveal his addresses. So, we did,” Arkham wrote, adding tha…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔵 Local Variable:



A local variable is declared inside a function.
    It can only be used within that function (not outside).
function greet() {
greet();
 A global variable is declared outside any function.
    It can be accessed from anywhere in the code (inside or outside functions).
let globalVar = "I'm global!";
function sayHello() {
sayHello();
In HTML, you can link or write JavaScript in three ways: inline, internal, and external. Here's a clear explanation with examples for each:
✅ 1. Inline JavaScript
JavaScript is written directly inside an HTML tag's attribute, like onclick.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="alert('Hello from inline JS!')">Click Me</button>

</body>
</html>


📝 Use for: Very short scripts or event handlers.
✅ 2. Internal JavaScript
JavaScript is written inside a  tag within the HTML file.</p>

<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>
<html><br>
<head><br>
  <title>Internal JS Example</title><br>
  <script><br>
    function sayHello() {<br>
      alert(&quot;Hello from internal JS!&quot;);<br>
    }<br>

Exponential Backoff — a proven algorithm for handling retries efficiently and politely.
APIs can fail for many transient reasons:
🌐 Network timeouts
📶 Temporary internet issues
🚦 Rate limiting (429 Too Many Requests)
🔧 Server-side overload (5xx errors)
In many of these cases, retrying the request after a delay can succeed.
Imagine if every client instantly retried after failure — the server would be flooded, making recovery even harder.
So we need to retry smarter — not harder.

I'm excited to share my latest project with you: AutoGit-o-Matic (https://github.com/FPGArtktic/AutoGit-o-Matic). It's a straightforward yet powerful tool designed to automate core Git operations in your local repositories. I originally built this software for my own needs, stemming from two key scenarios.
The Genesis of AutoGit-o-Matic
Key Benefits and Use Cases:
Simple Project Backup for Small Businesses/Teams: For small businesses, freelancers, or compact teams without a centralized CI/CD system, AutoGit-o-Matic can serve as a simple and effective tool for automatically fetching the latest changes from your remote repository. This ensures everyone is working with the most current version of the code, minimizing the risk of data loss and streamlining collaboration.
How It Works:

Today I’m launching something that’s been close to my heart for a long time:
👉 Campfires.dev – a platform to help developers grow beyond writing code.
Over the years, I’ve spoken to many developers who feel stuck. Ranging from beginners to seniors, I've seen a common pattern. They want to:
Make more impact on their team
Communicate better with stakeholders
Grow their confidence
Or just figure out: what’s my next step?
I’ve been there myself and I know how overwhelming and lonely that path can feel.
That’s why I created Campfires.dev: to offer the guidance I wish I had.
Campfires.dev is here to support your career growth with:
👥 Group sessions: Live Q&As, workshops, and peer discussions
1-on-1 Coaching: Personal guidance tailored to your growth goals
If you’re a developer who wants to:
grow into a senior or lead role
make a real difference in your team
or just gain more clarity and confidence
Campfires.dev was made for you!
“I want to grow, but I don’t know what to focus on.”
“I’m confident with code, but I struggle with soft skills.”
“I feel stuck in a mid-level role.”
I truly believe career growth shouldn’t be a solo journey. Let’s learn, grow, and light the way forward: together.
Check it out here 👉 campfires.dev 
I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or questions!

If you're a product person, you know what it means to refactor your code. It's essential for shipping features faster, testing more effectively, and maintaining your codebase over time.
You'll lose at least a month and a half to refactor a decent-sized codebase, but it's worth doing while things are still manageable... before you end up rewriting everything from scratch.
Most startups rewrite everything because it feels easier than refactoring. But if you can afford a couple of months, it's a great opportunity to clear out some technical debt... because unfortunately, debt always needs to be repaid at some point.
What’s your take on refactoring? Drop it below!]]></summary>

Under the terms, Evo Fund is entitled to early redemption by giving at least five business days’ notice. The bonds can be redeemed in full or in part, in multiples of $525,000.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
The May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.
Instead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. 
“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.
The letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.
Favorable regulatory environment
The SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.
Atkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.

The following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.
In a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.

“We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.

“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. 
The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.
Court “blows a hole in trade talks”
Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”

The strength of Bitcoin’s (BTC) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. 
“This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.”

Musk confirmed his exit in a May 29 X post, thanking President Donald Trump “for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.” Reuters reported that a White House official said his “off-boarding will begin tonight.”
Musk told The Washington Post for a May 27 report that the “federal bureaucracy situation is much worse” than he expected, and it was “an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”

K33 said on May 28 that it secured financing through convertible loans and a new issue of shares and warrants, which “will be used in full to acquire Bitcoin in order to establish the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.”
Warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000.

In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview, Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities.
“If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. 
He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator.

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²=0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key point:

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cork Protocol, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, was hit by a smart contract exploit on May 28, resulting in the loss of roughly $12 million in digital assets.
Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.
The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot
A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …]]></summary>
