What if your web app changed itself as people used it?
That was the thought that grabbed me like a virus.
We’ve built responsive sites. We've built adaptive UIs. But what if your backend evolved over time — like a living organism?
So I built a Flask app that mutates its own behavior based on how users interact with it.
Not AI. Not random. Evolution, guided by real user behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not every project in coding starts with a grand vision. Sometimes, the most useful tools are born out of pure necessity.
I was deep into developing a mocktail recipe website, fine-tuning backends, and enjoying the creativity behind it (not so fun at times, but still fulfilling). After all, what is fun when life can be boring? Then reality hit — how do I track and bill for all this work?
Traditional invoicing tools felt like overkill. Spreadsheets? A nightmare. Existing platforms? Complicated. I needed something simple, something mine.
My solution? A bare-bones TypeScript API that does exactly what I need:
interface Invoice {
  id: string;
  clientName: string;
  items: WorkItem[];
  total: number;
  status: 'draft' | 'sent' | 'paid';
}

interface WorkItem {
  description: string;
  hours: number;
  rate: number;
}

Simplicity is Power: Complex doesn't mean better.
TypeScript Brings Structure: Catch errors before they happen.
Solve Your Own Problem First: The best projects start with personal pain points.
router.post('/invoices', (req, res) => {
  const invoice = {
    id: generateUniqueId(),
    ...req.body,
    total: calculateTotal(req.body.items),
    status: 'draft'
  };

  saveInvoice(invoice);
  res.status(201).json(invoice);
});

Freelancers tired of invoice chaos.
Developers looking for a practical project.
Anyone wanting to understand API design.
This isn't just about invoices. It's about building tools that solve real problems, learning in the process, and creating something genuinely useful.
Pro Tip: Your most valuable projects often start with a personal itch to solve something.
Happy coding, and may your invoices be as clean as your code! 🚀]]></summary>

The Shopify GraphQL documentation can be a lot to get to grips with, even if you adopt an approach I recommend.
So what can make it easier for us, especially keeping up to date with the new versions and changes...
Linting!
This linting is designed to work with eslint, which is very commonly used in the JavaScript world.
To use this you should have an eslint.config.js file.
Building ontop of the great work by @graphql-eslint/eslint-plugin, I've created a new eslint plugin to add some Shopify GraphQL specific best practices!
This means you can check your GraphQL for unknown fields, deprecations when migrating between versions and best practices around mutations and pagination for example.
The linters work best combined with knowledge about Shopify GraphQL Schema.

TypeScript is a powerful programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static types (which specify the shape and behavior of your variables and objects). It enables developers to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, making applications more robust, predictable, and maintainable. Static typing is one of the key aspects of TypeScript, making it easier to understand what your code is expected to do—and how it behaves under specific conditions.

TypeScript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds static typing (checking variable types at compile time) to the language. It enables developers to catch errors before runtime, boosts productivity with type definitions, and improves code readability. A "type" in TypeScript describes the kind of value a variable can hold, such as numbers, strings, arrays, objects, or even more complex, custom-defined structures. Static typing allows developers to define these types, which can help prevent unexpected errors in codebases. Whether you're a seasoned coder or just learning, TypeScript makes it easier to write robust, maintainable applications.

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings strict type-checking to the language. By introducing types into JavaScript, TypeScript provides developers with a powerful tool to write safer, more robust, and maintainable code. In TypeScript, types serve as a constraint mechanism to ensure that variables, functions, and objects adhere to the expected structure.

Bitcoin price saw profit booking near $105,819, signaling that bears remain active at higher levels.

Select altcoins have continued to move higher, indicating increased investor interest.  

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

In a May 12 press conference at Gracie Mansion, the city’s official mayoral residence, Adams said June Ou, founder of financial services company Figure, and Richie Hecker, CEO of private equity firm Traction and Scale, would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts. He spoke of Ou and Hecker acting as advisers for New York City’s next steps in “economic development and opportunities to serve the public using digital assets.” 
“We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding:

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. 
Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lap via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.
