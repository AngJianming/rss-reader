        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After receiving JSON from RESTful services, further calculations are often required. Processing such data in Java is cumbersome. In contrast, esProc simplifies this significantly, as it can connect to RESTful interfaces, excels at processing multi-layered data, and can be embedded in Java applications as an in-application computing engine.
First, download esProc Standard Edition ，It's free.
After installation, try accessing RESTful data.

If you're reading this, you may already be interested in learning Rust. However, if not, I understand you. I am also very skeptical about learning new technologies. But I am here to try to change your mind. 
Here are some reasons to consider it:
Performance: The main reason Rust has become popular is that it is designed to be fast and efficient. This makes it an excellent choice for performance-critical applications. It can often match (or exceed) the performance of C and C++ while providing additional safety features. I believe it strikes a good balance between performance and safety.


Memory Safety: Rust is designed to be memory-safe. This helps avoid common programming errors like null pointer de…]]></summary>

But here’s the kicker: what you’ve built is just a facade — a beautiful, interactive shell that anyone else could replicate in 15 minutes. It’s like building a cardboard castle: impressive at first glance, but not exactly livable.
So, how do you transition from a flashy UI to a real, value-delivering product?
Let’s dive into the three pillars with practical exmples that make the difference:
1. Define Your Target Audience and Their Problem
Who you’re building for.
2. BI: Not Just Business Intelligence — It’s Builder’s Intelligence!
What users are doing on your platform.

Watching our users sessions in posthog
What are users doing on my website?
It’s like having a magnifying glass for your product’s user experience.

3. Automate or Die (Of Exhaustion)
Automation is your lifeboat.
By automating operations around your product, you can save hours of manual work. Think:
Sending welcome emails to new users.
Final Thoughts
Clearly defining your audience and their problems.
So, keep building, keep iterating, and remember: it’s not just about the code; it’s about the people who use it.]]></summary>

Introduction:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model and provision your AWS resources in a declarative manner. Instead of manually creating each resource individually, you define your desired infrastructure as code in a template, and CloudFormation handles the creation, update, and deletion.  This simplifies infrastructure management, enabling automation and repeatability.
Prerequisites:
Before using CloudFormation, you'll need an AWS account and basic familiarity with AWS services.  Understanding JSON or YAML is crucial, as these are the primary formats for CloudFormation templates.
Advantages:
Automation: Automate the creation and management of complex infrastructure.
Repeatability: Easily recreate environments consistently across different regio…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔔 What’s New?
AWS has announced that AWS Code Pipeline now supports using AWS Secrets Manager inside Commands actions!
💡 Why It Matters
Before this update, developers often:
    Hardcoded secrets into buildspec.yml
    Stored sensitive values directly in environment variables
    Used workarounds to pull secrets via scripts
This was risky and error-prone.
Now, you can pass secrets securely and natively using Secrets Manager — no more secrets in plain text!
✅ Real-World Example: Use GitHub Token Securely
Imagine you need to clone a private GitHub repo inside your pipeline.
🔐 Step 1: Store the GitHub token in AWS Secrets Manager
Key: github-token
ARN: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123

⚙️ Step 2: Reference the secret in your Code Pipeline YAML
Actions:
  - Name: ClonePrivateRepo
    ActionTypeId:
      Category: Test
      Owner: AWS
      Provider: Commands
      Version: 1
    Configuration:
      Commands: |
        echo "Cloning repo..."
        git clone https://git:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git
      EnvironmentVariables:
        - Name: GITHUB_TOKEN
          Type: SecretsManager
          Value: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123


✅ Your GitHub token is injected securely as $GITHUB_TOKEN without ever being exposed.
📌 Key Benefits
    🔐 Improved security: No plaintext credentials in code
    ⚙️ Easier automation: Seamless secret injection in pipelines
    📉 Reduced risk: Centralized and managed secret lifecycle

Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%.

A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.
The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission has blasted her agency over its settlement letter that could finally end the Ripple legal saga. 
The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether's USDt (USDT), Circle's USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

In a May 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bond’s lawyers reiterated some of the claims Salame made in opposing his plea deal with the government, which ultimately still led to him serving time in prison. She claimed that prosecutors obtained a deal with Salame through “stealth and deception” by allegedly agreeing they would not file charges against Bond.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.
