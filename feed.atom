        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a submission for Frontend Challenge - June Celebrations, CSS Art: June Celebrations.
‎This piece is a reflection of what it means to be queer in Nigeria, a country where same-sex relationships are criminalized, and Pride isn't something you can safely celebrate in public. I wanted to capture the duality of being proud and being hidden( existing in the shadows but still burning with light).
Pride in the shadows, still we shine” is the core message. It’s a nod to queer Nigerians who, despite oppression, continue to love, resist, and shine even if only behind closed doors.
Live Demo(Preferred screen size is desktop): https://june-celebrations.vercel.app/
Github Repository: https://github.com/daluclemas/dev.to-challenge
Preview Image: 

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It was my first time experimenting with CSS art, and it pushed me to think not just like a developer, but like an artist and storyteller.
When I began, I knew I wanted to create something personal. Something that reflected my reality as a lesbian living in Nigeria. In a country where queerness is criminalised, I often find myself hiding, silencing parts of who I am to stay safe. So, I asked myself: How do I show pride when I can’t be seen? How do I celebrate when I’m forced to remain in the shadows?
The most challenging — and rewarding — part was creating the Pride flag. I had to research how to construct it using only code and how to animate it to feel alive. I also used ChatGPT as a research tool and guide.
What I’m most proud of is that I found a way to tell a story that is deeply personal, quietly radical, and honest. If I had more time, I would’ve added a silhouette of a woman waving the flag, but even without it, I believe the message shines through.
This piece is for every queer Nigerian living in silence, for everyone finding pride in private moments, and for those who still dream in full color despite the darkness.
Pride in the shadows, still we shine.]]></summary>

In this article, we introduce the steps for visualizing the operating status of NVIDIA GPUs using NVIDIA’s DCGM Exporter together with Prometheus and Grafana.
Of course, you can also monitor GPU status with the nvidia-smi command.
nvidia-smi has the following limitations:
Manual polling — you need to loop it with a shell script, for example
Difficult to centrally monitor multiple hosts — logging in to each host via SSH is cumbersome
No long‑term time‑series data — CSV logging is possible but not easy to visualize
The method presented here eliminates these drawbacks and enables centralized monitoring in Grafana.

You just built a new PC or wiped an old one, installed Windows 11, and now you’re stuck with a watermark saying Activate Windows. Microsoft wants $199 for a Windows 11 Pro key. That’s almost the price of a decent SSD. No thanks.
didn’t work:



eBay = scam city. Got a $5 key. Didn’t activate. Seller vanished.
Reddit gray market = hit or miss. One key worked, one didn’t. Not sustainable.
Random keygen sites = virus bait.
I bit the bullet and tried SFTKey. Legit key. Instant email. Activated clean. Still working weeks later. They’re not alone — other software-only retailers have similar deals.
# Assume you’ve already installed Win 11 without a key.
# Get a key from a trusted low-cost software retailer.

slmgr /ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX  # install the product key
slmgr /ato                               # activate

Retail key, not OEM or Volume MAK
Must be able to reactivate after hardware change
Good trust score, reviews, refund policy
If you’re scripting deployments or activating multiple machines, consider a legit bulk/volume deal. But for solo use, one clean Windows 11 Pro key from a verified seller is the way to go.
Use your brain, use legit sources, and stop letting that watermark haunt your dev setup.

Before I started installing it on my computer and getting stucked, I first gave a list of instructions a try in VirtualBox. I installed the base packages and a desktop environment (KDE Plasma) and it was surprisingly easy for me to get everything running. The next step was go apply this to my actual computer.
