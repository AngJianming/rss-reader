        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧠 Introduction 
So I made CypherCore — a Matrix-style puzzle game created using Python, Pygame, and Amazon Q CLI, an AI-powered coding assistant from AWS.

CypherCore isn’t just another retro game. While many rebuild classics like Pong or Tetris, I set out to create something that felt like you were diving headfirst into a digital mainframe. 
Built with Python, Pygame, and the generative power of Amazon Q CLI, CypherCore simulates hacking terminals with logic puzzles and glitch aesthetics — all made on a Hackintosh ThinkPad running macOS Monterey.
⚡️ The twist?
🎮 What Is CypherCore?
CypherCore is a puzzle game set inside a simulated mainframe. The aesthetics are straight out of 90s hacker lore: ASCII visuals, green-glow Matrix animations, glitch FX, and logic-based gameplay.

Sadly, though, it then started giving me code where I couldn’t see what it had changed. When I asked, it told me it had added a function. But that function was already there… At that point it become clear that it wasn’t going to be of any more help and I gave up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Choose boring technology.” — Dan McKinley (ex-Engineering at Etsy)
In the age of constant innovation and shiny new frameworks, it’s tempting to jump on every new tool that promises to change your dev life. But sometimes, the best tool is the one you don’t notice—because it just works.
Welcome to the case for boring tech.
Boring tech isn't bad tech. It's well-established, stable, and widely understood. It’s PostgreSQL over some NoSQL flavor-of-the-month. It’s Rails or Django over the latest JS meta-framework. It’s SSH and cron instead of a complex CI/CD toolchain you don’t understand.
Boring tech has survived years of production use. It has documentation, Stack Overflow threads, GitHub issues, and real-world success stories.
Good luck finding a dev fluent in a 3-month-old build tool. With boring tech, there’s a bigger talent pool and faster onboarding.
Shiny tools break. APIs change. Dependencies rot. Boring tech? It’s predictable—and predictability is a superpower in production.
🐘 PostgreSQL

🧱 jQuery (yes, still!)

📦 Docker

🐍 Python

🛠 Bash scripts

🔧 cron jobs

🧑‍💻 Git
None of these make headlines—but they keep the digital world running.
Of course, boring tech isn’t always the answer. Use cutting-edge tools when:
Your problem is novel or evolving fast

You're prototyping and optimizing later

You want to experiment (and accept the risks)
But in production? Simplicity scales.
Tech isn’t about what’s coolest—it’s about what delivers reliably.
If you want to ship, sleep, and scale, maybe it’s time to go back to basics.

Bitcoin’s performance in the current bull market and a new cohort of buyers reflect a maturing market and widening adoption.

A 50% rise in hashrate and a 63% jump in Realized Cap highlight investors’ confidence in Bitcoin.

A recent report from Fidelity Digital Assets explored how the current Bitcoin market cycle reflects a shift toward a maturing market where the rate of adoption deepens and expands.
At block height 892,500—marking 25% progress into the current halving epoch—Bitcoin traded between $82,500 and $85,000, representing a 31% increase from its value on April 19, 2024, when the fourth halving reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC.

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…]]></summary>

Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish

On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.
Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, on Decentralize with Cointelegraph, we break down a pivotal moment for US crypto legislation. 
In a 66–32 procedural vote on May 19, the US Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill aimed at establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.

Breaking down GENIUS
The GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.
“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week…]]></summary>

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…]]></summary>

In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. 
“This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. 
Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.

In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals.

Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.

Speaking at a panel during Dutch Blockchain Week on May 22 in Amsterdam, Bukov said traditional banks spend between $100 and $300 per user to verify documents and set up accounts. Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.
“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.”

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.
