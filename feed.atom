Especially in the React Native ecosystem, where one codebase serves two platforms—Android and iOS—robust testing practices are critical to prevent regressions, ensure smooth UI behavior, and maintain performance. In this guide, we'll explore everything from React Native unit testing to complete integration testing using the React Native Testing Library.
React Native apps are complex, with multiple moving parts: asynchronous logic, native modules, dynamic UI rendering, and device-specific behaviors. Testing helps you:
Catch bugs early before users do.
Ensure a consistent user experience across devices.
Refactor confidently with test coverage.
Integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines.
Neglecting testing can lead to app store…]]></summary>

When building APIs, it’s crucial to understand how different HTTP methods behave when the same request is sent multiple times. This concept is called idempotency — and it helps ensure your API is reliable, safe, and user-friendly.
In this blog, we’ll:
Explore which HTTP verbs are idempotent and why
Show simple Node.js/Express code examples for each verb
Explain how to handle non-idempotent requests like POST safely
Discuss ETags and caching
Understand when and how we need to implement idempotency ourselves
Let’s dive in! 🏊‍♂️
Idempotency means making the same API call multiple times results in the same effect as making it once. This prevents accidental duplicates, data corruption, or unexpected side effects.

Azure has over 60 regions worldwide, each made up of data centers and network systems. Regions are grouped by geography, like the U.S. or Europe, which sets rules for where data stays.
An Azure region consists of one or more datacenters, connected by a high-capacity, fault-tolerant, low-latency network connection. Azure datacenters are typically located within a large metropolitan area.

Every region is contained within a single geography that serves as a fixed data residency boundary. If you have data residency requirements, it's important that you select regions within the required geography. Each geography has at least one region equipped with availability zones. For a list of all Azure geographies, see Azure geographies.

In its simplest form, a virtual machine, or VM, is a digitized version of a physical computer. Virtual machines can run programs and operating systems, store data, connect to networks, and do other computing functions. However, a VM uses entirely virtual resources instead of physical components. 
VMs enable businesses to create isolated environments on host hardware that behave like separate machines. A more straightforward way to understand what a virtual machine is to think of it as a virtual computer within another computer. But instead of a physical computer like a server, laptop, or smartphone, a VM is defined by software. 
Virtual machines use virtualization technology to create virtual hardware—or a virtual version of a computer on a physical machine.…]]></summary>

RAG is an AI technique that combines two powerful components:
1.  A retriever that searches for relevant information from external sources
2.  A generator (like GPT or Claude or any other AI model) that uses that information to craft accurate, grounded responses

RAG is used in scenarios such as:
Recent data or information is required to answer a question
Information needs to be retrieved from private documents
Let’s say you ask an AI assistant:
“What’s our company’s refund policy?”
The question is converted into a vector (a list of numbers that captures the meaning)
It searches a vector database of your documents (like PDFs, FAQs, or manuals)
It retrieves the most relevant chunks of text
It inserts those chunks into the prompt sent to the language model
The model then generates an answer based on both your question and the retrieved info
1.Split Documents into Chunks (Document Chunking)
Example Chunk:
“Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days of full-time employment…”
2.Generate Embeddings (Using Embedding Model)
The more dimensions, the more nuance the vector can represent — like tone, topic, or context.
Example
Chunk vector → 0.21, -0.64, 0.48, …, 0.02
3.Store in Vector Database
Now your database can search by meaning, not just keywords.
⸻

RUNTIME (When User Asks a Question)
⸻

4.User Asks a Question
“When do I qualify for health benefits?”
5.Convert Question to a Vector (Query Embedding)
6.Semantic Search in Vector DB
Retrieved chunk:
“Employees are eligible for health benefits after 90 days…”
7.Augment the Prompt
Prompt to the foundation model:
Context:
Question:
8.Foundation Model Generates Answer
“You qualify for health benefits after 90 days of full-time employment, according to company policy.”
No fine-tuning needed: You don’t have to retrain the model
Up-to-date answers: Pull from the latest documents
Custom knowledge: Use your own files, policies, or FAQs
Fewer hallucinations: Grounded responses using real data]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s RSI has dropped 15% and is now below the overbought threshold.

Bitcoin futures flip bearish with a 43% decline in perpetual CVD.

Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as long as a key support level holds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price hit fresh all-time highs of nearly $112,000 on May 23, gaining 50% from its April 1 lows. According to analysts, BTC price is now “showing signs of easing momentum” as it consolidates. 
Bitcoin’s rally to $111K triggered buyer fatigue
BTC’s recent run to $111,000 pushed the daily relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone at 79.6. However, “signs of easing momentum” have emerged as the RSI dropped by 15% to 67, said market intelligence firm Glassnode in its latest report, adding:

According to the report, the inherent risk level of VASPs is deemed “High,” driven by factors including transaction volume, client reach, distribution channels, legal structures and the international scope of operations.
The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

Metaplanet’s stockholders are paying more than a fivefold premium on Bitcoin (BTC) when investing in the Japanese company, according to a report by 10x Research published on May 27.
“A little-known Japanese stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth $596,154, more than five times its actual price,” the report states.
Investors who don’t understand the importance of a firm’s net asset value (NAV) may be “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure” on a position that doesn’t provide additional upside leverage, the report adds.

“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.
The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020.

The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from Bangkok Post and The Nation. 
The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.
Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.

A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader —  who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.
The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.

According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:
"Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”

Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the invest…]]></summary>

Partners in the project include the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Dubai Future Foundation, according to an announcement from the Dubai government. The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase.

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside.

Traders are watching today’s volumes to see if emerging intraday trends are followed at the US open on May 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.
