La siguiente limpieza de recursos, no sólo estuvo relacionada con lo tecnológico, también con lo humano, y perdí mi trabajo 🙁, al igual que muchos de mis compañeros de área, se dice que esa limpieza de recursos fue muy efectiva a nivel de costos, y algunos meses después la empresa abandonó la nube, lo que se conoce como “repatriación de la nube” así que yo me volví una hater de la nube, ahora sin trabajo, y sin nube, regresé a las búsquedas en internet, no sólo para buscar un nuevo trabajo, si no para obtenerlo y no perderlo. 
Tras muchos años, me gusta catalogar esta historia como mi momento más humilde, pues fue una serie de eventos desafortunados que me llevaron a FinOps y que ahora, me siento feliz de recordar con cada proyecto que inicio para entender que los costos no sólo necesitan ser reducidos, requieren ser optimizados, y también recordar que en esta metodología no sólo hablamos de dinero, hablamos de cultura de innovación y valor (final feliz, he sido recontratada para ser FinOps en esa misma compañía en su reingreso a la nube)]]></summary>

        <link href="https://dev.to/judith677/conditional-grouping-from-sql-to-spl-37-3nej"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem Description & Analysis:


A certain database table has multiple fields that can be grouped.

Task: Now we need to perform conditional grouping: group by the first two fields ID and SPLIT. If there are no duplicate DATEs within the group, keep the record with the latest date in this group and replace AMOUNT with the sum of AMOUNTs in this group; If there are duplicate dates within the group, group the records in this group again by CUST, while retaining the record with the latest date in the current group, and replace the AMOUNT with the sum of the AMOUNTs in the current group.

SQL:
SELECT id, split,cust,date_column,
       CASE num_cust WHEN 1 THEN total_amount ELSE total_cust_amount  END AS amount
FROM   (
  SELECT t.*,
         COUNT(DISTINCT CASE rnk WHEN 1 THEN cust END)
           OVER (PARTITION BY id, split) AS num_cust
  FROM   (
    SELECT t.*,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY id, split ORDER BY date_column DESC) AS rnk,
           SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY id, split) AS total_amount,
           SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY id, split, cust) AS total_cust_amount
    FROM   test_table_mm t
  ) t
  WHERE  rnk = 1
)

SQL cannot retain grouped subsets and requires the use of multiple nested queries and multiple window functions for indirect implementation, resulting in complex code.
SPL: After SPL grouping, there is no need to aggregate immediately. The subsets can be kept for further calculation, and subsets can also continue to be grouped:
💭🧮 Try.DEMO

A1： Load data and sort it in reverse order by date.
A2： Group by the first two fields, but do not aggregate.
A3： Process each group of data: If the date is not duplicated, return the current group; otherwise, group the current group by CUST and return each group.
A4： Continue processing data of each group: Take the first record of the current group and replace AMOUNT with the sum of AMOUNTs of the current group.

You might have heard terms like "AI agents" floating around, but let's break down what Apple's new Foundation Models framework means for you, simply and practically.
At its heart, this framework gives your apps access to a large language model (LLM) that runs directly on your users' devices. This is a big deal for a few reasons:
 Privacy First: All the data stays on the device. Your users' information remains private, which is a huge win for trust and security.
 Works Offline: No internet? No problem! Since the model is on-device, your smart features can work anywhere.
 No Extra App Size: It's built into the operating system, so your app won't get bigger.

Lately, I’ve been working on an internal project where both the frontend and backend are in the same folder. And honestly, opening two terminals every single day just to start both servers became super boring and repetitive. Same project, same routine: open terminal, run frontend, run backend. It started to feel like a chore. So I finally decided to look for a smoother way to handle this.
In this blog post, you’ll learn how to automate running both frontend and backend servers with a single command, whether you're using PowerShell, CMD, or VS Code’s internal terminal with a task runner

In my last post, I shared the first project in my beginner series where I’m learning how to incorporate AI into Python coding by connecting it with something I love: basketball. My second project builds on that idea — it's a basketball jargon explainer.
This app allows users to enter a basketball term, and with the click of a button, it returns a beginner-friendly definition generated by AI.
Tools I Used:
Streamlit for creating the interactive web interface
LangChain to structure and manage the language model prompt
OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo for generating the explanations
Python-dotenv to securely manage my API key
I’m continuing to explore ways to make learning and building with AI both fun and practical. Feedback or suggestions are always welcome. Thanks for following along.

pnpm create next-app@latest my-new-app

Select your nextjs options
cd into your app




cd my-new-app

Create a new sanity project, embed the studio and create all the config files, from the cli




pnpm dlx sanity@latest init --create-project "My New App" --dataset production

Select your configuration options for your sanity project as well as the route for the embedded studio.
Add the scripts to generate types from your schemas and queries, to your package.json.
    "updateSchemaTypes": "sanity schema extract --enforce-required-fields",
    "generateQueryTypes": "sanity typegen generate",
    "generateTypes": "pnpm updateSchemaTypes && pnpm generateQueryTypes",


Now you can run pnpm generateTypes every time you update your schemas or add a new query using defineQuery function from next-sanity, and you can get typed queries.
Now you're all setup and ready to go!

Firebase is great, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution.
If you've ever built an app or website on your own, Firebase was probably your first thought for a backend. It bundles almost all common features: user authentication, real-time databases, file storage, push notifications, web hosting, and more. Plus, it's backed by Google and offers a generous free tier, making it seem like a developer's dream tool.

However, as your project grows, you might run into these issues:
Your data is locked into Google's ecosystem, making migration expensive.
Want to use a custom database structure or extend complex permissions?
It's challenging to implement. Costs quickly escalate once you exceed the free tier…]]></summary>

You pick up your phone, tap a name, and start talking.

No wires. No towers. Just the internet.
That’s VoIP — Voice over Internet Protocol. It’s how your voice travels across the internet instead of through copper lines or mobile towers.
In old-school phone systems (PSTN – Public Switched Telephone Network), your voice is converted into electrical signals and sent over physical lines.
With VoIP, your voice gets:
Chopped into digital packets
Sent across the internet
Reassembled on the other end
Think of it like teleportation — but for sound.
🕹️ Old phones = walkie-talkies with rules

💡 VoIP = voice emails sent in real time
Here’s where VoIP hides in plain sight:
Zoom and Google Meet

WhatsApp or Signal voice calls

Microsoft Teams

Discord voice chat

Smart assistants and intercoms



All powered by VoIP, even if you never noticed.
To make a VoIP call, you need:
A device — phone, browser, softphone, etc.


A network — Wi-Fi or mobile internet


A protocol — to set up, manage, and end the call
That’s where SIP comes in — the signaling hero we’ll meet soon.
VoIP = Voice over Internet Protocol

Sends your voice as data packets over the internet

Replaces traditional phone lines

Used by apps you already know and love

Relies on protocols (like SIP) to work its magic

One prompt + four tool-calls = a morning and evening digest that rescues you from inbox + calendar overload.

No new apps, no paid APIs—just Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks you already have.
I open my laptop at 8 a.m. and spend 15 + minutes digging through email, calendar, and to-dos before I even start real work.

By 5 p.m. I’m not sure what actually got done—or what fires are waiting for tomorrow.
Daily Focus Capsule delivers

2. Nice-to-do
3. Meetings

If a section is empty, write ‘None’. End with one upbeat,

The N+1 query problem happens when your app executes one query for the main model and one additional query for each related model. For example, if you're loading 100 posts with their authors, you could accidentally fire 101 queries!
