Based on your request, I’ll now write a 3,000-word analytical article titled “From Public AI to Army AI: How Artificial Intelligence Evolved from Civilian Use to Military Superpower.” This article will explore how AI moved from general-purpose tools (like ChatGPT, image generators, etc.) to highly sophisticated military 
Abstract


The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) from public-facing tools like chatbots and image generators to advanced military applications marks a transformative chapter in both technological and geopolitical history. What began as helpful assistants for writing essays and generating art is now being refined into autonomous weapon systems, battlefield intelligence tools, and strategic warfare s…]]></summary>

As a junior developer, it's easy to dismiss software architecture as something reserved for seniors, architects, or CTOs. You're often told to "just focus on writing code" or "get the feature working." And while that advice may hold some truth when you're starting, it's only part of the story.
Understanding software architecture doesn't mean memorizing patterns or diagramming systems with abstract terms. It starts with something much simpler: thinking in structure. And structure is something you're already writing every time you sit down to code. Learning architecture early gives you an edge. It sets the foundation for scalable, readable, and maintainable software.
Software architecture is the way a system is structured. Think of…]]></summary>

Introduction


Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed almost every domain of modern society—from personalized shopping to autonomous driving, healthcare diagnostics to predictive finance. At its core, AI is a general-purpose technology with the potential to amplify human capability, decision-making, and efficiency. While public AI focuses on consumer convenience, productivity, and societal advancements, a more covert and controversial branch has been growing in parallel: military AI.
Military AI, or AI in defense, takes these technological innovations and repurposes them for national security, warfare, surveillance, and strategic command. The transition from public AI to military …]]></summary>

The rapid advancement of computational technologies has given rise to different classes of machines tailored to specific computational needs. Among these are normal (or general-purpose) computers, which serve everyday tasks, and supercomputers, which tackle highly complex and data-intensive operations such as climate modeling, quantum simulations, and real-time threat detection. While they share some fundamental architectural principles, programming each type differs vastly in terms of approach, optimization, parallelism, and resource handling.
In this article, we will explore the core programming differences between normal computers and supercomputers. We will also delve into the architectural and theoretical reasons for these differences, compare typical programming enviro…]]></summary>

So I gave Linux Mint a shot. And honestly? It felt more like Windows than Windows does lately.
When I first booted into Mint, I was greeted with a welcome menu that walked me through the basics: update your system, pick your layout, customize a bit. It was smooth. No command-line gauntlet, no cryptic driver errors.
And here's the kicker: it immediately recognized my Alienware Graphics Amplifier and external NVIDIA GPU without any extra work. Just worked. That shocked me.

What is React DOM?
ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM-specific methods to interact with the HTML document. It is used to render React components into the actual DOM.
import React from 'react';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
ReactDOM acts as the bridge between React and the browser DOM.

Both npm and npx are command-line tools that come with Node.js, but they are used differently.
