Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don't own enough crypto. When you do, you don't own enough NFT's, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's weekly digest, Neurosell shares new successes and partnerships with apparel brands, IT integrators, and other company news.
One of the major Virton AI collaboration announcements among fashion companies was the launch of a pilot with premium clothing brand DeBacker's. The brand integrated with a fitting room based on Shopify, which is the first such integration.

Now the Neurosell team is actively working on other integration options, including Telegram and VK mini-apps. Examples of such integrations can be seen below:
DSM Icons Brand at VK Mini Apps;
NashLocь - Virtual fitting room in Telegram Mini Apps;
These integrations with new sales channels for an apparel brand can be up and running in a single day, which is one of the benefits of going full-fledged with Virton AI.
Also this week, Neurosell began competing in a battle for the title of Startup of the Week and Month on the Product Radar platform with Virton AI. The project hunter was Alexander Khopyorsky, founder of Brat AI
You can vote for Virton AI on the Product Radar page:
https://productradar.ru/product/virton/
Well, the latest news from Neurosell is that Virton AI's daily user traffic grew over 100% this week to over 3,000 daily users.
The product is currently in training and in collaboration with brands to develop its algorithms.

In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here's some of our money. We're putting it down. We're showing that we're serious about doing this.”

What started with two Papa John's pizzas has grown into a global phenomenon, a benchmark in the timeline of decentralized money. This moment in crypto history now lives alongside events like Mt. Gox, the Ethereum DAO hack, the rise of Layer 2s, and Satoshi Nakamoto’s lasting influence.

Welcome back to Day 28 of this practical Linux challenge! Part 2 of our beginner shell scripting series for RHEL 9.
Shell scripts become truly useful when they can store data, accept user input, and respond accordingly. 
In the previous article, you wrote your first script. Now, let’s make that script interactive by using variables and user inputs.

A variable is like a labeled box where you can store information for your script to use later.

Here, name is the variable, and "Alex" is the value stored in it.

To create a variable

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

Apple's Siri, a pioneering voice assistant, has faced persistent user complaints and criticisms over the past decade, primarily stemming from its functional limitations. These shortcomings, including frequent misinterpretation of commands, shallow responses, and a notable failure to maintain conversational context, have led to widespread user frustration. This report posits that Siri's anthropomorphic design cues—its human-like voice, tone, and conversational interface—are not merely aesthetic choices but are, in fact, the fundamental cause of user misperceptions. By implicitly encouraging users to treat Siri as if it possesses genuine understanding or thought, these design elements create unrealistic expectations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique crypto…]]></summary>

Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours.

On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

However, ownership declined, falling to 29% in 2025 from 40% the previous year, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21.

Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.”

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…]]></summary>

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules.

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure.
The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals. 
Microsoft says that Lumma has been sold via underground forums since 2022 and that it has undergone multiple upgrades since its launch.
