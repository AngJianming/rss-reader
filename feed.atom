        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber threats are evolving fast, and artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a major role in phishing attacks. These attacks, where hackers try to trick people into revealing sensitive information, are becoming more advanced.
Did you know? In 2023, over 60% of phishing attacks used AI tools to mimic human writing styles, making scams harder to spot. As artificial intelligence (AI) grows smarter, cybercriminals are weaponizing it to launch sneaky, personalized phishing attacks. But here’s the big question: Can these AI tricks fool even cybersecurity pros? Let’s break it down.
What Makes AI-Powered Phishing Different?
Poor grammar or spelling mistakes.
Can AI Outsmart Cybersecurity Experts?
Hyper-Personalized Attacks

How Cybersecurity Experts Fight Back?
AI Detectors: Tools like Darktrace scan emails for AI-generated text.
How to Protect Yourself
Slow Down: Phishing preys on panic. Check URLs before clicking.
The battle between hackers and cybersecurity experts is ongoing, but one thing is clear AI is changing the game for both sides.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When managing background processes or queue workers in a production environment, Supervisor is often the go-to process control system. But if you’ve ever worked with Supervisor on a Linux server, you've likely come across these two commands:
sudo service supervisor restart
&&
sudo supervisorctl restart [program_name]
They might look similar at a glance — both contain the word restart — but they operate at very different levels and are used in very different situations. Let’s break down what each command does, when to use it, and what to avoid in a production environment.
🔍 1. sudo service supervisor restart


✅ What it does
This command restarts the Supervisor daemon itself — not just the programs it manages. Think of it as turning Supervisor completely off and then back on.

Stacks have migrated. Infrastructure is containerized. CI/CD pipelines are green.
But behind the wave of “cloudification”, one question lingers:
Have we really changed the way we think?
Because on the surface, everything looks modern. But underneath?
⏱️ Services running 24/7

💤 Containers sitting idle, waiting for traffic that never comes

💸 Bills growing, even when no one clicks “deploy”
And in every retro, every finance meeting, the same old line:
“The cloud is expensive.”
But is it really the cloud that’s expensive?

Or is it…  
The quiet luxury of feeding CPUs that are just bored?
Let’s be honest.
Cloud-native isn’t Docker. It’s not Kubernetes. It’s not Terraform, or some magic mix of YAML, containers, and CI/CD.
Those are tools. Powerful ones. But tools.

Everyone’s buzzing about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) like it’s the second coming of AI engineering. And honestly? It kinda is. Your large language model is excellent at confidently making things up—because it doesn’t actually know anything beyond whatever data it was last trained on (hello, 2023). 
That’s where RAG comes in: bolting on real, external knowledge so your LLM stops hallucinating and starts reasoning.
But here’s the thing: knowledge isn’t just about facts. It’s about how things connect. And when relationships matter, you don’t want a flat file or a relational torture device. You want a graph.

With the signing of the bill into law, New Hampshire was the first of several US states considering passing legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, including an initiative with the federal government. A similar bill in Arizona passed the state’s House in April but was vetoed by Governor Katie Hobbs on May 2, and Florida’s government withdrew two crypto reserve bills from consideration on May 3.

The efforts to create crypto reserves in different US states come as US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers propose similar policies at the federal level. Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a “Digital Asset Stockpile” and a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.”

Senator Cynthia Lummis, who sponsored the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, proposed that the US government could hold more than 1 million BTC through civil and criminal forfeiture seizures. The bill is currently being considered by members of the US Senate Banking Committee.

The asset manager sees BNB’s price rising to approximately $1,275 per token by the end of 2025 and as high as $2,775 by the end of 2028, according to the research report.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations.

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to US President Donald Trump’s “ownership of crypto” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.

The post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting. The effort in question is the Dowell spinal fusogens project led by Michael Lebenstein-Gumovski, which raised 380,700 USDC (USDC) from donors. The dedicated HydraDAO page reads:

Berkshire already has indirect crypto exposure via Nu Holdings, Jefferies.

Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting on May 3 that he will step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel taking over. This transition raises speculation about Berkshire’s financial capacity to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) under the new leadership.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efforts to pass crypto legislation in the US Senate face mounting resistance amid growing ethical concerns around US President Donald Trump’s ties to crypto.
In a May 5 letter to the Office of Government Ethics, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley said that Trump and his family stand to personally profit from an investment involving UAE state-backed firm MGX, crypto exchange Binance and World Liberty Financial (WLFI).
The senators called for an urgent probe, warning the deal may violate the US Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and federal bribery statutes.
At the center of the controversy is WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, reportedly chosen for a $2 billion investment MGX plans to make into Binance.
The senators said the transaction amounts to a potential backdoor for foreign influence and s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin Core developers have decided to remove a limit on transaction data in the next network upgrade, enabling more data to be included in a more efficient way. 
“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government's 20-year “venom-laced” sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”
The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.
