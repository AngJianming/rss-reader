Programo em PHP desde 2010, estou de fato no mercado de trabalho desde 2016, utilizando na maioria das vezes como base o bom e velho PHP e desde então venho acompanhando a sua evolução. 
Apesar de algumas críticas, essa linguagem continua sendo a base de mais de 76% dos sites na web, impulsionando plataformas como WordPress, Facebook e Wikipedia. Neste artigo eu procurei trazer algumas informações e dados cruciais que exploram o por que o PHP permanece tão relevante, destacando o poder do WordPress, os frameworks versáteis, as integrações modernas e a enorme comunidade que mantém a lin…]]></summary>

Python, as a widely used programming language, plays a crucial role in the fields of data science and machine learning. However, when dealing with computationally intensive tasks, Python's performance often leaves much to be desired. Therefore, in the development of machine learning algorithms, Python is often used as a "glue language" and combined with C/C++ code, which is then compiled into a dynamic link library (a .so file) for Python to call. Nowadays, for developers who don't want to learn C/C++, Rust is a great alternative. Rust has a modern language design and runtime efficiency comparable to that of C/C++.

Instead, you'd:
Break down information into manageable tasks (chunking)
Highlight what's important (embeddings)
Organize materials for quick reference (vector storage)
Step 1: Smart Chunking - Serving Information in Bite-Sized Portions


Why Smaller Pieces Work Better

A function is a block of reusable code designed to perform a specific task. Unlike methods, functions are not tied to any particular object or data structure.
Functions are defined globally and can be called anywhere in your program, without the need for an object to invoke them.
Functions are independent and can work with any kind of data passed to them as arguments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Technical charts currently show XRP (XRP) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A "falling wedge" is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trading platform Robinhood has still managed to beat Wall Street estimates as its first-quarter revenues fell and its crypto trading volume cooled from a record high in Q4.
Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.
Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volum…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT (USDT), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thin…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it.
