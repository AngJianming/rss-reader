While Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) have improved logistics, concerns around tampering, limited accessibility, and trust still linger. During one of my personal brainstorming sessions, I started to think: what if we could rethink the voting process using the principles of decentralization?
This thought led to the creation of D-Vote, a decentralized voting system that combines the security of the Ethereum blockchain with Aadhaar-based authentication — making the process not only more transparent but also verifiable and tamper-resistant.

Recentemente surgiu uma dúvida relacionada a codificação usando padrões de projeto, princípios SOLID, orientação a objetos e outras coisas mais num mundo onde a IA está cada vez mais presente.
A ideia de utilizarmos padrões para codificarmos nossos softwares vem de longa data. Talvez a publicação mais antiga na nossa área seja o famosíssimo Padrões de Projeto (ou em inglês, Design Patterns) do GoF. Alguns anos depois, diversos livros contendo "padrões" no nome foram lançados, como o Padrões de Arquitetura de Aplicações Corporativas do Martin Fowler, Padrões de Implementação, do Kent Beck e até o Refatoração para Padrões do Joshua Kerievsky. Todos eles buscando facilitar a extensão do software e o seu entendimento por parte dos programadores.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[INHERITANCE


Java Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well. 
Inheritance promotes code reusability, method overriding, and polymorphism, which makes the Java program more modular and efficient. 
In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword. The class that inherits is called the subclass (child class), and the class being inherited from is called the superclass (parent class).
Types of Inheritance in Java:
Single Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance 
Java does not support multiple inheritance directly through classes. This means a class cannot extend more than one class. The primary reason for this limitation is to avoid the "complexities" and "ambiguities" associated with multiple inheritance, particularly the "diamond problem," where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. 
Method overloading can be performed within a single class, whereas method overriding occurs between a parent class and its child class, taking advantage of inheritance. Number of Methods: Method overloading allows the existence of multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
Overriding in Java occurs when a subclass or child class implements a method that is already defined in the superclass or base class. When a subclass provides its own version of a method that is already defined in its superclass, we call it method overriding. The subclass method must match the parent class method's name, parameters, and return type.]]></summary>

When there are only a few participants, they can exchange data directly. However, as the number of participants grows, the need for greater interactivity arises, making direct exchange inefficient. In such cases, a message broker manages the process and acts as an intermediary between the sender and the recipient.
In this article, we will explore how a message broker works and how it can be used.

The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.
“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…]]></summary>

On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph that have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.

“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

The second man is a Swiss crypto investor who allegedly assisted business partner Joel Woeltz, who is accused of kidnapping Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan and torturing him in a Soho apartment in an attempt to pressure him into revealing his crypto wallet phrase, ABC7 New York reported on May 26.
A separate NBC report said the Swiss trader —  who is not named — would turn himself over to police within a week. However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency industry groups are urging the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue formal guidance on staking, citing continued regulatory uncertainty for Web3 infrastructure providers, according to Allison Muehr, head of staking policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation, a trade group.
Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …]]></summary>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…]]></summary>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.
