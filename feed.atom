In this article, we will explore how to use a method called TestField within a GLAccount class to validate fields effectively. This method checks if the specified fields are blank, ensuring data integrity throughout your application.
Understanding the GLAccount Class
The GLAccount class represents an account type used in financial applications. The class generally contains properties like No and Name, which are crucial for identifying the account. Let's take a look at a basic definition of the GLAccount class:
public class GLAccount : Table<GLAccount, Code>
{
    [Key]
    public required string No { get; set; }
    public required string Name { get; set; }

JSON is the undisputed king of data interchange and configuration in modern software. Its simplicity and flexibility are its greatest strengths, but as JSON documents become more complex and integral to our systems, managing their lifecycle – tracking changes, understanding history, and ensuring integrity – presents a significant, often underestimated, challenge. The ad-hoc methods of commenting out old sections, manual file copies (config_v2_final_final.json), or relying solely on broad Git commits for fine-grained JSON changes often fall short.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted here
In this short post, I'll share with you a simple pattern 
I use to centralize error handling for my HTTP handlers.
If you've written any amount of Go HTTP servers, you've probably gotten tired of writing the same error handling code over and over again:
func SomeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    data, err := fetchSomeData()
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Failed to fetch data", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        log.Printf("Error fetching data: %v", err)
        return
    }

    // More if-err blocks...
}

This code is repetitive, error-prone, and clutters your handlers with boilerplate instead of business logic.
The core idea is simple: change your handlers to return errors instead of handling them directly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In software design, some objects are meant to be shared across the entire application. Think of a configuration manager, a database connection, or a logger. You don’t want to create multiple instances of these — just one that is reused everywhere. That’s exactly where the Singleton Pattern comes in.
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
It’s part of the Creational Design Patterns — patterns focused on object creation.
Think of a government. There’s only one Prime Minister (ideally 😄). If you try to create a new one, it should refer to the existing one.
Database connections
Logging services
Config/environment managers
Thread pools
Caching mechanisms
class Singleton {
  constructor() {
    if (Singleton.instance) {
      return Singleton.instance;
    }
    this.timestamp = new Date();
    Singleton.instance = this;
  }

  getTime() {
    return this.timestamp;
  }
}

// Usage
const a = new Singleton();
const b = new Singleton();

console.log(a === b); // true
console.log(a.getTime() === b.getTime()); // true

class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.timestamp = "Created at instance creation"
        return cls._instance

# Usage
a = Singleton()
b = Singleton()

print(a is b)  # True


Controlled access to a single instance
Saves memory (especially useful for expensive objects)
Can be lazily loaded (created only when needed)
Global state can be hard to test
Can violate Single Responsibility Principle
In multithreading environments, needs proper locking (especially in Java/C++)
Keep it stateless if possible
Avoid abusing it like a global variable
Be cautious in multi-threaded apps (use locks/mutexes)
The Singleton Pattern is a handy tool when you need exactly one instance of a class to coordinate actions across the system. Use it wisely and you’ll make your application more efficient and structured.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, you're using an app or a website — maybe checking your profile, scrolling through posts, or ordering pizza. Ever wonder what’s happening behind the scenes? Let’s break down how REST services make it all flow smoothly.
Here’s a quick look at how the process usually goes:
You open your browser and type in https://example.com/profile. The browser (aka client) sends a request to the server asking, “Hey, can I get this user’s profile info?”
The server gets the request, checks if you’re logged in, grabs your profile data from the database, and packages it all up nicely.
It then sends the data back, usually in JSON format — kind of like a digital takeout container with all your info inside.
The browser takes that JSON and turns it into something you can actually see and interact with — like your profile page with your name, picture, and posts.
The client and server are totally separate. This means your mobile app and your website can talk to the same backend. You can update one without breaking the other.
Your REST service can serve thousands of devices — phones, laptops, smart devices, you name it. As long as they follow the rules of the API, everyone gets served.
Frontend and backend developers can do their thing without stepping on each other's toes. One team works on the look and feel, the other focuses on logic and data. Fewer conflicts, faster development.
Let’s imagine this whole setup as a restaurant:
Client = Customer

You (the client) sit down and place your order.


Server = Kitchen

The kitchen (server) checks the order, prepares your meal, and puts it on a tray.


API = Waiter

The waiter (API) brings the meal from the kitchen to your table.


Response = Your Meal

You enjoy your food (data), without worrying how it was made.






So next time you refresh your feed or load a profile page, just remember: there's a mini restaurant working in the background — taking your order, cooking it up, and serving it fast.]]></summary>

“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…]]></summary>

"Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell," the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. "Strategy's holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders," Ju continued.
Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, is an outspoken Bitcoin advocate who evangelizes the scarce digital currency to potential investors and has inspired many other companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury plan.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.

“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”
The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.
According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?
