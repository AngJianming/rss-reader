In a May 16 announcement, AsiaStrategy said it is partnering with Sora Ventures to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Sora previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan’s first corporate Bitcoin treasury.
The stock market took immediate notice of the announcement. Top Win stock closed the trading day at $7.50 on May 15, but traded at $12.12 in premarket at the time of writing — a jump of over 60%.

AsiaStrategy’s luxury watchmaking business will continue alongside its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, rather than a full pivot.

Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}. Disassemble this (file).

As your application evolves, relying on local scripts or manual file uploads becomes a liability: it's slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error. In a production environment where uptime, reliability, and speed matter, you need something better.
That’s where CI/CD comes in.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) introduces automation and structure to your development workflow. With it, every change pushed to your repository can be automatically tested, built, and deployed—without manual steps. This reduces errors, accelerates delivery, and ensures your team spends less time deploying and more time building.

Monitoring and alerting are essential in the cloud but securing those alerts is important too. In this post, we are going to explore how to configure a CloudWatch Alarm so that you are being notified through an SNS topic, which is encrypted with KMS, so your alert data stays secured.
Note:
You must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to deliver Amazon SNS notifications with an encrypted Amazon SNS topic for a CloudWatch alarm. If you use the default alias/aws/sns AWS managed key for encryption, then the CloudWatch alarm fails to initiate the alarm action.

Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic's technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

I’ve worked on both fast-paced startups and large-scale enterprise systems, and I’ve seen the shift. Once teams start using TypeScript in backend services, especially with Node.js and frameworks like NestJS, productivity improves, bugs are caught earlier, and the onboarding process for new developers becomes smoother.
In enterprise backends, the cost of a runtime error is high. You’re dealing with customer data, financial transactions, third-party integrations. A wrong type in a critical flow can cascade into hours of downtime or worse, data corruption.

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based; Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

Bitcoin price consolidates as resistance at $105,000 prevents a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are slightly bearish, but historical data suggests a sudden bullish move should not be ruled out.


Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range over the past seven days as the $105,000 level remains the overhead resistance to break.

XRP is retesting a falling wedge breakout, which could lead to a rally toward $3.60.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.
Will XRP’s price sustain the recovery or drop further in the coming days? Let’s examine.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model.

Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end.

 
Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

There hasn't been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.
Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. 
The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.
Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.

On May 16, xAI provided an update on the Grok AI chatbot’s inflammatory responses, stating that on May 14, “an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X.”
“This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added.

The bad actors have been operating since April, using deepfake voice messages and text messages to masquerade as senior government officials and establish rapport with victims, the FBI said in a May 15 warning. 
“If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said.  
If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said.
