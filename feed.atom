 The 2 AM Moment That Started It All
So there I was, 2 AM, bleary-eyed, manually rewriting the same repetitive media queries into container queries for the fifth time that week. Coffee had stopped working hours ago. That's when I thought, "This is ridiculous. I'm building a tool for this." And here we are.
Traditional media queries only respond to the viewport size. This creates a fundamental problem in component-based design: how do you make a component respond to its parent container rather than the entire screen?
Consider a card component that appears in both a sidebar and the main content area. With media queries, both instances would apply the same styling at the same browser widths, regardless of their container size…]]></summary>

Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.”

That’s exactly what the Events module in OneEntry is for. It's not just a tool, but a true conductor of automation. It reacts to data changes, sends notifications, triggers integrations, and does it all without a single line of backend code.

It’s not just about saving time. It’s about unlocking a new level of interaction with both users and systems.

Let’s be honest:
Bad code isn’t just ugly. It’s expensive.
It breaks easily. It’s hard to maintain. It makes teams slower.
And if you’ve ever been scared to touch a 10,000-line legacy function—you know the pain.
Here’s how to avoid being that dev.
Let’s break down the real-world clean code principles every programmer should follow in 2024.
Name Things Like You Mean It


Bad: d, tmp, a1
userEmail, tempFilePath, apiResponse
Best Practices:
Use meaningful, descriptive names

Avoid abbreviations unless they’re standard (e.g. HTML, URL)
Use camelCase or snake_case consistently
Don’t reuse names for different things
Pause and reflect:
without comments?
Write Small Functions


Rule of thumb:
If your function does more than one thing, break it up.

The tail -f command, however, lets you watch a file for live changes. I decided to try it out by watching a file named hello.txt in the terminal while editing it using Vim.
But to my surprise, no changes appeared in the output of tail -f.
This made me curious, and I started digging into what was happening. That research led me to some really interesting concepts — and made me appreciate how smart Vim’s design actually is.

Whenever I tried, it wouldn't open, or it would launch and freeze instantly. I tried a couple of ways to fix it, like removing the cache, reinstalling, etc. I kept pushing off, but in the meantime, I used Brave Browser, which is good. But finally, I have solved the problem. Here's how I fixed it - and how you might be able to as well.
Whenever I launched Chrome:
It takes time to open, or sometimes it doesn't open
It froze immediately, or
It would run, but the pages wouldn't load
I lived with this issue for months, then switched to Brave, but I always tried to fix it because Chrome is my go-to browser all the time.
Before I found the fix, I tried:
Reinstalling Chrome
Removed all the extensions
Cleared cached and profile data
Restarting the laptop
Go to your Chrome settings

Now, in the settings, select the System option, and you'll see options like these or maybe other options as well.

I disabled the "Use graphics acceleration when available" option, and it worked fine afterwards without any freezes occurring.

After disabling it, restart Chrome.
I'm not sure of the exact details, but ChatGPT explained it to me in a clear and organised manner.,
I wish I had tried this sooner, but you know what? I got my Chrome working normally again, and I am very happy.
Did this fix work for you? Got a different solution that helped?
Drop a comment or connect with me - I'd love to hear your experience!]]></summary>

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens.

At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure.
The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.
