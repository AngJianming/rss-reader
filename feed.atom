Terraform stands out as a powerful tool for operations teams, enabling the automation of infrastructure provisioning in an industrialized and scalable manner. Its declarative approach allows users to define the desired state of their infrastructure, and Terraform handles the complexities of achieving that state. Unlike tools such as Pulumi, which necessitate proficiency in programming languages like Go or Python, Terraform significantly boosts productivity without requiring any programming language knowledge. Instead, it leverages a scripting-like syntax, empowering operations professionals to build robust infrastructures declaratively.

Let’s explore how time tracking, when done right, can be a powerful tool for Agile teams.
Velocity charts, burndown graphs, and story points are great. But they don’t always answer questions like:
Why did this sprint go off track?
How much time do we spend in meetings vs. building features?
Are we consistently underestimating certain types of tasks?
These are the kinds of questions that time tracking helps answer.

Knowing CORS inside out doesn’t just make you feel smarter—it’s critical for building secure systems on the internet.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is like a big bouncer at the gate of your browser’s exclusive club, saying:
“SORRY, YOU’RE NOT ON THE LIST.”

There are many ways to learn about CORS. In this blog, we’re ditching the frontend perspective (and the cybersecurity deep dive) to focus on:
What CORS actually does
Why it exists
How you—the backend dev—are in charge of making it behave

Welcome back to Day 27 of this practical Linux challenge! 
If you have been following my articles and practicing your commands on RHEL 9, then you are already using the shell! 
Now, imagine having the shell perform multiple tasks for you automatically. That is what shell scripting is all about.

A shell is a command-line interpreter that lets you interact with the operating system. Shell scripting is the process of writing a series of shell (command-line) instructions in a file that can be executed like a program.
Think of it like creating your own little tool to automate boring or repetitive tasks!

In 1989, deep within the sprawling scientific corridors of CERN in Geneva, Tim Berners-Lee faced a quiet but maddening challenge. Physicists were drowning in data — yet they had no shared way to access or link it.
Information was locked inside incompatible systems. A document on a VAX machine couldn’t be easily opened by a UNIX terminal. Sharing findings required a combination of emails, FTP commands, and paper printouts. It was a fragmented world.
Tim drafted a proposal: "Information Management: A Proposal." It introduced a radical thought — using hypertext over the internet to interconnect documents. A web... a World Wide Web.

Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take contro…]]></summary>

The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After weeks of speculation among crypto enthusiasts and news outlets, Tron founder Justin Sun has claimed he owns the wallet that purchased the largest amount of Donald Trump’s memecoin, allowing him to qualify for a dinner and reception with the US president.
In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.
According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to annou…]]></summary>

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ether (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed. 
“The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read.
The task force is being dissolved despite pressure from opposition groups, which are seeking to activate an investigative commission as soon as May 20, local media outlet Clarin reported.

Ether’s price rose over 5% to $2,520 on May 20, mirroring similar upward moves across the wider cryptocurrency market.

Ethereum’s record open interest, rising funding rates and a significant short squeeze fuel the rally.

Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won't function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.
The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2's structural frameworks.
In “Fat Protocols,” Joel Monegro argued that value within the internet stack comprises "thin" protocols and "fat" applications. In other words, investing in the underlying protocol technologies like TCP/IP, HTTP, and SMTP gives lower ret…]]></summary>

On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.
