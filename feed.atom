        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The In-Memory Advisor in Oracle 23ai analyzes database workloads to estimate DB-Time for various In-Memory sizes. Additionally, it can recommend which objects should be placed in the In-Memory column store.
To use this feature, you must leverage the DBMS_INMEMORY_ADVISE package. The procedure for running the In-Memory Advisor is similar to the Privilege Analysis feature. To generate advice regarding In-Memory optimization, you first need to start a task and let it analyze the database workload. Once sufficient analysis has been performed, you can stop the task and review the generated report.
The following sections detail the steps to generate the report:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I’m Mridul Bansal. I’m 18. A first-year student at Newton School of Technology, Pune — but this isn’t about college.
This is about a choice I made a few weeks ago: to become one of the top 100 AI/ML minds on the planet in the next 3 years. And I’m documenting everything. Every hour, every line of code, every mental breakdown, every rebuild.
This is Day 1 of that journey.
But it didn’t start today.
In March, I joined offline coaching for Full Stack + AI/ML because YouTube wasn’t enough for me. I’m someone who learns best when I’m all in — environment, people, mindset. So I customized my learning path:
Full Stack (MERN)
My mindset shifted fast. From just wanting to stay ahead in college → to dominating my batch → to aiming at global level skill. That’s how I landed here.
What I Did This Week


This past week was about setting foundations — mentally, technically, and emotionally.
My Weekly System (Moving Forward)
Execution Stack:
React.js + MongoDB coming next
_


  
  
  Posting Plan-


_
I won’t be posting every day. I’ll post here once a week — just to keep it real and show exactly what I’ve built or learned. No fluff. Just raw execution logs, week by week.
Closing Thought-


I’m not doing this blog for likes. I’m writing this so that when someone 2 years from now wants to know how I did it — they won’t just see the success, they’ll see the system.
No motivation quotes. No branding tricks.
Just one guy documenting his rebuild.
Let’s build.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the Head of Engineering at Bacancy, I often speak with businesses that are hesitant about moving to the cloud. They understand the benefits but worry about the complexity. What if the migration disrupts operations? What if costs go out of control? What if the existing infrastructure is too rigid to support the transition?
These are valid concerns. But when a company like Bajaj Finance successfully moves its core lending platform to the cloud, it sends a strong message. If they can do it, so can you.
This shift was not just a technical upgrade. It was a clear business decision aimed at making their infrastructure more agile, secure, and ready for growth. Bajaj’s move demonstrates that even the most critical systems can run better in the cloud. And they are not alone. We’ve helped several…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“We version packages, sign commits, and write changelogs — but our UIs stay anonymous.”
That didn’t sit right with me.

So I built trustthe.dev — a minimal UI component that makes your frontend self-describing.
The component adds a small, persistent version tag to your UI, revealing:
Package version (from package.json)
Git commit hash, author, and message
Repo + build branch
Tech stack
humans.txt link
Structured schema metadata (ld+json) for the developer
It’s SSR-safe, fully customizable, and built with shadcn/ui principles.
Install it via the official shadcn CLI:
npx shadcn@latest add https://trustthe.dev/r/version.json 

Then drop the <Version /> component into your layout.
👀 Why?
This isn’t a marketing badge.
→ Read the trustthe.dev Manifesto
If you're a developer who versions, documents, and stands behind their work — this might be for you.

Let's build a lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Java using the powerful and flexible a2ajava library. The a2ajava library is a "swiss knife" for building agentic applications in multiple languages such as Java and Kotlin, supporting multiple protocols.

✅ Cross-protocol: Supports both MCP (Model Context Protocol) and Google A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
✅ Cross-platform: Runs on any OS with JVM support
✅ Cross-language: Compatible with clients built in JavaScript, Python, or even LLM agents like Claude and Google A2A client
✅ Flexible Implementation: Use Spring Boot, Quarkus, or pure Java/Kotlin

Create a simple Java class to handle MCP requests. Here's a basic example:

This also seems to confirm what I mentioned before—AI wrappers will eventually be replaced by products developed directly by major AI companies. After all, it's hard to compete with their funding and technical resources. It looks like the AI race will continue to be a battle between big companies and capital.
What we can do, realistically, is focus on the application layer. Diving too deep into prompt engineering can’t really keep up with the impact of a single new product release from an major AI company—especially considering how fast things are evolving right now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The use of yield return in C# has always been a bit of a mystery to me, but recently I’ve come to understand a bit better how it works and when it can be useful.
Put simply, yield return allows you to generate values on demand as if they were part of a collection (IEnumerable), without having to manually create or populate a list. Items are returned one by one, only when needed, without storing them all in memory beforehand. Its main advantage lies in supporting lazy evaluation.
Imagine you're working on a system that processes data from a large source (maybe a .csv file to be imported or even a .txt log file). In such cases, yield return can optimize memory usage, since it lets you load only one line at a time and begin processing immediately, without waiting to read the entire file.

A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…]]></summary>

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

"The downside of the public internet is it was never built for high-performance systems. It was always built for this sort of relationship of one big server talking to one little server," Federa told Cointelegraph in an interview at Consensus 2025. The executive explained:

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
"We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat."

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…]]></summary>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…]]></summary>

However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.

According to a May 15 statement from Paraguayan prosecutor Irene Rolón, the men were caught by police soon after breaking into a locked section of Teratech SA’s facility in Coronel Bogado, leading to their arrest.
Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.
