👀 What’s This All About?
Imagine your Linux server is a castle. You’re the ruler (root user), but you’ve left the front gates wide open. Anyone — bots, hackers, curious squirrels — can walk in.
Enter iptables, the grumpy gatekeeper with a clipboard. You give him rules, and he checks every visitor (aka network packet). Only the worthy get through.
Whether you're:
 Spinning up cloud VMs
 Hosting your app backend
 Dealing with pesky port scanners
..you need to understand iptables.
⚔️ Why Should Developers or DevOps Folks Care?

"You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." — James Clear, Atomic Habits
With remote and hybrid work a norm and productivity tools ubiquitous, why do developers continue in stuck cycles of shallow work?
The truth is: the majority of productivity problems have little to do with will or time. They're a product of environments—both physical and virtual—that discourage continuous work.
Recent reports quote over 86% of software developers working remotely in 2025, and at least two-thirds would rather continue that way.

Yesterday it was announced that OpenAI was buying Windsurf, an AI-first code editor, for $3 billion. This is a pretty amazing feat considering that Windsurf has only been Windsurf since November 2024, a long seven months ago. Before that, it was Codeium, an AI-complete tool that plugged into existing IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains. And before that, way back in 2021, it was founded as Exafunction, which focused on optimizing GPU usage for Machine Learning workloads.
A $3B acquisition is indeed extreme, considering Windsurf's annualized recurring revenue (ARR) is reportedly $40m, which makes it a 75x acquisition premium. For context, a typical premium for a mature Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business …]]></summary>

Are you looking to enhance the visual appeal of your QComboBox in PyQt5? Using stylesheets is an effective way to adjust the background color, size, and other visual aspects of your combobox. This guide will delve into a code example, highlighting how styles can impact the appearance of QComboBox widgets when they're opened and closed.
Understanding the Problem
In your existing code, you're encountering issues with the visual representation of the QComboBox when certain styles are applied. Specifically, you noted that the dimensions of the background rectangle behind the QComboBox change, which is likely due to padding or margin settings in the stylesheet. It's essential first to comprehend how these properties work alongside the widget's default styles, especially when using …]]></summary>

Traditional security training isn’t working—60% of breaches still involve human error.
One-size-fits-all programs fail to engage, adapt, or reflect how people actually work.
Human risk management replaces static training with real-time behavior tracking and smart nudges.
HRM helps build lasting security habits—reducing risk and empowering users in the workflow.
Companies are pouring more money than ever into training their people to spot and stop cyber threats. But despite the investment, one stubborn issue won’t go away: humans are still behind the vast majority of data breaches.

Explanation:
If you want somebody not to access specific function through object you can do it by applying the @staticmethod. 
And do not pass 'self' because it will create connection with other attribute.
But if you seen closely general_description is accessible through object and class also. So the question arises does this statement defy us.
Well answer is, Yes, it does.
Here is analogy:
You will kept your screwdriver, hammer or nickel in toolbox, so that somebody want to access it he/she will look for toolbox.


If you travel through airplane doesn't which model of airplane you travel the manual of that plane will remain same like how to tie seatbelt.



Same as goes for static method you just access static method function through class not by object and it doesn't defy its meaning.

That's where the real value lies - improving the conversation, not just documenting it.
It's simple really - teams don't need another tool for meeting minutes.

When styling buttons with CSS, achieving a seamless hover effect is crucial for a great user experience. The problem arises when you have a hover effect that causes a noticeable flicker when you release the mouse button.

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide…]]></summary>

In a May 6 X post after court proceedings had likely ended for the day, Karony said he was innocent and “did not commit fraud” in response to media coverage of his trial. The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.
According to reporting from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) on May 6, Karony implied that Nagy, who reportedly fled to Russia after authorities filed charges, was responsible for some of the alleged fraud at Saf…]]></summary>

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward. 
“This resilience isn't just about price action — strong fundamentals also back it,” Joao Wedson, CEO of investing analytics platform Alphractal, said in an April X post. “Binance has built a massive ecosyste…]]></summary>

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

Bitcoin price hangs near $97,000 as traders await today’s FOMC minutes.

Bitcoin holding $95,000 as support is key for bullish price expansion in the short term.

Select altcoins are holding their respective support levels, opening the gates for a short-term rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to knock down the immediate resistance at $97,895 and challenge the all-important $100,000 level. Crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin are positive about further gains as they have acquired 81,338 Bitcoin over the past six weeks.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>
