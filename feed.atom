        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About Author
GeoServer is a widely-used open-source server for sharing, processing, and editing geospatial data. It supports multiple mapping standards and allows users to access and interact with GIS data over the web.
In June 2025, two critical security vulnerabilities in GeoServer were publicly disclosed:
SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2024-29198)
XXE vulnerability (CVE-2025-30220)
Both flaws allow unauthenticated attackers to read sensitive files on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise. If you are running GeoServer, immediate action is highly recommended.
When PROXY_BASE_URL is not configured, GeoServer allows unauthenticated access to the TestWfsPost endpoint. This misconfiguration can be abused to send internal or external requests via the GeoServer, resulting in SSRF.

GitOps has revolutionized how organizations manage their infrastructure and applications, ushering in an era of declarative, automated, and auditable operations. At its core, GitOps hinges on four foundational principles: declarative infrastructure, using Git as the single source of truth for the desired state, automated synchronization of the actual state with the desired state in Git, and continuous reconciliation to detect and correct any deviations. This methodology has brought unparalleled transparency, stability, and speed to software delivery. However, as cloud-native environments grow in complexity and cost, and as sustainability becomes a critical concern, the evolution of GitOps naturally progresses to integrate more intelligent, financially …]]></summary>

How to test:
💡DevTools → mobile mode → set zoom at the top, next to sizes
💡Check on real device - mobile browser main menu → zoom. Try zooming in/out ±60%. Your layout should flex — not break.
Good news: with plain HTML/CSS, it’s easy to achieve:
🔧Use flex and grid (with media queries for ≤240px)
🔧Set sizes in fr, %, em
🔧Avoid hardcoded widths and positions
🔧Let containers auto-resize
🔧Don’t fight the layout engine (but sometimes you need to fight managers and designers which love pixels).
Zoom support is just as important as screen width adaptation — Your users (and their eyes) will thank you.]]></summary>

Have you ever asked yourself that question when starting a new React app? Whether it’s a tiny side project or a big production app, I’m pretty sure we’ve all wondered: “What’s the best way to structure this so it looks clean and scales well later?”
Well, here’s the truth: There’s no official standard. Since React is just a library, not a full-blown framework, it doesn’t force you into any specific folder structure or project layout.
That’s why in this post, I’ll be sharing what’s worked for me, based on personal experience and a lot of research. Hopefully, it’ll give you a solid starting point to organize your own React projects in a clean and scalable way.

I stumbled upon the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework on GitHub and was immediately captivated by its performance metrics. The official documentation states:
"Hyperlane is a high-performance and lightweight Rust HTTP framework designed to simplify the development of modern web services while balancing flexibility and performance."
I decided to use it for my distributed systems course project. I started with the Cargo.toml file:
[dependencies]
hyperlane = "5.25.1"

Today, I delved into the design of Hyperlane's Context. In traditional frameworks, you would retrieve the request method like this:
let method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();

But Hyperlane offers a more elegant approach:
let method = ctx.get_request_method().await;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyperlane：新一代高性能Rust框架的实战体验


作为一名大三计算机专业的学生，我在最近的课程项目中深入使用了 Hyperlane 框架。这个被称为"新一代轻量级高性能框架"的 Rust Web 框架确实给我留下了深刻印象。本文将从实战角度，分享我对 Hyperlane 的使用体验。
在项目开始时，我对比了几个主流的 Web 框架：



框架
依赖模型
异步运行时
中间件支持
SSE/WebSocket
路由匹配能力




Hyperlane
仅依赖 Tokio + 标准库
Tokio
✅ 支持请求/响应
✅ 原生支持
✅ 支持正则表达式


Actix-Web
较多内部抽象层
Actix
✅ 请求中间件
部分支持(需插件)
⚠️ 路径宏需显式配置


Axum
复杂的 Tower 架构
Tokio
✅ Tower 中间件
✅ 需依赖扩展
⚠️ 动态路由较弱



最终选择 Hyperlane 的原因是：
极简的依赖关系
完整的异步支持
原生的 WebSocket 集成
灵活的路由系统
server.enable_nodelay().await;
server.disable_linger().await;
server.http_line_buffer_size(4096).await;

Hyperlane 默认启用了这些性能优化选项，这意味着它为高并发连接场景预设了合适的 TCP 和缓冲区参数。
在实际项目中，我使用 wrk 进行了压力测试：
wrk -c360 -d60s http://localhost:8000/

测试结果令人惊喜：



框架
QPS
内存占用




Hyperlane
324,323
最低


Rocket
298,945
中等


Gin (Go)
242,570
较高



server
    .host("0.0.0.0").await
    .port(60000).await
    .route("/", root_route).await
    .route("/goods/{id:\\d+}", goods_detail).await
    .run().await
    .unwrap();

所有配置都采用异步链式调用模式，无需嵌套配置或宏组合。
#[get]
async fn ws_route(ctx: Context) {
    let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();
    ctx.set_response_body(key)
        .await
        .send_body()
        .await;
}

原生的 WebSocket 支持让实时消息推送变得简单。
#[post]
async fn sse_route(ctx: Context) {
    ctx.set_response_header(CONTENT_TYPE, TEXT_EVENT_STREAM)
        .await
        .send()
        .await;

    for i in 0..10 {
        ctx.set_response_body(format!("data:{}{}", i, HTTP_DOUBLE_BR))
            .await
            .send_body()
            .await;
    }
}

零平台依赖：纯 Rust 实现，跨平台一致性强
极致性能优化：底层 I/O 使用 Tokio 的 TcpStream 和异步缓冲
灵活的中间件机制：支持请求和响应中间件，生命周期划分清晰
开箱即用的实时通信：原生支持 WebSocket 和 SSE
v4.22.0 后，ctx.aborted() 可以中断请求
v5.25.1 中的 ctx.closed() 可以主动关闭连接
从简单路由开始：先熟悉基本的 GET/POST 路由
理解 Context 抽象：这是框架的核心概念
循序渐进学习中间件：先使用内置中间件，再尝试自定义
关注性能优化选项：了解默认配置的作用
探索在微服务架构中的应用
研究与其他 Rust 生态系统的集成
尝试贡献一些社区插件
作为一个学生开发者，我认为 Hyperlane 是一个非常值得投入时间学习的框架。它不仅让我深入理解了 Web 开发的本质，还让我体会到了 Rust 在 Web 领域的强大潜力。如果你也在寻找一个性能强大且易于上手的 Rust Web 框架，Hyperlane 绝对值得一试！]]></summary>
