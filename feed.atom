Renaming the table and column names using lowercase snakecase.

Validation of data types, e.g, ascertaining that numeric columns are numeric.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I Built a Landing Page in 1 Day to Validate My SaaS Idea (Almost for Free)



Hi everyone! I'm currently building SaaS Status — a simple status page and uptime monitoring tool for indie SaaS products. Here's how I built the landing page in one day and started validating the idea — with minimal budget and no coding.
Before doing anything, I researched the market:  
What similar tools exist?

What do they cost?

What features do they offer?
Then, I asked ChatGPT to help me brainstorm the landing page structure and copy, based on my product positioning and pricing ideas. It helped a lot with organizing thoughts and turning them into actual text.
I found a clean and free Framer template and spent around 5 hours customizing it:
Replaced all text with my own.
Adjusted the layout slightly.
Generated screenshots and visuals with ChatGPT's help.
Designed a simple logo in Figma (inspired by an image ChatGPT generated!).
This was the only part that wasn’t free:
Domain: $12

Framer Pro plan: $20/month (to connect my domain)



And that’s it — I published it!
Now I'm driving my first traffic to the landing page via Reddit, Twitter, Indie Hackers, and dev.to. My goal is to see if anyone's interested enough to leave an email — or ideally pre-order.
If this resonates with enough people, I’ll continue development and turn SaaS Status into a full product. If not — I’ll have only lost one day and $32. Not bad!
👉 You can check it out here: https://saasstatus.app
I’ve launched several SaaS projects before. Every time, monitoring was an afterthought — and I often found myself wondering:

"Is my app down?"

"Did that Stripe webhook fail?"

"Why am I only finding out from users?"
So this time, I’m building what I wish I had:

A simple tool that notifies me (and my users) when something breaks — so I can fix it before the support inbox explodes.
Thanks for reading! I’d love to hear your thoughts — and follow your projects too 💬]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sabe aquele componente puro (Pure Component) que você cria no React e que praticamente nunca muda? Aquela função que é instanciada uma única vez, sempre igual?
Parabéns: você já aplicou o Singleton Pattern  — mesmo sem saber! 😄

Vamos entender como isso acontece na prática?
Singleton é um padrão de projeto que garante que uma classe tenha apenas uma instância e fornece um ponto de acesso global para ela.
Em apps React, um “componente singleton” acontece quando criamos algo que não precisa de novo estado ou novas instâncias cada vez que usamos.
Exemplo real no projeto ws-boilerplate-vite-react, é o componente Header :
// Design Patterns: Singleton
// https://deviq.com/design-patterns/singleton
export const Header = () => {
  return (
    <nav className="flex h-14 items-center bg-black p-2 font-black text-green-500">
      WS Medical Records
    </nav>
  );
};

Esse Header:
Não guarda estado.
Não depende de props para alterar.
Sempre que chamado, é a mesma estrutura, a mesma lógica.
Isso é um Singleton disfarçado de componente funcional!
O React já otimiza esses componentes de forma muito eficiente. Ao não guardar estado e não depender de props dinâmicas, ele pode:
Reutilizar instâncias na memória.
Evitar renders desnecessários.
Facilitar a previsão de comportamento.
No mundo real do React, muitos Singletons surgem naturalmente, principalmente em componentes puros, pequenos e previsíveis.
Entender isso te ajuda a:
Escrever componentes mais otimizados.
Melhorar a performance do seu app.
Reconhecer padrões de projeto que você já domina (sem sofrimento teórico!).
E aí, você sabia disso?

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

The Dubai-based exchange, which processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume last year, is “actively reassessing potential opportunities” in the United States, CEO Luuk Strijers told the FT.
He cited the “recent shift toward a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto in the US” as a key motivator behind the decision.
Deribit’s potential plan to expand into the US comes amid reports that Coinbase is in advanced negotiations to acquire the platform.

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

Analyst predicts that a low VIX, specifically below 18, signals a risk-on market, which could potentially boost the Bitcoin price to $135,000 within the next 100 days.

The stablecoin market cap hits $220 billion, driving crypto liquidity and Bitcoin’s bullish price action.

A negative Bitcoin funding rate hints at a possible short-squeeze to $100,000.

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government is aiming for a 90% adoption rate among local merchants. The executive also told Cointelegraph:
"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

The nodes mostly comprise human users who provide data in exchange for rewards via the network’s mobile application, COIN. “The vast majority of our 10 million nodes are mobile users, but some are IoT devices like smart speakers,” Levin told Cointelegraph. 
Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.
They include truckers, rideshare drivers, delivery people, and nurses among others, Levin said, adding that “95% convert after onboarding through the COIN app.”

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the annals of financial history, few institutions have faced the tempests of competition with the steadfast resolve of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). Born in 2013 as a private placement, GBTC pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment, granting investors access to Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric rise without the perils of digital wallets or unregulated exchanges.
On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds. 
Even still, GBTC’s financial resilience shines, generating $268.5 million in annual revenue, surpassing the $211.8 million of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, despite losing over …]]></summary>

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure.

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

XRP’s strongest spot premium phase suggests real buying demand, not just speculative futures trading. 

The number of XRP addresses holding ≥10,000 tokens has steadily climbed, even during recent price pullbacks. 

A falling wedge pattern points to a possible breakout toward $3 to $3.78, with up to 70% upside if confirmed.

XRP (XRP) is experiencing its strongest sustained phase of spot premium in history, a period where the spot market has been consistently trading at stronger levels compared to perpetual futures.

Appetite for global risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) may take another hit, with analysts from Apollo Global Management predicting a recession by the summer.
“Apollo predicting Summer Recession: Sharpest decline in earnings outlook since 2020,” cross-asset analyst Samantha LaDuc wrote in an April 26 X post.

According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”
But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. 
Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.
Throughout April, a groundswell of lawsuits led by 13 states further challenged Trump’s ambitious tariff program. Their success or failure rests on hundreds of years of judicial policy an…]]></summary>

KuCoin was among those affected by the country’s crackdown on unregistered platforms that were previously available. While the platform is now unavailable to South Koreans, it has not fully abandoned the jurisdiction. 
In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, KuCoin’s newly appointed CEO, BC Wong, said that the crypto exchange has plans to reenter the country.
