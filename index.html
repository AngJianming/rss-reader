                              <span>Modern tech companies are discovering that when they hire data scientists, pairing them with DevOps engineers creates exponential value. This partnership has become essential for organizations seeking to move beyond proof-of-concept models into production-ready solutions that deliver real business impact. The traditional approach of hiring these roles separately often leads to deployment bottlenecks and missed opportunities.
Industry leaders like Netflix, Spotify, and Airbnb have demonstrated how integrated data science and DevOps teams accelerate innovation cycles. Their success stems from recognizing that data insights are only valuable when they can be deployed reliably and scaled efficiently. This realization has shifted hiring strategies across the tech industry.

                              <span>A destructor (del) is used to clean up resources when an object is about to be destroyed. It doesn&#x27;t run immediately after an object is no longer used, but is triggered automatically by Python&#x27;s garbage collector when there are no more references to that object.
Important Points:
Python automatically calls the destructor (del)


When no more variables reference an object, Python automatically calls del() (if defined).


When is del() useful?



You might define a destructor when:
You need to close a file.
You don’t manage memory directly (like in C/C++).
Python handles memory.
You can’t force the garbage collector to run at an exact time (though you can suggest it using gc.collect()).

It watches which objects you&#x27;re using.
When you stop using something and forget it, the housekeeper eventually throws it out.
If you say del obj, you&#x27;re telling the housekeeper: &quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t need this anymore.&quot;
But the housekeeper decides when to actually throw it out.</span>

                              <span>Rate limiting is essential for most production applications. At a minimum, it prevents floods of traffic from crashing services, and it mitigates an app’s vulnerability to a variety of attacks. Adding and effectively configuring rate limiting is no simple task though. There are many rate limiting tools and strategies to choose from, and it’s difficult to find resources that concretely explain how to use rate limiting to improve an app’s security and resilience.
This is the first article in a series that will bring together the theory and practice of rate limiting, using contextualized real-world examples. In each article, I’ll demonstrate how to add different rate limiters to a Hono app, and discuss the technical and business requirements they fulfill.

                              <span>🧠 1. Overview of Stale Closure in React


In React, a common but subtle bug is the &quot;stale closure&quot; — which happens when a function inside a component uses an outdated value, not reflecting the current state or props.

This often leads to unexpected behavior, especially in callbacks, useEffect, or asynchronous logic.
Understanding how JavaScript creates closures and how React handles re-renders is key to avoiding this issue.
Scope defines the visibility of variables. In JavaScript, we have function scope and block scope.
A closure occurs when a function remembers variables from the scope where it was defined, even if it&#x27;s executed elsewhere.
Example:
function outer() {
  let count &#x3D; 0;
  return function inner() {
    console.log(count); // closure retains the value of count
  };
}

                              <span>As a runner and fitness enthusiast, sleep is essential for my recovery — and yet, it’s something I’m constantly working to improve. I aim for 8 hours a night, but my Apple Watch reports an average closer to 6.5 hours over the past few months, with some nights dipping as low as 5. Being a light sleeper doesn’t help either. I’ve experimented with wax earplugs to block out noise and blackout curtains to keep light at bay.
One thing I’ve wanted to automate for a while now is disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on the devices near my bed — including both my personal and work MacBooks, my iPhone, and ideally even my Apple Watch (which I wear to track sleep). These devices all stay in my bedroom overnight, so minimizing potential sleep disruptors has become a personal experiment.

                              <span>BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has seen its largest inflow in the past two weeks as traders allocate to US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to scoop up the rocketing cryptocurrency.
IBIT’s May 21 net inflows hit $530.6 million, its biggest single-day net inflow since it took in $531.2 million on May 5, according to Farside Investors. The ETF hasn’t had an outflow since April 9.
In one day alone, IBIT has accumulated over 10 times the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) mined over the same timeframe, with it scooping up 4,931 BTC against just 450 BTC produced for the day.
IBIT also saw its largest volume day since January, according to the ETF tracking X account Trader T. 
“Given trading volume today, expect these inflow numbers to increase,” said ETF Store president Nate Geraci.

                              <span>Decentralized finance platform Synthetix has axed its $27 million plan to acquire crypto options platform Derive after negative community feedback.
A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s, “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.”
Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. 
Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of les…</span>

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.

                              <span>America’s powerful banking lobby is “panicking” over the potential of stablecoins to disrupt their traditional business model, particularly when it comes to yield-bearing stablecoins, according to Austin Campbell, a New York University professor and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting. 
In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in t…</span>

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether&#x27;s recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It&#x27;s a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

                              <span>Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  
After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

                              <span>Guatemala’s largest bank, Banco Industrial, has integrated crypto infrastructure provider SukuPay into its mobile banking app, allowing locals to more easily receive remittances powered by blockchain technology. 
SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. 
Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said. 
SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph that the “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user” so that there are no technical barriers.
