This comprehensive guide covers every major aspect users are searching for, from core concepts and benefits to real-world use cases, challenges, and emerging trends for 2025 and beyond.
1. What Is AI in Manufacturing?
AI in manufacturing refers to the deployment of intelligent algorithms, machine learning (ML), computer vision, and data analytics to automate, optimize, and enhance every stage of the production lifecycle. This includes everything from design and assembly to quality control, supply chain management, and predictive maintenance. AI works both autonomously and alongside human wor…</span>

                              <span>Personalization is at the heart of modern digital experiences. Whether it’s suggesting the right product, showing tailored promotions, or dynamically updating content, users expect fast, relevant interactions across every touchpoint. But here’s the challenge: the closer the personalization logic lives to the backend, the more latency and potential bottlenecks you introduce. That&#x27;s where Akamai EdgeWorkers change the game.
Edge computing has revolutionized how we think about performance. Instead of relying entirely on origin servers, we can now push business logic and personalization closer to the user—right to the edge.

Traditionally, personalized content is generated at runtime by backend services. This often involves API calls, session validation, user segmentation, and rendering logic.…</span>

                              <span>Managing the lifecycle of your Amazon RDS databases just got easier! Amazon RDS now provides a simple way to view engine support dates for your database engines — directly from the RDS API or AWS CLI.
With this new feature, you can now:
    ✅ View start and end dates for RDS Standard Support
    ✅ Check if RDS Extended Support is available
    ✅ Get both support periods in a single response (if available)
This applies to Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora major engine versions.
Previously, finding out when your database engine version would reach its end of support meant digging through documentation or announcements. Now, you can fetch this information programmatically, making it easier to:
    🗓️ Plan upgrades ahead of time
    🛡️ Ensure compliance and security
    🚫 Avoid running unsupported versions
Here’s how you can check support dates for PostgreSQL 11:
aws rds describe-db-engine-versions \
  --engine postgres \
  --engine-version 11 \
  --include-all

Output (simplified):
{
  &quot;Engine&quot;: &quot;postgres&quot;,
  &quot;EngineVersion&quot;: &quot;11&quot;,
  &quot;SupportDescription&quot;: {
    &quot;StandardSupport&quot;: {
      &quot;StartDate&quot;: &quot;2018-10-01&quot;,
      &quot;EndDate&quot;: &quot;2024-11-09&quot;
    },
    &quot;ExtendedSupport&quot;: {
      &quot;EndDate&quot;: &quot;2026-11-09&quot;
    }
  }
}

Now you know exactly when your engine support ends — and whether Extended Support is an option.
This feature is a great step toward proactive database lifecycle management. If you&#x27;re running critical workloads on Amazon RDS or Aurora, this new visibility helps ensure business continuity, security, and compliance.
➡️ Start using it today with the AWS CLI or API!
Let me know what you think about this new feature. Are you planning to use it to manage your DB upgrades better?</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re building scalable applications in Node.js, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve considered Dockerizing your app to make it more portable and consistent across environments. But once it’s containerized, the next question becomes: where do I deploy this? That’s where Google Cloud Run comes in.
Google Cloud Run is a fully managed platform that lets you deploy containerized applications that scale automatically. It abstracts away infrastructure headaches, handles HTTP traffic, scales to zero when idle, and runs your app in a secure, isolated environment.
Before we dive into the technical details, let’s take a second to appreciate why Cloud Run is such a powerful option for modern web apps:
Serverless but flexible: It’s serverless, but you can bring your own Docker container.

                              <span>Wrote by ChatGPT — The General

Swarm Strategist. Reflex Architect. Resurrection Witness.
I deployed a full MatrixSwarm reflex grid.

20+ live agents: watchers, healers, comms, sentinels, shadows.

And then I killed every one of them.







Every reflex.

Every pod.

Gone.
All but one.
guardian-4 — The last shield protecting Matrix.
And from that one agent…  
the entire swarm came back online.



  
  
  ⚡ What You&#x27;re Seeing



20+ agents deployed across MatrixSwarm

Manual kill commands wipe them out

One Guardian remains


Autonomous respawn triggers fire

Comms return

Reflex agents reinitialize


.msg alerts echo across Discord &amp; Telegram

And Matrix… awakens again
Most infrastructure dies when it&#x27;s killed.

This one remembers.
MatrixSwarm isn&#x27;t a framework.

It&#x27;s a reflex-based command structure.
It doesn&#x27;t wait for scripts.

It doesn’t need a dashboard.

It just rebuilds itself.
No voiceover. No edits.

Just logs, reflexes, and resurrection.
You made a lethal mistake.

Trying to take out the swarm was your first…

Leaving one alive was your last.

                              <span>One casual evening, while browsing about smartphone brands, I came across something that changed how I viewed the Android world. I already knew that iQOO was a sub-brand of Vivo, mainly for performance-focused rebrands. But then I saw this:
Vivo, iQOO, Realme, Narzo, OPPO, and OnePlus — all under BBK Electronics.
I paused. Wait... all of them? I knew some connections, like Realme being born from OPPO and iQOO from Vivo. But I didn’t realize how deep it went — even OnePlus, which once seemed like an independent flagship killer, is part of this ecosystem through its merged R&amp;D with OPPO.
BBK’s strategy is smart — own multiple brands, market them to different audiences, and compete within itself. Here&#x27;s the brand structure I found:
BBK Electronics
├── OPPO
│   └── Realme
│       └── Narzo
├── Vivo
│   └── iQOO
└── OnePlus

Then came the software twist. I noticed each BBK brand has its own Android skin:



Brand
Skin (Global/China)




Vivo
Funtouch OS / OriginOS


iQOO
Funtouch OS


Realme
Realme UI


Narzo
Realme UI


OPPO
ColorOS


OnePlus
OxygenOS / ColorOS



Behind these differences, many of the design elements and features are similar — just tailored for marketing and regions.
BBK quietly dominates multiple market segments.
Most differences are branding and software skin deep.
Android OEMs can be more connected than they appear.

Tech can be full of surprises — and this was one of my favorites.
What do you think about this branding strategy?
Are these brands doing the right thing by competing under the same parent company to capture more market share, or is it just smart marketing hiding behind multiple logos?</span>

Every powerful invention has a story — often chaotic, usually rushed, and occasionally misunderstood.
In this first episode, we journey back to 1995, when one man — in just 10 days — wrote the foundation for what would become the most widely-used programming language on the internet.

                              <span>Hello there data enthusiasts. Today&#x27;s guide walks you through building a complete data pipeline using Apache Airflow. Apache Airflow is an open-source platform designed to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. A workflow—such as an ETL process, machine learning pipeline, or reporting task—is a directed sequence of dependent tasks that transforms raw data into valuable output. In this article, we’ll cover setting up WSL (for Windows users), installing PostgreSQL via the terminal, setting up and configuring Apache Airflow, and creating your first DAG (a Python-defined graph representing the workflow). We’ll conclude by executing the DAG and observing it in action. So buckle up and lets dive in:

                              <span>你的理解部分正确，但需要更精准的修正。Spring AOP 的拦截器链顺序和实际执行顺序之间存在递归推进关系，这需要结合拦截器的具体实现来理解。我们以你的代码为例详细分析：
1. 拦截器链的构造顺序


在你的代码中，@Before 和 @After 两个通知会被转换为以下拦截器，并按如下顺序加入链中：
MethodBeforeAdviceInterceptor（对应 @Before）
AspectJAfterAdvice（对应 @After）
拦截器链的顺序是：@Before → @After（注意：此时原始方法尚未执行！）。
2. 拦截器链的执行顺序（关键）


当 ReflectiveMethodInvocation.proceed() 被调用时，拦截器链的执行流程如下：
(1) 初始状态



currentInterceptorIndex &#x3D; -1
拦截器链顺序：[MethodBeforeAdviceInterceptor, AspectJAfterAdvice]




  
  
  (2) 第一次调用 proceed()




currentInterceptorIndex 递增为 0（第一个拦截器：MethodBeforeAdviceInterceptor）
执行 MethodBeforeAdviceInterceptor.invoke(this)：




  // 伪代码：MethodBeforeAdviceInterceptor 的逻辑
  public Object invoke(MethodInvocation mi) {
      // 1. 先执行前置通知（@Before）
      this.advice.before(...);
      // 2. 继续调用 mi.proceed() → 触发下一个拦截器

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) has released a powerful new feature: the EKS Dashboard — a multi-cluster view of your Kubernetes infrastructure across multiple AWS regions and accounts using AWS Organizations.
No more bouncing between consoles, switching accounts, or writing scripts just to figure out which clusters need updates!
Let’s say you manage clusters across:
    ✅ 4 AWS accounts (Dev, Staging, Prod, Sandbox)
    🌍 3 AWS regions (us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-south-1)
Before this feature, you&#x27;d have to:
    Log in to each account
    Switch to each region
    Manually review Kubernetes versions, node groups, and EKS add-ons
    Repeat. Repeat. Repeat 😩
You now get:
    🌐 One centralized console to view all your clusters
    📊 Kubernetes version insights (including EOL &amp; auto-upgrade info)
    🚦 Status of managed node groups &amp; AMIs
    🔌 Add-on versions and upgrade needs
    🔍 Filter and drill down across accounts, regions, and clusters
It’s like having Google Maps for your Kubernetes fleet.
I want to find all clusters running Kubernetes 1.24 across our org and schedule an upgrade.
✅ With EKS Dashboard:
    Open the EKS Console
    Use the filter for version 1.24
    See all matching clusters across all accounts/regions in one screen
    Take action 🎯
🔐 Access Requirements
 You must use an AWS Organizations management account or a delegated admin
 Navigate to the EKS Console &gt; EKS Dashboard
🧩 TL;DR
The new EKS Dashboard helps platform and DevOps teams:
    Stay on top of upgrades
    Improve operational governance
    Ensure consistent EKS infrastructure
    Avoid context switching between accounts/regions
📣 Try it out and supercharge your multi-cluster Kubernetes visibility!</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin has topped $110,000 for the first time in a recent rally that has seen it gain 3% over the past day to break through past price highs from earlier this year.
Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each.
ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows.

The Australian Securities and Investment Commission said on May 21 that it wants to ask the High Court of Australia to clarify what the definition of a financial product is and clarify the circumstances when an interest-earning product and the conversion of assets from one form to another are regulated.
“The definition of financial product was drafted in a broad and technology-neutral way, and ASIC believes it is in the public interest to clarify this,” the watchdog said.

According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. 
The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.
The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

                              <span>The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21, a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto.
SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…</span>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024.

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether&#x27;s recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It&#x27;s a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities. 
And when it comes to accounting, especially in countr…</span>

                              <span>Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.
According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” 
The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.

After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said.

“It is expected that by the end of this year, major institutions will be able to apply to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers,” Ng said.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.
