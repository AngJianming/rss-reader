                              <span>As software engineers, we live in a dependency-driven world. Whether they are libraries, open-source code, or frameworks, these dependencies often provide the boilerplate functionality, integrations with other platforms, and tooling that make our jobs a little easier.
But of course, one of the burdens of this dependency-driven world is that we are now at the mercy of our dependencies’ updates and schedules. Especially when we’ve added our own customizations and integrations on top.
One common dependency that I (and likely you) have crossed paths with is Salesforce. If Salesforce is part of your ecosystem, you’ve likely added a few of those customizations and integrations. And you’ve likely faced the problem of managing your customizations and integrations when Salesforce issues updates.

Open source software is the engine behind modern technology, yet its long-term sustainability is under threat due to funding challenges. This post delves into the history, core challenges, and emerging solutions for funding open source projects. We discuss key aspects like volunteer burnout, insufficient monetization, and lack of corporate support, and we explore innovative solutions such as sponsorship platforms and blockchain-based funding models. Through practical examples, insightful tables, and curated links, we offer a holistic view of the open source funding landscape and its future prospects.

                              <span>In this article, we’ll tackle the common challenges developers face when compiling Java code in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). If you&#x27;ve been working on a project, such as a learning English application without the internet, you might encounter compilation errors even if your Java version is updated.
Why Compilation Errors Happen in Java
Compilation errors in Java occur for various reasons, including incorrect project setup, missing dependencies, or Java syntax errors. They can be particularly frustrating when everything seems to be in order. In your case, working with VS Code adds another layer of complexity, as it requires proper configuration to recognize installed Java versions and libraries.

It&#x27;s crucial for the company I work for, too, affecting both cost and user experience.  I&#x27;ve been regularly performing and publishing cloud VM CPU comparisons to share my insights. Although my primary tool is my own DKbench suite, I tend to include Geekbench 5 in the comparison, mostly due to the abundance of available published results. This is despite Geekbench 6 being available for some time now. You might wonder why I haven&#x27;t switched: Simply put, I found that Geekbench 6 multi-core is fundamentally &quot;broken&quot;, and I thought I&#x27;d explain why.
Geekbench 6 barely scales on multi-core systems. This is unlike Geekbench 5, which, although not linear at scaling, continuously benefits from additional …</span>

                              <span>C# 14 enhances its elegant null-safety tools by allowing null-conditional operators ?. and ?[] to appear on the left-hand side of assignment expressions.
This new capability removes repetitive null checks and brings a new level of composability and safety to common mutation patterns in object graphs and collections.
In this post, you’ll explore:
What is null-conditional assignment
What&#x27;s new in C# 14
Real-world usage examples
Supported assignment operations
Limitations and best practices
Before C# 14, you needed explicit null checks before assigning to a property:
if (customer is not null)
{
    customer.Order &#x3D; GetCurrentOrder();
}

Or use a ternary:
customer?.Order &#x3D; customer is not null ? GetCurrentOrder() : null;

Both approaches were verbose or redundant.
Now you can write:
customer?.…</span>

                              <span>C# 14 pushes partial type support further by allowing constructors and events to be declared as partial members. This change empowers modularity and source generator scenarios, enabling more powerful abstractions in complex systems and large codebases.
In this post, you’ll learn:
What new partial members are allowed in C# 14
How to define partial constructors and events
How to use partial types with primary constructors
Best practices and caveats to avoid runtime surprises
Previously, partial members were limited to methods, properties, and indexers. C# 14 adds:
Partial constructors
Partial events
These new members allow for separation of responsibilities across files or teams — great for large projects, generated code, or layered architectures.
You can now split a class constructor across…</span>

Определить, является ли корректным заполнение доски Судоку размером 9×9. Проверять нужно только заполненные клетки по следующим правилам:
Каждая строка должна содержать цифры от 1 до 9 без повторений.


Каждый столбец должен содержать цифры от 1 до 9 без повторений.


Каждый из девяти блоков размером 3×3 должен содержать цифры от 1 до 9 без повторений.

Очевидно, что придётся пройти по каждой клетке хотя бы один раз. При обходе каждой клетки следует проверить следующие условия:
1) Если клетка пуста, переходим к следующей.
2) Если клетка заполнена, проверяем, что в ней записано число от 1 до 9. В противном случае доска Судоку считается некорректной.

Purpose




log_model
Stores model in MLflow tracking server with experiment metadata


save_model
Saves model to local filesystem only without tracking



log_model integrates with experiment tracking, save_model is standalone storage.

                              <span>C# 14 brings a new level of flexibility and readability to lambda expressions by allowing parameter modifiers like ref, out, in, and scoped in untyped parameter lists.
Previously, to use any modifier, you had to explicitly declare the parameter types. Now, the compiler infers the types while still allowing these powerful modifiers — reducing verbosity in functional programming constructs and delegate definitions.
In this post, you’ll learn:
What modifiers can be used with lambda parameters
What changed in C# 14
Examples with ref, out, and scoped

Use cases and best practices
Modifiers required full type declarations:
TryParse parser &#x3D; (string text, out int result) &#x3D;&gt; int.TryParse(text, out result);

Modifiers are allowed with implicitly typed parameters:

In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

Solana’s stablecoin supply rose by 156% in 2025, to hit a new record at $12 billion.

Solana’s TVL grew by 25% to $7.65 billion, with 27.7% decentralized exchange volume share, leading Ethereum and BNB Chain.

SOL price formed a bull flag, with a price target at $220.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL) failed to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching $156 on April 25, but an assortment of data points suggests that the altcoin’s upside is not over.

                              <span>New Hampshire became the first US state to allow its government to invest in crypto currencies including Bitcoin (BTC), after Governor Kelly Ayotte signed a bill passed by the legislature into law. 
In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.
“The Live Free or Die state is leading the way in forging the future of commerce and digital assets,” said New Hampshire Republicans in a May 6 X post.

The asset manager sees BNB’s price rising to approximately $1,275 per token by the end of 2025 and as high as $2,775 by the end of 2028, according to the research report. 
As of May 6, BNB trades at nearly $600 per coin, for a fully diluted value (FDV) of approximately $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

In the simplest terms:

A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your co…</span>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum&#x27;s rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum&#x27;s real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …</span>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to US President Donald Trump’s “ownership of crypto” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee Chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.

During an interview with Rug Radio published on May 5, Zhao said that he expects Bitcoin to reach up to one million dollars during this market cycle. He also highlighted the role of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this rise, saying that the increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin is a good thing for the market:
“There’s the ETFs. There’s this institutionalization of Bitcoin [ … ] it’s a positive in terms of price action, obviously. Our bags are up  —  not the alt‑coins as much, but at least Bitcoin is.”

Analysis: Bitcoin, crypto “largely directionless”
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC price momentum stalling at $95,000 before the latest daily close.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

                              <span>While blockchain infrastructure may be ready for institutional use, many legal teams at big firms remain cautious about fully integrating the technology. 
At the Token2049 event in Dubai, DoubleZero founder and former Solana head of strategy Austin Federa told Cointelegraph that today’s high-performance blockchains like Solana are technically capable of supporting large-scale institutional usage. However, lawyers need to catch up. 
“Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”
Federa added that institutional lawyers and compliance teams are still addressing regulatory concerns. The executive said this may slow adop…</span>

                              <span>Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) HydraDAO claims that its researchers were able to use a novel technique to repair severed spines in rats.
In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.

The post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting.

Berkshire holds $347B in cash, enough to buy ~18% of Bitcoin’s supply.

Greg Abel has not signaled a shift from Warren Buffett’s anti-Bitcoin stance.

Berkshire already has indirect crypto exposure via Nu Holdings, Jefferies.

Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting on May 3 that he will step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel taking over. This transition raises speculation about Berkshire’s financial capacity to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) under the new leadership.

Originally launched in October 2024 on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, Paws exploded in popularity with its ultra-simple tap-to-earn concept. Think of it as a gamified rewards engine embedded directly in Telegram, where users rack up points by completing tasks, referring others and interacting with mini-game elements.

He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”
