Bitcoin whales are adding to their BTC positions while price ranges below all-time highs.

If a new market correction comes, one potential bounce level lies in the mid-$90,000 zone.

Hyperliquid trader James Wynn hints at large-volume traders shaping low-timeframe price performance.

Bitcoin (BTC) may only see support at $94,000 if a fresh BTC price correction ensues, new analysis says this week.
In its latest X commentary, Keith Alan, cofounder of trading resource Material Indicators, pointed to a Bitcoin bounce zone at the 21-week moving average.

Bitcoin whales jump in amid “consolidating” price

                              <span>Sui-based decentralized exchange Cetus may be one step closer to recovering funds lost in a recent exploit, pending the outcome of a community governance vote scheduled to end June 3.
Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.
The vote is part of a broader recovery plan that includes using Cetus’s treasury and securing an emergency loan from the Sui Foundation.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

“They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

                              <span>The International Monetary Fund said it has reached an agreement with El Salvador to pay the country $120 million following an initial review of its $1.4 billion loan agreement struck last year.
The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the deal, El Salvador will need to fulfill its prior obligations around limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin (BTC), and it will have to cease its involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July.
“On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said.
The planned payout, subject to IMF executive board approval, is part of a larger $1.4 billion, 40-month loan deal struck in December, which saw El Salvador agree to confine its Bitcoin ambiti…</span>

The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. 
“I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said.
“I’ve always wanted to hear from my fellow commissioners about what makes sense to them, and there are many things that they’ve convinced me of…</span>

“We have to restrain ourselves from that instinct and attempt by our colleagues — both sides of the aisle,” he added.

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.
Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

                              <span>Mental health has become a major talking point in the construction and trade industries across Australia. For years, the tough-it-out culture among tradies meant mental wellbeing often took a backseat. But times are changing. Today, more and more Aussie tradies and employers are acknowledging that mental health is just as important as physical safety on the job.
In this article, we dive into how the trades are taking mental health seriously, what challenges workers face, and the support systems making a real difference.
Why Mental Health Matters in the Trades?
For tradies, the job can be physically demanding, fast-paced, and mentally exhausting. Long hours, tight deadlines, unpredictable weather, and job insecurity can all take a toll. Many tradies also work in isolation or small teams, wh…</span>

                              <span>Running a WordPress website entails more than just establishing it and then leaving it alone. Like any digital asset, your WordPress site requires regular care and attention to ensure it performs optimally, stays secure, and delivers a seamless experience for visitors. Ignoring basic maintenance tasks can lead to issues like slow loading speeds, outdated content, broken links, security vulnerabilities, and even complete site crashes.
One of the most critical tasks in your WordPress maintenance plan is regularly backing up your website. Backups ensure that you can restore your site to a previous version without losing valuable data in case of a crash, hack, or accidental deletion.
Best Practices:
Schedule automatic daily or weekly backups depending on how often your site is updated.

                              <span>One of the most effective ways to learn Java is through hands-on projects. Creating a simple to-do list application helps beginners not only grasp basic Java syntax but also enhances their understanding of graphical interfaces, object-oriented programming, and simple data storage. This article explains how to build a basic to-do list app step by step using Java.
Project Overview
Preparation
Task Structure Design
User Interface Design
After a user inputs a task and clicks the &quot;Add&quot; button, the task is added to the list. Clicking on a task and then pressing &quot;Delete&quot; removes it, while clicking &quot;Complete&quot; changes its status. These actions are managed through event listeners, and the task display updates in real time based on user interaction.
Program Logic and Interaction
To improve usability, the app can be enhanced to save tasks to a local file and automatically load them when the application starts. This feature ensures users won’t lose their tasks after closing the app and can be implemented using Java’s file I/O classes.
Conclusion
Building a simple Java to-do list application is a great way to practice core programming skills such as object-oriented design, event handling, GUI development, and data manipulation. Although this is a small project, it effectively demonstrates how Java can be used to build desktop applications. If you wish to expand the functionality, you can add features like task categories, due dates, or priority levels to create a more powerful task manager.</span>

Conclusion

Most AWS architects and developers create and use IAM roles but do not understand how the permissions described in the policies attached to a role are assigned to principals. The permissions assigned to the principal are always temporary and short-lived. These short-lived credentials are generated by AWS Security Token Service (STS), but wait – what ensures that the right principals assume a role? In this article we will look at AWS Trust Policy, the security gatekeeper that ensures that the right principal can assume a role to perform its actions.

It was a chilly Tuesday morning. I pushed what I thought was a “harmless” update to a legacy payment module—half-commented in a language no one speaks anymore (possibly Elvish?). An hour later, our production server began throwing errors like it was auditioning for a disaster movie.
That’s the day I truly understood why code quality and automated testing matter. And that’s the day I almost fled tech to become a barista.
Code quality is like personal hygiene—if you don’t maintain it, things get gross fast. Sure, it technically still works, but no one wants to be near it.
Great code is readable, maintainable, testable, and doesn’t make the next developer cry. Bad code? You’ll know it. It’s the kind with 12 nested if statements, variables named x1 through x7, a…</span>

Now we build MVPs to maybe survive the quarter.
This isn’t a post about how everything used to be better. It’s just an observation — and maybe a quiet protest — about how easy it is to confuse activity for progress when the rituals of delivery become more important than the value delivered.
Somewhere along the way, we started measuring the number of tickets closed instead of whether anything actually got better.
We replaced architecture with story points.
We replaced meaningful iteration with ceremonies so performative they deserve their own Oscars category.
We got really good at “velocity” and forgot that shipping garbage faster is not the same as improvement.
“Deliver working software.”

Remember that one? It used to be a principle.
Now it’s just something you hear right before someone tells you they’re rewriting a service because the old one was written in the “wrong” language.
I’m not saying waterfall was better.

I’m saying we’ve swung too far the other way.
Where once we spent six months planning a login form, now we spend six months pretending not to plan anything — and somehow end up with three frontends, five services, and nothing reusable.
Every generation of devs thinks they’re the first to see the mess.

But we’ve been here before. And we’ll be here again. The best we can do is notice it earlier, name it honestly, and maybe do a little less damage next time.

You land in 1985.
Could you still be a 10x dev?
This article explores what tools, languages, and programming philosophies actually stand the test of time, and what that says about the choices we make today.

We’ve been taught to code like engineers.
Precise. Rigid. Structured.
But what if that’s the wrong metaphor?
What if software isn’t something we “construct”…
cultivate?
Let me convince you:
Software is a garden. You are a gardener.
radically change how you write, maintain, and love your code.
When we treat coding like engineering, we expect:
Clean blueprints before we start
Predictable timelines
One-time builds and handoffs
Finite scopes and exact specs
But real-world software:
Evolves constantly
Breaks in unexpected places
Is abandoned, revived, forked, reused
Never really “finishes”
Software behaves more like a living t…</span>

SharpLink Gaming establishes the first ETH treasury, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. 

Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. 

Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury company.
Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire Bitcoin (BTC).

The incident comes amid a string of kidnappings and ransom attempts targeting crypto investors and their loved ones, prompting additional security measures from investors and industry executives.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.
According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. 
He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time…</span>

In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

                              <span>Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services.
According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their B…</span>

Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears.

Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside.

Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s (BTC) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions.

“ [...] our alpha-generating Bitcoin accumulation strategies are designed to drive sustained outperformance relative to Bitcoin itself, which requires a new valuation framework,” Strive CEO Matt Cole said.

Bitcoin could turn parabolic if prices move above $115,000 to liquidate more than $7 billion in short positions.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit taking from BTC investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months
