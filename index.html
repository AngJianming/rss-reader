When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?
It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The firm said on X on May 9 that it was making the cryptocurrency available to more than 100 million customers, adding that “the movement is just beginning,” before signing off as “Steaktoshi.” 
The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said.

The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

                              <span>The 22-year-old developer of Zerebro, who apparently committed suicide during a livestream on May 4, is actually alive, according to a San Francisco news outlet that claims they spoke to Yu outside his family home. 
The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.
The Justice Department said Chhipa raised funds for the United Nations-designated terror organization through social media, receiving money online or traveling hundreds of miles to a…</span>

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs.

While these components are essential, they only represent part of the picture. Trading, particularly in competitive environments, also demands psychological resilience and emotional control.
This becomes particularly evident in trading tournaments, where pressure, time limits, and direct competition create a behavioral environment that tests more than just market knowledge. Success in such scenarios is not determined solely by the depth of one&#x27;s strategy, but by the ability to execute under stress.
In trading competitions, participants aren&#x27;t just battling the market—they&#x27;re also contending with one another. Public leaderboards, predefined timelines, and fixed capital allocations…</span>

Section 1: introduction the brain fog problem
Let’s be real for a sec most of us are drowning in digital clutter.
You open Notion to “organize” your notes and suddenly spend 45 minutes tweaking page aesthetics like you’re designing a landing page for a failed SaaS. You try Craft and get distracted by the beautiful UI because it’s basically Apple Notes with a Gatsby filter. Capacities? Promising, but slow. And you still can’t remember where you wrote that idea about “building an indie dev SaaS for LLM-powered cats.”
We’re knowledge workers in the age of information overload, and ironically, all our shiny productivity tools are making us feel… less productive.
Here’s the core problem: the…</span>

You&#x27;re in the middle of an API testing marathon, your team is growing, and suddenly you hit that dreaded Postman free plan limit. Whether it&#x27;s the 3-API cap, the measly 25 collection runs per month, or the collaboration restrictions that only allow 3 team members, these barriers can bring your development workflow to a screeching halt.
Postman has been the industry standard for years, but the API development landscape has evolved dramatically. Today&#x27;s teams need tools that scale with their projects, offer robust collaboration features, and don&#x27;t force you into premium plans just to handle basic workflows.
In this deep dive, we&#x27;ll explore seven powerful Postman alternatives that are changing the game for API development teams in 2025. And spoiler alert …</span>

Section 1: Intro the fall of a frontend darling
Once upon a time, every React dev and their dog was shipping sites with Next.js. It was clean. It was fast. It made static generation cool again. You threw your .mdx files into a pages/ directory, ran next build, and went on with your life. Need some SSR? BoomgetServerSideProps() had your back. Need an image optimizer? Already built-in. Life was good.
Then came the App Router.
 Then came React Server Components.
 Then came Middleware.
 Then came… existential dread.
Suddenly, what used to be a dev-friendly framework started feeling like a PhD thesis in distributed systems. Next.js started promising everything, but del…</span>

Introduction: rage quitting the cloud boss battle
If AWS were a video game boss, it would be the one with 27 different attack modes, a second health bar, and a $437 surprise invoice when you respawn. For years, Amazon Web Services was the obvious choice for developers powerful, scalable, and used by the big leagues. But now? A growing number of devs are hitting the eject button and exploring new terrain.
This article isn’t a salty rant from someone who got burned by CloudWatch fees (okay, maybe a little). It’s a real look at how AWS, once the darling of cloud infrastructure, is becoming less attractive especially for indie hackers, startups, and lean dev teams.

                              <span>TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is a versatile image format known for its high-quality and lossless compression. It is often widely used across various devices and platforms, particularly in professional photography, publishing, and graphic design.
Converting a lot of TIFF images to JPG can significantly reduce file size, making them easier to store and share without compromising too much on quality.
In this article, I’ll guide you through the process of using Java to convert TIFF files to JPG format with JDeli, ensuring your images are accessible.  JDeli is the best enterprise-level Java image library for quick development.
Download the JDeli trial jar.
Process image if needed (scale, sharpen, lighten, watermark, etc)
Write out BufferedImage as JPG image file




BufferedImage bufferedImage &#x3D; JDeli.read(new File(&quot;tiffImageFile.tiff&quot;));
// Read TIFF image into Java

bufferedImage &#x3D; operations.apply(BufferedImage bufferedImage);
// Process TIFF image (Optional)

JDeli.write(bufferedImage, &quot;jpg&quot;, new File(&quot;jpgImageFile.jpg&quot;));
// Write out BufferedImage as JPEG image file

With the JDeli.convert() method you can save TIFF as JPG in just one line of code.
JDeli.convert(File inFile, File outFile);

JDeli.convert(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream, &quot;jpg&quot;);

byte[] outputData &#x3D; JDeli.convert(byte[] inputData, &quot;jpg&quot;);

You can specify an EncoderOptions object with this option to configure output settings like image compression.
JDeli.convert(File inFile, EncoderOptions outputOptions, File outfile);

Command line or bash, bat, and PowerShell scripts can be used to mass convert TIFF to JPG. This method also allows JDeli to be invoked from any programming language that supports creating a child process.
java -jar jdeli.jar –convert jpg &quot;inputFileOrDir&quot; &quot;outputDir&quot;

In this tutorial you learned how to bulk convert TIFF to JPG in bulk, our Java Image library JDeli also has TIFF support for reading and writing, which you can learn more about on our support site.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Building a Flutter app on a Mac can be a delightful experience if everything goes smoothly. However, it’s not uncommon to encounter errors while running the flutter run command, which can halt your development process. In this guide, we will address how to resolve common Flutter run command errors you might face during setup, particularly on macOS.
Understanding the Issue
When you encounter an error running the flutter run command, it&#x27;s often due to several potential issues. This includes misconfigured Flutter SDK paths, missing dependencies, or issues with your iOS or Android emulators. The error message displayed in your terminal can provide insight into what went wrong.
Some possible errors might include:
Flutter SDK not found.

During my journey learning Elixir, I discovered Ecto, a powerful database wrapper and query generator that enables seamless interaction with SQL databases. While often compared to ORMs like Entity Framework Core or Ruby on Rails&#x27; ActiveRecord, Ecto diverges by avoiding automatic state tracking, requiring developers to manage changes explicitly. This article explores Ecto&#x27;s core concepts, including repositories, schemas, migrations, and CRUD operations. For advanced features, refer to Ecto’s official documentation.
Ecto is a database wrapper and query generator for Elixir, designed to work with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL. It provides:
Map database tables to Elixir structs (via schemas).
Generate type-safe queries using Elixir syntax.

Durante minha jornada de aprendizado em Elixir, descobri o Ecto, uma poderosa camada de abstração para bancos de dados e gerador de consultas que permite interagir com bancos SQL de forma intuitiva. Embora frequentemente comparado a ORMs como o Entity Framework Core ou o ActiveRecord do Ruby on Rails, o Ecto se diferencia por não rastrear automaticamente estados de entidades, exigindo que os desenvolvedores gerenciem mudanças de forma explícita. Este artigo explora conceitos fundamentais do Ecto, incluindo repositórios, schemas, migrações e operações CRUD. Para recursos avançados, consulte a documentação oficial do Ecto.

                              <span>Tech company Meta is reportedly exploring integrating stablecoin payments into its platforms after a three-year hiatus from cryptocurrencies, Fortune reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether&#x27;s USDt (USDT), Circle&#x27;s USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
&quot;Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

Whale accumulation continues, with the number of addresses holding 10,000+ XRP rising steadily on price dips.

XRP broke above a key falling wedge resistance, increasing the chances of a rally toward $2.80–$3.66.

XRP’s (XRP) price gained 7.50% on May 8 to reach an intraday high of $2.27, mirroring similar upside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

                              <span>Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

                              <span>Missouri House Bill 594, a bill that would eliminate capital gains tax in the US state, has passed a vote in the state House of Representatives and now heads to Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe&#x27;s desk for signature.
According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

                              <span>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 price level for the first time since January, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment among investors.
Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

                              <span>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky will probably be allowed to travel for his daughter’s wedding regardless of the outcome of his May 8 sentencing hearing.
In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.
