Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra during a May 12 press conference that Charlton would be the new assistant minister for science, technology and the digital economy, working with Tim Ayres, the minister for industry and innovation. 
Ayres and Charlton will administer policies and programs promoting advancements in emerging technologies, science, technology, innovation and the digital economy, according to Albanese.

Jenner had escaped a class-action lawsuit from buyers of her self-titled memecoin, Caitlyn Jenner (JENNER) after California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. said in a motion filed on May 9 that it was “sufficient to conclude that all nine causes of action are deficient” and sided with Jenner in dismissing the suit in its entirety for failure to state a claim.
He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original.

                              <span>A British High Court has issued a restraining order against computer scientist Craig Wright, preventing him from filing further defamation suits. 
In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

The recent filing was part of the prosecutor’s request to sentence him to two years in prison over his role in the hack, which saw the SEC X account publish a false announcement that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was approved, shaking up the markets. 
Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.

Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval, will integrate the Mountain Protocol team, tech stack and licensing framework into Anchorage’s existing offerings, Anchorage said in a May 12 statement.
While terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, it reflects an accelerating number of acquisitions between crypto and TradFi firms in recent months.

Dogecoin&#x27;s 38% surge reflects strong market demand, with spot-buyer volumes taking charge since March. 

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.

Dogecoin&#x27;s (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). 
The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been &quot;taker bu…</span>

MongoDB offers powerful tools to simplify data access and improve performance. Among these tools are Standard Views and Materialized Views, two approaches that allow you to shape how data is read and presented, each with its own trade-offs and use cases.
In this article, we’ll explore the differences between the two and when to use each effectively.
I created a small Node.js server to compare between them and guide you how to create and refresh both programmatically, Find it here.
So, you&#x27;re working with MongoDB and hear about these &quot;view&quot; things. Are they the same? Not quite.
A MongoDB Standard View (or MongoDB View) is essentially a saved query (aggregation pipeline). It acts like a virtual collection. When you query the view, MongoDB runs the saved query against the real c…</span>

A Bloom Filter is a probabilistic data structure used to test set membership. It’s:
Space-efficient ✅
Extremely fast ✅
Allows false positives ❌
Never has false negatives ✅
You can ask: &quot;Is element X in the set?&quot; and it will either say:
Definitely not
Possibly yes
It trades 100% accuracy for massive space and time savings.



Use Case
Why Bloom Filter?




Caches (e.g., CDN, Memcached)
Avoid unnecessary DB hits for missing keys


Web crawlers
Don&#x27;t reprocess already seen URLs


Spell-checkers
Fast word lookup with compact storage


Distributed systems (e.g., Bigtable, Cassandra)
Avoid cross-node calls for missing data


Blockchain (Bitcoin/SPV)
Verify transactions without full node

                              <span>In Laravel projects or any large scale PHP application it&#x27;s common to create helper files that contain reusable functions. These helpers make your code cleaner and more efficient.
But there&#x27;s a common issue, defining the same function more than once will cause a Fatal error..
What&#x27;s the problem?
If the same function is declared twice, PHP will throw an error like this:
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare function_name()
This often happens because of:
Repeated includes:


Package conflicts:



The safe solution
To prevent this issue, wrap your helper functions like this:
if (!function_exists(&#x27;sayHello&#x27;)) {
    function sayHello() {
        return &#x27;Hello!&#x27;;
    }
}

This way, if the function already exists, PHP will skip redefining it, and your app will keep running smoothly.
In Laravel projects
Even with Laravel’s powerful autoloading and service container, this pattern is essential. It keeps your project safe from unexpected conflicts and ensures maximum compatibility especially when working with custom helpers or external packages.
Summary:

Course Recommendation
For using a course to learn the topics and materials, I strongly recommend Adrian Cantrill. Adrian’s courses are very detailed. He goes over the actual services and how they work, their limitations, use cases, and how they interact with other services to architect business needs.
Furthermore, the courses offered by Adrian contain ample hands-on labs that help solidify the topics you have just learned. Additionally, there is often “exam power-ups” mentioned in the course which are key items to pay attention to when giving conside…</span>

OAuth has become the standard protocol for authorization across web and mobile applications. However, with two major versions—OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0—developers often wonder about the differences and which one suits their application best. In this blog, we’ll break down the key differences between OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0, especially in the context of .NET Core development. Whether you&#x27;re integrating third-party logins or securing your APIs, understanding these protocols will help you make informed security choices.

                              <span>Aave, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has reached a new record of funds onchain, according to data from DefiLlama.
In an X post, Aave said it topped $40.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) on May 12. Onchain data reveals that Aave v3, the latest version of the protocol, has approximately $40 billion in TVL. 
Aave is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users borrow cryptocurrency by depositing other types of cryptocurrency as collateral. Meanwhile, lenders earn yield from borrowers. 
“With these milestones, Aave is proving its dominance in the Lending Space,” DeFi analyst Jonaso said in a May 12 X post. TVL represents the total value of cryptocurrency deposited into a protocol’s smart contracts.

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

                              <span>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced partnerships between the city and financial firms as part of his crypto plans.
In a May 12 press conference at Gracie Mansion, the city’s official mayoral residence, Adams said June Ou, founder of financial services company Figure, and Richie Hecker, CEO of private equity firm Traction and Scale, would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts. He spoke of Ou and Hecker acting as advisers for New York City’s next steps in “economic development and opportunities to serve the public using digital assets.” 
“We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding:

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…</span>

On May 9, BlackRock updated the registration statement for its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). The revised version addressed potential risks to the integrity of the Bitcoin network posed by quantum computing, the filing shows.
“[I]f quantum computing technology is able to advance […] it could potentially undermine the viability of many of the cryptographic algorithms used across the world’s information technology infrastructure, including the cryptographic algorithms used for digital assets like bitcoin,” BlackRock said.

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. 
Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lap via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.

                              <span>Bitcoin mining firm American Bitcoin is going public through a merger with crypto mining company Gryphon Digital Mining, the companies announced on May 12.
Under the terms of the deal, Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction. After the merger, the new company will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and be led by its board of directors, which includes Eric Trump, the second-eldest of US President Donald Trump’s three sons. 
News of the merger coincided with a sharp rise in Gryphon Digital Mining’s stock price, which climbed from $0.52 on May 9 to $2.15 at the time of writing, a gain of more than 313%, according to Google Finance.
The announcement follows early April reports that American Bitcoin was considering an initial public offering (…</span>

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

                              <span>A 90-day tariff agreement between the US and China may set the stage for a broader recovery of stock and cryptocurrency markets, as investors look ahead to a potential tax relief package.
The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”
