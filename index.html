Being Student Preparing for highly competitive technical internships at top tech companies like Adobe, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others can be overwhelming. Aspiring candidates often struggle to understand the exact skill requirements, the nuances of the interview process, and how to build a structured, personalized study plan. This leads to wasted effort on irrelevant topics, missed application windows, and high stress levels.
To solve this, I built the Big Tech Intern Prep Agent, an autonomous AI workflow powered by Runner H. Starting from a single, detailed prompt, this agent researches a specific internship role at a leading tech company (e.g., Adobe Software Engineer Intern), analyzes the job requirements, studi…</span>

                              <span>🚀 Introduction
SRE is a discipline that blends software engineering and operations to ensure that production systems run smoothly with minimal downtime. Originally pioneered by Google, SRE has now become a standard practice in modern DevOps teams.
In this article, we’ll break down the key principles, tools, and techniques of SRE and how it can help companies build highly resilient systems.
🚀 Core Principles of SRE
🚀 Major Tools &amp; Technologies in SRE
🚀 Monitoring &amp; Observability
🚀 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
🚀 CI/CD &amp; Automation
🚀 Chaos Engineering
🚀 Real-World Impact of SRE
For instance, Google&#x27;s SRE team makes sure that Google Search is available 99.999% of the time, showcasing the capability of proactive reliability management.
🚀 Getting Started with SRE?
If reliability engineering is your serious business, ongoing learning and experimentation are the name of the game!
🚀 Last Thoughts
As businesses keep growing, SRE will become even more important in delivering seamless, unbroken user experiences. Whether you&#x27;re a budding SRE or a DevOps practitioner, becoming an SRE expert will make you stand out in today&#x27;s fast-paced tech industry.
Want to embark on your SRE journey? Let&#x27;s get connected and talk about all things monitoring, automation, and reliability! 🚀</span>

                              <span>Scalability is always a big consideration when building applications and while PHP often gets underestimated in this area, it’s still powering huge systems worldwide.
How do you approach scalability in your PHP projects?
Here are a few discussion prompts:
🏗 Architecture – Do you prefer microservices, modular monoliths, or something else when scaling PHP?
🧰 Frameworks/Tools – What PHP frameworks or tools have helped you scale (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, RoadRunner)?
💽 Databases &amp; Caching – What strategies do you use to prevent bottlenecks (e.g., Redis, read replicas, horizontal scaling)?
🧪 Testing &amp; Deployment – How do you maintain test coverage and deploy large PHP apps safely?
🔍 Lessons Learned – Any real-world challenges or “a-ha!” moments while scaling a PHP system?
Let’s swap tips, war stories, and best practices — whether you&#x27;re running a startup or managing a massive legacy codebase.

                              <span>The landscape of business automation is undergoing a profound transformation, moving beyond the simple automation of repetitive tasks to a new era of &quot;hyperautomation.&quot; This evolution is driven by the powerful synergy between Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). While RPA has long been a cornerstone for streamlining rule-based, high-volume processes, its capabilities have traditionally been limited when confronted with unstructured data or tasks requiring cognitive discernment.
Enter Generative AI, a revolutionary form of artificial intelligence capable of understanding, creating, and reasoning with complex, unstructured information. By combining RPA&#x27;s execution prowess with GenAI&#x27;s cognitive abilities, organizations are unlocking &quot;Intelligent Au…</span>

As a computer science student nearing my senior year, I&#x27;ve been fascinated by the progression of software architecture. From monolithic designs to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and now to the widely adopted microservices model, each evolution has sought to overcome contemporary challenges, advancing software engineering towards improved efficiency, flexibility, and reliability. In my academic and practical endeavors, microservices—with their benefits like independent deployment, technological variety, and elastic scalability—have made a strong impression on me. Yet, microservices are not a panacea; they introduce new complexities along with their advantages. Choosing a suitable framework to navigate this microservices environment has been a key focus of …</span>

As a junior in computer science, I embarked on a project last semester to build a campus second-hand trading platform. This led me to discover the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was at a crossroads, needing a framework robust enough for peak end-of-semester trading and simple enough for a Rust novice like me to grasp quickly. Hyperlane didn&#x27;t just meet my expectations; it exceeded them. I&#x27;m excited to share my journey with this impressive framework.

My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its Context (or ctx). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically l…</span>

Sodium is more abundant on Earth than lithium, and batteries that use the material could be cheaper in the future. Building a new battery chemistry is difficult, mostly because lithium is so entrenched. But, as I’ve noted before, this new technology has…</span>
