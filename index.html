In a May 18 X post, the Bybit China Team said it received reports about users experiencing withdrawal restrictions on the Bybit platform due to a KYC verification anomaly when logging in with an Apple ID. The team claimed to have immediately responded and taken action involving multiple departments, including the firm’s chief operating officer, Helen Liu.
Other people involved in the operation were the heads of customer service, risk control, the Chinese-language division, product managers and the technical team. The exchange coordinated its actions with the user.

Bitcoin dropped over 4.5% on May 19, confirming a bearish divergence and threatening a break below $100,000.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. 

A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation.

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader&#x27;s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. 
Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet…</span>

                              <span>A recent proposal that aims to change Bitcoin’s base unit to make it easier to understand as a payment tool has run into opposition, with critics saying Bitcoin’s satoshis are no more confusing than the dollar’s cents. 
Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

                              <span>A group of Coinbase users from Illinois have filed a class-action lawsuit against the crypto exchange, alleging that its identity checks violate the state’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).
Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

Bitcoin is now less than 3% away from its peak price and has gained 2% over the past 24 hours to trade around $104,730 at the time of writing.

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) said in a May 18 statement that it seized nearly 25 Bitcoin (BTC), alongside the mansion and car, which are together worth a total of 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million).
The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company.

Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

Meet Sam, our fictional senior developer. You may remember them from their first adventure exploring AWS S3 storage classes ☁️ or their reluctant encounter with AWS Cognito 🔐.
Sam had just closed their fifth GitHub issue of the morning, all of them some variation of “Thanks for reporting!” or “We’ll look into it soon 🫣.” Copy, paste, rephrase, repeat — across three different repositories. It was the kind of thing that made them question their life choices — and wonder if they should’ve just opened that dog daycare center instead. Somewhere in the middle of googling “automate GitHub issue responses without losing your soul” 😩, they found it: Probot. A framework for building GitHub Apps.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a term out there in the AI community today that everybody&#x27;s using: Multimodal RAG.

Let&#x27;s get this &quot;RAG&quot; out of the way before we dive into Multimodal RAG. RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Think of it like this: &quot;Go find some helpful info, mix it with what you know, and then give me a smart answer.&quot;
Here&#x27;s the deal - you know those AI chatbots like ChatGPT that seem super smart?
Well, they&#x27;ve learned tons of stuff, but they have some problems. Sometimes their knowledge is outdated, or when you ask about something really specific, they just shrug and say &quot;Sorry, no idea.&quot; That&#x27;s where RAG comes to the rescue. Before the AI answers you, it acts like a detective.
It searches through fresh databases, company documents, maybe even the internet, to find the most up-to-date …</span>

Introducing Appwrite Sites. 
A new Appwrite product that lets you deploy and host your websites and web apps right inside Appwrite. No more juggling services. No more gluing things together. No more multiple subscriptions. Just build, deploy, and go live. All in one place, and it&#x27;s 100% open source, the kind that lets you (really) self-host and (really) own your data.
Appwrite has always been about giving you the tools you need to build fast, secure, and modern apps. However, while Appwrite has always worked hard to deliver a great backend experience, one big piece was missing: web hosting.

☁️ Cloud Platforms – AWS and Azure
✅ Key Accomplishments:
✅ Launched and configured virtual machines (instances) on AWS.
✅ Learned to create EC2 instances on AWS and manage key configurations.
✅ Successfully connected to AWS instances using SSH via private .pem key files.
⚠️ Major Challenge (And Proud Moment):
To solve this:
I shared the .pem file from Windows to Ubuntu.
Used Add Location via file manager, input the system IP, and securely moved the .pem file.
In VirtualBox, I used Shared Folders to manage file access between host and VM.
This took almost 2 days of research and troubleshooting, but I cracked it! 💪
🔐 SSH, Linux, and Shell Scripting
💻 Linux Commands Mastered:
ls -ltr, cat, touch, cd, pwd – navigation and file handling
nproc – check CPU cores

Have you ever thought of scrolling for just 15 minutes but ended up wasting your whole afternoon? If yes, then you are not the only one. At some point, all of us have felt submissive to social media. It’s so addictive that once you start, there is no end to it.
Social media is now part of our routine. Before, people would begin their day with a walk or some quiet time, but now, the first thing most do is look at their phone. There are 5.24 billion active social media users across the globe, which makes up approximately 64% of the world population.
Social Media is a great source of entertainment, it has made connecting with people so easy. But everything has pros and cons; apart from enjoyment, it also affects the mental health of the users. Especially t…</span>

Castle Dynamic Proxy is a powerful library for generating dynamic proxy objects at runtime in .NET. It is widely used in mocking frameworks like Moq to simulate and intercept the behavior of objects during testing.
In mocking scenarios, Dynamic Proxy allows developers to create fake implementations of interfaces or virtual methods. These proxy objects can:
By enabling such features, Castle Dynamic Proxy plays a key role in unit testing, dependency isolation and aspect-oriented programming(AOP) in the .NET ecosystem.
What&#x27;s a proxy?
What is an interception pipeline?
A simple example for Dynamic Proxy:
Note: If you implement an interceptor and handle the method, the method is handled. If you don&#x27;t handle it, nothing happens and it may return null.

                              <span>In FastAPI, how route handlers (endpoints) behave in terms of parallelism and concurrency depends on whether they are defined using async def or def, and whether the work inside them is I/O-bound or CPU-bound.

Here are the four combinations of route handlers and how they affect parallel or concurrent handling of requests:
async def with async I/O-bound work (e.g., await asyncio.sleep, database calls)





@router.get(&quot;/async-io&quot;)
async def async_io_route():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return {&quot;status&quot;: &quot;async io&quot;}

Handled concurrently
Non-blocking — multiple such requests can be handled at the same time.
Best performance for I/O tasks like DB queries, network calls, file access.
async def with CPU-bound work (e.g., heavy computation, no await)

Copyleft licenses have long served as an essential tool for ensuring software freedom while enabling commercial innovation. In this comprehensive guide, we explore the history, core principles, and mechanisms of copyleft licenses, detailing how they empower both open source communities and profit-driven businesses. We cover the evolution from the GNU GPL to modern commercial models like the Open Compensation Token License (OCTL), discuss legal and technical challenges, and predict future trends. With practical use cases, tables, and bullet lists that break down key points, this post provides a holistic view of how copyleft licenses continue to shape the software ecosystem.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.

&quot;You can&#x27;t &#x27;defend democracy&#x27; by destroying democracy. You can’t &#x27;fight election interference&#x27; by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both.&quot;

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…</span>

Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

One target demands $116,000 next week, moving BTC/USD firmly out of its narrow range.

A quick dip before continuing higher is among the options for BTC price action into the new week.

Bitcoin (BTC) reduced volatility to a minimum into the May 18 weekly close as traders bet on a fresh breakout.

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
&quot;We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.&quot;
The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the c…</span>

In an interview at Consensus 2025, the executive said that Pyth Network&#x27;s data pull model sets it apart from traditional pricing oracles, allowing customers to pay for data on demand, reducing costs for institutions reliant on real-time market data.

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…</span>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&amp;P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…</span>
