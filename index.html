GoLogin is an antidetect browser designed for developers who need to manage multiple browser profiles with unique digital fingerprints. Unlike traditional browsers, GoLogin allows you to create isolated browsing environments, each with distinct characteristics that help bypass browser fingerprinting detection.

The project is a web application built with Spring Boot and Angular. Initially, I went with a simple monolithic architecture, but as the requirements and ambitions grew, I had to switch to a microservices-based structure. Here&#x27;s how it all happened — including configurations, issues, and solutions.
Initial setup:
Backend: Spring Boot
Frontend: Angular
I already had a rented VDS, so I registered a domain via a well-known provider and decided to host the site on that VDS. To keep things simple, I integrated the Angular build into the Spring Boot resources using frontend-maven-plugin, bundling everything into a single JAR file.

Developers often face the challenge of fetching such structured content from third-party websites or apps. This is where restaurant APIs or ethical web scraping come into play.
In this post, we’ll explore how to build a Python-based scraper that tracks real-time menu changes, and discuss best practices around API integration, respecting robots.txt, and data structuring for user-facing restaurant apps.
This concept is especially helpful for developers working on food delivery, review platforms, or price comparison tools featuring brands like Cracker Barrel Menu (see more here). Let’s dive into the tech that brings your favorite dishes online—accurately and efficiently.</span>

                              <span>When translating documents, it&#x27;s easy to overlook something critical: formatting
It’s one thing to convert text from one language to another — it’s another to retain the original layout, structure, and visual clarity. Whether you’re working with PDFs, DOCX, Excel files, presentations, or subtitle formats, preserving formatting can make the difference between a usable output and a reformatting nightmare.
Here’s a value-focused overview of popular document translation tools that handle formatting reliably while supporting diverse file types and professional use cases. This guide highlights how each tool excels in specific scenarios — whether you’re a developer, researcher, localization manager, or simply someone handling multilingual files.

🔹 DOM Example:
const inputRef &#x3D; useRef();


🔹 Non-DOM Example:
const inputRef &#x3D; useRef();


🔹 Why It’s Useful:
Perfect for focus management, timers, or tracking previous values
🔥 Final Thought: useRef is like a tiny memory box inside your component—super handy and lightweight!</span>

It’s a deceptively simple task. And yet, it’s where many projects start to feel fragile.
Picture this: you&#x27;re building a microservice architecture that talks to a PostgreSQL database. You’re working with two other developers. You write a quick README:
“Make sure you have Postgres installed. Create a user, a password, a database. Import this SQL script. Use port 5432 unless it’s taken.”
You think it’s fine. Then the pull requests start rolling in with bugs that don’t make sense. Someone’s DB is misconfigured. Someone else forgot to run the schema script. Another person installed the wrong version of P…</span>
