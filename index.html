Yesterday, we automated syncing NGINX config files using Ansible. Today, we’ll crank it up a notch — let’s auto-provision SSL certificates with Let’s Encrypt using a battle-tested community role.
No more Certbot copy-paste rituals. 
No more forgetting cron jobs. Ansible’s got your back.
Roles in Ansible are reusable chunks of automation. 
Think of them like npm packages, but for infrastructure. 
They organize tasks, variables, files, templates, etc., into a standard structure. 
You just plug them into your playbook.…</span>

The example I used was my ReadABooker site, which encourages people to read more Booker Prize shortlisted novels (and to do so by buying them using my Amazon Associate links).
I’m slightly sad to report that in the five months since I implemented that change, visits to the website have remained pretty much static and I have yet to make my fortune from Amazon kickbacks. But that’s ok, we just use it as an excuse to learn more about SEO and to apply more tweaks to the website.
I’ve been using the most excellent ARefs site to get information about how good the on-page SEO is for many of my sites. Every couple of weeks, ARefs crawls the site and will give…</span>

Developers building front-end automations, data scraping pipelines, or site monitoring tools often need screenshots of web pages. Two main approaches can help you here: headless browsers and website screenshot APIs.
While both allow you to generate screenshots, they differ in setup, flexibility, scalability, and use cases. This article explores each, comparing real-world scenarios to help you choose the best solution for your needs.
A headless browser is a real browser running without a graphical user interface (GUI). Instead of clicking around manually, you control the browser with code. Popular tools include Puppeteer, Playwright, and Selenium.
These tools let you load web pages, interact with the DOM, wait for elements to appear, click buttons, fill forms, and finally tak…</span>

I built WP Email Ticketing, a WordPress plugin for customer support management. It leverages Postmark&#x27;s inbound email processing to seamlessly convert customer emails into support tickets within WordPress. This plugin allows users to manage and respond to these support tickets via email efficiently, all within the WordPress dashboard.

WP Email Ticketing
I often struggle with finishing side-projects. This time I had great results using AI as my Project Manager. I spent time upfront documenting my MVP idea and basic architecture. Then I had AI break down the implementation into clear, manageable phases. This structure kept even small coding sessions on track, and helped avoid hallucinations or chasing the wrong solutions.
Phase 1: WordPress Foundation
Phase 2: Email Handling
Phase 3: REST API
Phase 4: React Frontend
Backend: PHP with WordPress APIs for custom post types, metadata, attachments, and REST API endpoints.
Frontend: React and TypeScript for a modern, responsive admin interface.
Email Processing: Postmark&#x27;s inbound email API for seamless ticket creation. Send reply emails to customers using Postmark.
Build Tools: Composer for PHP dependency management and Vite for frontend bundling.
Postmark&#x27;s inbound email API was quite easy to integrate, thanks to the clear documentation. I used it to process incoming emails and convert them into WordPress custom post types for support tickets. I also setup Postmark integration for the outgoing emails.
I faced some issues with the authentication on the webhook URL which did not seem to work, probably a issue with my hosting provider.</span>

                              <span>This is a submission for the Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators.
I built WP Email Ticketing, a WordPress plugin for customer support management. It leverages Postmark&#x27;s inbound email processing to seamlessly convert customer emails into support tickets within WordPress. This plugin allows users to manage and respond to these support tickets via email efficiently, all within the WordPress dashboard.

WP Email Ticketing
I often struggle with finishing side-projects. This time I had great results using AI as my Project Manager. I spent time upfront documenting my MVP idea and basic architecture. Then I had AI break down the implementation into clear, manageable phases. This structure kept even small coding sessions on track, and helped avoid hallucinations or chasing the wrong solutions.
Phase 1: WordPress Foundation
Phase 2: Email Handling
Phase 3: REST API
Phase 4: React Frontend
Backend: PHP with WordPress APIs for custom post types, metadata, attachments, and REST API endpoints.
Frontend: React and TypeScript for a modern, responsive admin interface.
Email Processing: Postmark&#x27;s inbound email API for seamless ticket creation. Send reply emails to customers using Postmark.
Build Tools: Composer for PHP dependency management and Vite for frontend bundling.
Postmark&#x27;s inbound email API was quite easy to integrate, thanks to the clear documentation. I used it to process incoming emails and convert them into WordPress custom post types for support tickets. I also setup Postmark integration for the outgoing emails.
I faced some issues with the authentication on the webhook URL which did not seem to work, probably a issue with my hosting provider.</span>

                              <span>These days, I hear coders are busy debating whether AI is a “savior in work” or a “nightmare causing unemployment.”
“AI writes code too fast, I’m about to lose my job!”
Calm down, skilled coders!
AI does not take your job – it only handles repetitive, mechanical tasks well. To be frank, AI won’t make you unemployed; it’s your reluctance to learn, resistance to change, and stuck mindset as a “code monkey” that will knock you down.

Many still think: “I’m a dev &#x3D; I know how to code &#x3D; I’m safe.”
Then AI comes and hits the harsh truth: you’re just a typist, while AI types faster, with fewer bugs, and never takes a lunch break.
Software engineers are not typists – they are software developers, meaning they design and build solutions, not just copy-paste by command.

As a reminder, I wanted to use LLM&#x27;s to chat with my Jira ticket data, since that was all the hype in 2023-2024 thanks to the rise in popularity of chatgpt.  I knew my ticket data contained specific use cases from my loudest customers because they called me on the phone, but I wanted to know about everyone else.  
What questions were they asking?


What was my team missing?


What connections across the organization could be made to speed up research activities 


How could my team create more helpful FAQ documentation?  



I started this use case in January of 2024, using Claude V2.0 and Amazon Titan Text Embeddings and proceeded to spend the entirety of that year losing all faith that I could accurately chat with my data using Ama…</span>

                              <span>Today, I decided to build an AI Voice Assistant.  
My goal was to convert my voice to text, pass it through an LLM, and stream it back as audio - all within a few seconds in MacOS Terminal.
I was able to accomplish this quickly with help from GPT-4o.
We&#x27;ll build this using 3 OpenAI models:
 Whisper:  Speech -&gt; Text
 GPT:  LLM to Process Text
 TTS:  Text -&gt; Speech
If you don&#x27;t already have API keys, you can get them here:  https://openai.com/api
Before starting, you&#x27;ll need to export your OpenAI API Key for the commands to work.
export OPENAI_API_KEY&#x3D;sk-...

If you don&#x27;t want to use OpenAI models, there are plenty of alternatives (Open-Whisper, LM Studio, Piper, Claude, etc...).
Over the next minute, you can paste these commands into your MacOS Terminal:

Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a first of its kind tool for helping you automatically index API endpoints across all your repositories. LiveAPI helps you discover, understand and use APIs in large tech infrastructures with ease.
Meilisearch is a fast, open-source search engine that makes adding search to your app a breeze. One of its killer features is filtering, which lets you narrow down search results based on specific criteria. Whether you&#x27;re building an e-commerce site or a blog, filters are key to delivering relevant results. This guide dives deep into Meilisearch filters, with practical examples and tips to get you up and running.
We&#x27;ll cover how filters work, syntax, common use cases, and some gotchas to avoid. By the end, you…</span>

                              <span>When you&#x27;re building an Angular app, you&#x27;ll eventually need to use forms — for login, registration, feedback, or something else. In Angular, there are two main types of forms:
Template-driven forms
Reactive forms
Let’s go over each one in simple terms and look at some examples.
These forms are written mostly in the HTML template. Angular takes care of a lot behind the scenes. They’re great for simple use cases.
First, make sure to import FormsModule in your app.module.ts:
import { FormsModule } from &#x27;@angular/forms&#x27;;

@NgModule({
  imports: [FormsModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
