                              <span>Generative AI is excellent at analyzing large amounts of data and identifying and summarizing a meaningful subset of the data based on a guided set of instructions. The source of the data could be anything - your email inbox, a large text file on your machine or a webpage on the internet. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it can give you a head start on large tasks that involve a lot of data. One of the things I get asked about a lot by developers is how they can use AI to analyze video content. Multimodal LLMs have come a long way, but they&#x27;re not quite at the point where they could ingest an hour&#x27;s worth of video from a live stream and provide a summary or identify potential clips for sharing on social media. But there&#x27;s another approach that we can take to solve this problem.

Rust is often regarded as a systems programming language, but an increasing number of frameworks and practices demonstrate its suitability for full-stack web development:  
Tauri for cross-platform desktop applications


Leptos / Yew for frontend WebAssembly


Axum / Actix-web for backend services



Rust’s core design principles—memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and modern language features—make it excel in web development scenarios. The following sections elaborate, from an engineering practice perspective, on how Rust addresses common pain points in web development and brings unique advantages.  
Rust makes errors explicit through Result and prohibits implicit exceptions:

                              <span>As developers, our tools can make or break our workflow — and VS Code is one of the most powerful editors out there. Over the years, I’ve tested dozens of extensions, but only a handful have truly stuck. In this post, I’m sharing the 10 VS Code extensions that I genuinely use every day — the ones that boost my focus, code quality, and overall efficiency. Whether you&#x27;re just starting out or looking to optimize your setup, these picks might just change your workflow too. My favorites include: GitLens for visualizing Git history inline, Prettier to auto-format code consistently, Tabnine/Codeium for AI-assisted autocomplete, Error Lens for inline linting, VS Code Icons to visually identify files, REST Client for testing APIs without Postman, npm Intellisense to autocomplete packages from node_modules, dotenv for .env syntax highlighting, TODO Highlight to keep track of tasks, and Project Manager to quickly switch between different projects.

                              <span>Take-Two and EA have quietly slipped AI warnings into their latest 10-K filings, flagging that using generative AI in game development could spark “social and ethical issues,” lead to legal headaches and even erode fan trust. They’re doing it because public companies must list any material risk—from hurricanes to worker strikes—so investors know what could go sideways.
Industry watchers like Niko Partners’ Daniel Ahmad point out that nearly every big studio (yes, even Nintendo) is experimenting with AI, mostly at the concept stage. Take-Two’s boss Strauss Zelnick says these tools will boost efficiency but never replace human creativity, while EA and Microsoft foresee short-term layoffs followed by long-term job growth. Both giants have recently cut hundreds of positions, though it’s unclear how much AI played a role.</span>

The gadget leans on a pocketable compute “puck,” aiming for a price point above the $300 Quest line but well below Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro.
Andrew “Boz” Bosworth reminds everyone that Meta juggles tons of prototypes—some never see daylight—so Loma/Puffin might shift or morph before launch. Still, snagging marquee content could give Meta serious bragging rights in its mixed-reality showdown with Apple.</span>

                              <span>Steve Carell admits he’s genuinely spooked by AI—perfect, flawless art just doesn’t feel real to him, and he worries deepfakes and advanced tech could unleash chaos faster than we think. He’s front-and-center in Jesse Armstrong’s new HBO thriller, Mountainhead, which imagines a world run by tech billionaires where a major deepfake incident throws Asia into violent confusion.
Carell insists Mountainhead is even darker and crazier than Succession, comparing its tone to a modern-day Dr. Strangelove. Yet amid the bone-chilling scenarios, Jesse Armstrong weaves in razor-sharp humor—giving us both a laugh and a terrifying glimpse of a not-so-distant tech-obsessed future.</span>

                              <span>I had a goal: to create a command-line interface (CLI) for a well-known API I was using at work. There wasn’t one available, and I saw an opportunity. The twist? I decided to write it with the help of a Large Language Model (LLM), using Python—a language that isn&#x27;t exactly my mother tongue. The ultimate aim was to release it to the public on PyPI.
This is the story of my journey and the lessons I learned along the way.
My first major hurdle was finding a valid client generator for the OpenAPI spec provided by the API. I went down a rabbit hole trying to find a tool that could generate a set of reusable API client classes that would play nicely with my chosen Python dependency management flavoor.
