                              <span>There was a time when I believed manual work was the hallmark of a diligent engineer. 
I’d SSH into servers one by one, typing the same commands repeatedly:
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install nginx  

At first, it felt productive, like I was &quot;in control.&quot; But over time, the cracks began to show. I was spending hours on tasks that should have been trivial. 
Typos crept in, deployments became inconsistent, and solving the same problems over and over left me exhausted. It wasn’t progress, it was stagnation.  
Manual processes are deceptively risky. 
A misplaced command, a forgotten step, or a server accidentally overlooked could lead to downtime or security gaps. 
I realized I wasn’t just wasting time; 
I was introducing unnecessary human error into systems that demanded precision.

                              <span>A white screen tool is a simple utility that turns your browser into a blank, fullscreen white canvas. It’s surprisingly useful:
📸 Photographers use it for lighting.

🧪 Developers use it to test screens.

💡 Some use it to brighten their room or reduce distractions.



In this quick tutorial, you’ll build your own white screen page using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no libraries or frameworks required.
We’ll start with a minimal structure and a button that will trigger the white screen mode.



  
  White Screen Tool
  
Go Fullscreen White
  



🎨 Step 2: Style the Page with CSS
/* styles.css */
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 2rem;
  background: #f9f9f9;
  color: #333;
}

.button {
  padding: 1rem 2rem;
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  background-color: #0077cc;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 8px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.button:hover {
  background-color: #005fa3;
}

.white-mode {
  background-color: white;
  color: white;
}

🧠 Step 3: Add JavaScript to Go Fullscreen
// script.js
function goWhiteScreen() {
  document.body.classList.add(&quot;white-mode&quot;);

  if (document.documentElement.requestFullscreen) {
    document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
  }
}

                              <span>Today, I had a requirement to render a list of items in two columns.
Interestingly, 2 of the items need to use both columns.
First, I tried to use Flexbox, and then I thought, let&#x27;s use Grid.
To test it out, I created a simple HTML structure for grid layout.
Here it is:

    
1
    
2
    
3
    
4
    
5
    
6
    
7
    
8



In this structure, I created a grid container with 8 items. I needed to span the 7th and 8th items to use both columns. So I have added one more class on it span-both.
And then I added below CSS code to make it work.
.grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* Two columns */
    gap: 10px; /* Space between items */
}

.grid-item {
    background-color: lightblue;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

.span-both {
    grid-column: 1 / -1; /* Span both columns */
}


You might be thinking, &#x27;How does that work?&#x27;
So here is my explanation: 
Grid Container: The display: grid; property activates the grid layout. I used grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); to create two equal columns.
Styling Grid Items: I gave each grid item a light blue background and some padding for better visibility.
Spanning Columns: The .span-both class uses grid-column: 1 / -1;, allowing the 7th and 8th items to stretch across both columns, making them stand out.
That&#x27;s it for today.
Feel free to experiment with different layouts, colors, and spacing to create a grid that suits your needs.
Or let me know if you are having any issues. 
Happy coding!</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m back with another set of 5 DSA problems I tackled today! Today, I’ve focused on explaining both my first approach and final solution. Along with this I have also mentioned what each technique actually enables you to do. Hopefully, this helps anyone who&#x27;s also in the middle of building their intuition. 
Problem:
Link to problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/
Approach:
First Thought:
Tried comparing all strings against each other for anagram checks. I t was too slow.



Final Approach:
Sort each string alphabetically and use it as a key in a hash map.
Group all original strings under the same sorted key.
Topics I learned:
Hash maps allow grouping items based on custom logic (like sorted strings).
Sorting gives a unique &quot;signature&quot; to each anagram group.

What is a Media Query?
A media query is a CSS technique used to apply styles based on the device&#x27;s characteristics, like screen width, height, orientation, or resolution. It helps make websites responsive.
Syntax of a Media Query
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
@media is the rule.
only screen targets screen devices.
(max-width: 600px) means it will apply when the screen is 600px or less.
Inside the curly braces, you write the CSS rules that should apply.
Common Media Query Breakpoints
/* Small devices (phones) */
@media (max-width: 600px) { ... }
/* Tablets */
@media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 992px) { ... }
/* Laptops */
@media (min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px) { ... }
/* Desktops */
@media (min-width: 1201px) { ... }
These are just examples. You can set custom breakpoints based on your design needs.
Why Media Queries Matter
Improves user experience across different devices
Helps build mobile-friendly websites
Allows you to customize layouts for different screen sizes
My Practice Example
/* Default style */
/* For mobile screens */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
This changes the paragraph text size and color on smaller screens.
Final Thoughts
Learning media queries has helped me understand how to build responsive designs. It’s a simple but powerful tool in CSS that every web developer should master.</span>

When I first started my journey as a MERN stack developer, I saw JavaScript and its ecosystem as a whole new world — dynamic, event-driven, and surprisingly flexible. However, having a solid background in Core Java gave me a foundation that turned out to be incredibly valuable, even if the syntax and paradigms seemed worlds apart at first.
In this blog, I’ll share my personal experience of how mastering Core Java concepts like multithreading, memory management, and object-oriented principles helped me become a better MERN developer. I’ll dive into how these Java fundamentals sharpened my understanding of backend architecture, asynchronous programming in Node.js, and even front-end design thinking.

You&#x27;ve got tons of cool stuff, but customers are wandering around aimlessly, hoping to stumble upon something they like. Without a decent recommendation system, that&#x27;s basically what they&#x27;re doing. They might use the search bar, but unless they know exactly what they want, they&#x27;re probably missing out on hidden gems.
&quot;Customers who buy socks also buy shoes&quot;, is that really helpful?
Another approach is doing a manual categorisation. You&#x27;d spend ages tagging products with categories, hoping that a customer browsing &quot;hiking boots&quot; will somehow see those awesome arch-support socks.
You can count on bestsellers, but just because something is popular doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s right for that specific customer.

  Don’t


The best strategy for distributed caching is often not to use it!
It’s challenging to implement and adds complexity to your system. As we all know, complexity is the root of most problems in software development.
So, avoid it if possible.
Before considering distributed caching, focus on optimizing your application, database, connection, network, or even hardware. Use in-memory caching instead.
At some point, you’ll need to consider caching to improve performance. Start by leveraging the internal in-memory caching mechanisms provided by your back-end framework, database caching, etc.
Believe it or not, most tools have built-in caching providers you can utilize.
In many cases, these simple optimizations can significantly improve your appli…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price consolidates as resistance at $105,000 prevents a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are slightly bearish, but historical data suggests a sudden bullish move should not be ruled out.


Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range over the past seven days as the $105,000 level remains the overhead resistance to break.

Bitcoin unable to crack $105,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC’s price has been oscillating between its resistance level at $105,000 and $101,500, where it has found support.
“$BTC is stuck in a narrowing $101.5K–$104K range,” said Swissblock in a May 16 post on X.

“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages.

XRP is retesting a falling wedge breakout, which could lead to a rally toward $3.60.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.
Will XRP’s price sustain the recovery or drop further in the coming days? Let’s examine.

New Bitcoin price targets leverage interplay with gold to deliver $200,000 and higher this year.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model.

Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end.

 
Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.

Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt (USDT) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network, offering enhanced privacy, autonomy and resilience. 
Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. 
A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin (BTC) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Developm…</span>

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

There hasn&#x27;t been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.
Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. 
The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.
Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.

“This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added.
The firm stated that it had conducted a thorough investigation and is implementing measures to enhance the AI chatbot’s transparency and reliability.

“Historic day! Our shareholders have approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed in Brazil,” Israel Salmen posted to X on May 15.
Salmen said the firm snapped up 274.52 Bitcoin (BTC) for an average purchase price of $103,604, achieving a BTC yield of 600%. 
Méliuz now holds 320.3 Bitcoin, worth a little over $33 million, with the latest purchase adding to the Brazilian fintech firm’s first purchase of 45.73 Bitcoin on March 6.

“If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said.  
If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said.

“After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General,” Clayton wrote.

                              <span>The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB), which oversees the state’s retirement funds, unloaded its shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) during the first quarter, filings show.
The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, liquidating all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. 
The more than 6 million IBIT shares are worth around $355.6 million at current prices.
SWIB was one of the first state investment funds to provide Bitcoin exposure to US retirees when it bought $164 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 — the same quarter the Bitcoin products launched.

                              <span>Global foreign exchange and payments platforms are lobbying hard against stablecoins, which stand to significantly disrupt their business models, investor Kevin O’Leary said during a keynote address at Consensus 2025. 
Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been “hiccups” in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. 
Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

The remarks came during a panel at Consensus 2025. Sharing the stage with Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8, Trump said Bitcoin adoption has been incredible.
“I&#x27;m traveling. I&#x27;m on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.”

                              <span>Key takeaway:

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

&quot;I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily,&quot; Nazarov said on May 14.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

                              <span>More than two-and-a-half years after filing for bankruptcy, cryptocurrency exchange FTX is moving forward with repaying users who have not had access to their funds.
In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Pampati said that “the whole world outside of the United States […] has already jumped onto this [stablecoins],” adding that “the US is [...] at the doorstep.” 
“I really think about new use cases that can emerge because of the borderless nature of stablecoins, because of the efficiency of the dollar onchain,” he said. “If you&#x27;re trying to send money to your friend in Nigeria, why do you have to go through a bunch of hoops?”

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

Bitcoin&#x27;s 36% rebound from $74,500 runs into resistance at $106,000.

Bid-side liquidity is staking up on the downside near $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 36% from its April 9, five-month low at $74,500. However, its failure to decisively break above $106,000 has sparked concerns about whether a sharp correction is possible in the coming days.

                              <span>The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

                              <span>Coinbase has reportedly fired a group of customer support agents following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. The contracted agents were based in India. 
According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase&#x27;s chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. 
The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.
