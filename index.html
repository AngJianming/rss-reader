Terraform is frequently chosen for managing infrastructure on Azure. In many cases, it is adopted without a thorough risk assessment.

This article is intended for decision-makers, risk owners, and stakeholders responsible for operational and technological stability. It outlines the critical risks associated with using Terraform for Azure — not to provoke fear or criticism, but to enable informed governance and responsible infrastructure decisions.

                              <span>React useReducer hook is a powerful alternative to the useState hook for managing complex states efficiently. If your state logic involves multiple conditions or dependencies, useReducer provides a structured way to handle it.
In this post, you’ll learn about the useReducer hook, including its syntax, how it works, and the difference between useState and useReducer.

useReducer is a React Hook that helps manage state using a functional approach.
Instead of directly updating the state (like useState), it uses a reducer function that receives an action and decides how to update the state. It follows a dispatch-action pattern, similar to Redux.

When developing applications locally, testing webhooks, or showcasing your project to someone remotely, exposing your local server to the internet becomes essential. While there are several tools to achieve this, including localtunnel, serveo, and pagekite. Today we will focus on one of the most popular and reliable options — ngrok.
ngrok creates secure tunnels from the public internet to your localhost, enabling developers to share and test applications without deploying them.
Using ngrok comes with several advantages:
Testing Webhooks: Tools like Stripe, GitHub, and Twilio require public URLs to send data. ngrok lets you test them locally.
Remote Demos: You can share your local project with clients or teammates instantly, no need to deploy.
Cross-device Testing: Easily tes…</span>

If you&#x27;ve ever encountered a segmentation fault (segfault) while working with the fmt library in C++, you know how frustrating it can be. You&#x27;re compiling your code using Release or RelWithDebInfo, and suddenly, you find yourself staring at a mysterious bug. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore potential reasons for such behavior, especially focusing on the unexpected initialization of a std::string variable in the context of the fmt library.
Understanding Segfaults in C++
A segmentation fault is an error that occurs when a program tries to access a memory location that it&#x27;s not allowed to. This can happen for various reasons:
Dereferencing a null or uninitialized pointer
Accessing an out-of-bounds array index
Mismanaging memory allocations and deallocations
In C++, segfaults can of…</span>

                              <span>Hey DEV Community!
I recently wrote a beginner-friendly blog that breaks down one of the most important (yet often overlooked) steps in Machine Learning: Data Preprocessing.
We often jump straight into model building, but did you know that 80% of a successful ML project depends on how well the data is preprocessed? Only 20% depends on the algorithm you choose. So if your data isn’t clean, integrated, and well-prepared, even the best algorithm won’t help.
In this blog, I explain:
What is Data Preprocessing?
Why is it important in ML?
Five essential techniques with real-life examples:
Data Cleaning: Removing noise, handling missing values
Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources (like triangulation and crowdsourcing)
Data Transformation: Scaling, normalization, generalization, aggregation
Data Reduction: Making big data more manageable (using techniques like dimensional reduction, numeric encoding)
Data Discretization: Converting continuous data into categories or groups
I’ve included analogies like organizing a kitchen or planning a birthday party to help explain complex ideas in a simple and relatable way.
Read the full blog here:
Whether you&#x27;re a beginner or refreshing your fundamentals, I’d love for you to give it a read and share your feedback!
Thanks for reading!

                              <span>A hacker involved in the $4.67 million exploit of the decentralized finance lending protocol Voltage Finance in 2022 has moved some of the stolen Ether to Tornado Cash after a short hibernation. 
Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

                              <span>Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream.
Source: Hash
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

                              <span>US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.   
The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. 
If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description.

Shortly after Trump announced the memecoin launch on social media, the price surged from roughly $2.00 to $12.95 — a 550% increase. The traders reportedly sold their holdings within 12 hours.
“In total, the 24 accounts bought up 16.7mn of the 200mn total $MELANIA tokens scheduled for sale during the launch period,” the Financial Times reported. “[...] the run of sales that started pre-launch continued. About $900,000 worth of tokens bought by an additional 22…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your co…</span>

                              <span>For months, Cointelegraph took part in an investigation centered around a suspected North Korean operative that uncovered a cluster of threat actors attempting to score freelancing gigs in the cryptocurrency industry.
The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…</span>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum&#x27;s rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum&#x27;s real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …</span>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.
