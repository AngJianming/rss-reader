                              <span>Key Takeaways: 

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC).
The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities — a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. 
Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war che…</span>

Bitcoin price hangs near $97,000 as traders await today’s FOMC minutes.

Bitcoin holding $95,000 as support is key for bullish price expansion in the short term.

Select altcoins are holding their respective support levels, opening the gates for a short-term rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to knock down the immediate resistance at $97,895 and challenge the all-important $100,000 level. Crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin are positive about further gains as they have acquired 81,338 Bitcoin over the past six weeks.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What&#x27;s holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech&#x27;s fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook&#x27;s dominance?

                              <span>Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

Still, BTC miner Hive Digital Technologies is doubling down on the untapped potential of the Latin American (LATAM) market.
In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Hive Digital Technologies’ president and CEO, Aydin Kilic, said that Paraguay presents a compelling long-term opportunity equipped with “geopolitical stability, low-cost hydro energy, and a government open to foreign investment”.

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …</span>

The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

                              <span>Japan’s Metaplanet purchased an additional 555 Bitcoin as part of its aggressive accumulation strategy, bringing its total holdings to 5,555 BTC, valued at over $536 million at current prices.
On May 7, the Tokyo-listed firm disclosed that it spent $53.4 million acquiring 555 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $96,134. The company now holds 5,555 BTC, purchased for $481.5 million at an average price of $86,672 per Bitcoin, according to CEO Simon Gerovich.
The company also announced the issuance of another $25 million in zero-coupon ordinary bonds to fund its ongoing BTC buys. Since early 2024, the firm has raised over 35 billion yen ($244 million) through zero-coupon bonds and stock acquisition rights via its partner, Evo Fund.

                              <span>Movement Labs confirmed the termination of its co-founder, Rushi Manche, following controversy over a market maker deal that he brokered.
Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

                              <span>A hacker involved in the $4.67 million exploit of the decentralized finance lending protocol Voltage Finance in 2022 has moved some of the stolen Ether to Tornado Cash after a short hibernation. 
Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added. 
“IBIT alone has done this in a few weeks, more than a year after launch.”

APIs have become the lifeblood of modern digital ecosystems. Ensuring scalability, fairness, and resilience is no longer optional—it’s fundamental. Traditional rate limiting techniques offer a static shield against abuse and overload, but they can fall short when faced with dynamic, ever-shifting workloads. Inspired by the adaptive system design strategies from Alex Xu’s acclaimed System Design Interview series, this article explores a powerful, nuanced alternative: building adaptive rate limiters using AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). We delve into how AIMD works, why Redis is an ideal backend, and provide a full C# implementation to empower developers building the next generation of cloud-native APIs.

                              <span>Introduction
In this article, we tackle an interesting problem in Java programming regarding the management and display of duplicate values in an array. We are working with a Java program that identifies duplicate entries in a list and organizes their respective information. The goal is to improve the output format of our program, specifically how we display duplicates alongside their parents. Understanding this will not only enhance the readability of your console output but will also aid significantly in debugging issues and analyzing data patterns.
Understanding the Problem
The provided code iterates through a list of file contents, identifies duplicate entries, and tries to format them for display. However, the output currently only shows the original values, not the associated duplica…</span>

If you&#x27;ve used LangChain, you already know the idea of &quot;chaining logical steps&quot; in LLM workflows. SynTeam Framework brings a structural alternative: a lightweight, JSON-based templating system that defines Units (roles), Tasks (execution order), and Operators (data routing) – all optimized for prompt-native environments like ChatGPT.
Unlike LangChain’s Python-centric abstraction, SynTeam templates run entirely within the LLM context, allowing you to:
Design execution flows without writing code
Assign responsibility explicitly to each processing block
Keep your logic transparent and reproducible inside the LLM session itself
This post is for developers, LLM engineers, and technical architects who want structure and predictability without external libraries.

I&#x27;ve always been curious about how most of the technologies I use on a day-to-day basis work. One of the things we as programmers have to interact with daily is HTTP servers. Most of the time, we don&#x27;t think much about it since HTTP has been around for a long time, and there are thousands of HTTP servers and clients, so most people don&#x27;t give much thought to how these technologies work!
As someone who worked on many web-based applications and built many restful APIs, I would like to think that I have a pretty good understanding of how the HTTP protocol works and how HTTP servers generally function, however, since I&#x27;ve always been using ready-made HTTP servers (Mostly Kesterl, IIS and Nginx) and HTTP clients (curl, postman, httpie) I felt that there&#x27;s a lot that I can learn …</span>

Many developers create S3 buckets using the default console settings, CLI scripts, or even automation templates (like CloudFormation or Terraform) — without fully reviewing access policies.
🎯 What could go wrong?
public-read or public-write is enabled by mistake
Bucket policies allow Principal: &quot;*&quot;

Static websites are deployed with no access restrictions
Files contain sensitive data: .env, backup.zip, user-data.csv




Case Study

A dev team created a bucket to share app logs for debugging. The bucket had public access, and after 3 weeks it was indexed by a search engine. It contained logs with API keys and customer email addresses.

💸 This resulted in an internal audit and months of cleanup work.

                              <span>Problem 1: Check for a Toeplitz Matrix



  
  
  Problem:


You are given an n x n square matrix. Write a function is_toeplitz(matrix) that checks whether the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix.
A Toeplitz matrix is one where every descending diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (↘️) contains the same elements.
Consider this matrix:
6 7 8
4 6 7
1 4 6

The diagonals are:
[1],
[4, 4],
[6, 6, 6],
[7, 7],
[8]
All elements in each diagonal are equal — so this is a Toeplitz matrix ✅.
To check if a matrix is Toeplitz:
Loop through each element in the matrix (excluding the last row and column).
For each element, compare it with the one diagonally down-right from it.
If any of those pairs don’t match, return False.
If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.
from typing import List

def is_toeplitz(matrix: List[List[int]]) -&gt; bool:
    n &#x3D; len(matrix)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i + 1 &lt; n and j + 1 &lt; n:
                if matrix[i][j] !&#x3D; matrix[i + 1][j + 1]:
                    return False

    return True

matrix &#x3D; [

                              <span>TL;DR: Famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu just launched Mechanize, a startup that vows to “fully automate all work” (at least white-collar jobs) by building data, evaluation tools and digital environments so AI agents can replace human labor. He even crunched the numbers: a potential $60 trillion-a-year market globally.  
The announcement sparked a firestorm—critics say it tarnishes the reputation of his non-profit lab Epoch (already dinged for cozy ties to OpenAI), and worry mass automation benefits companies at the expense of workers. Mechanize boasts heavyweight backers like Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross and Jeff Dean, but the debate rages on: is this the dawn of explosive economic growth or a fast track to a human‐work apocalypse?</span>

                              <span>In this article, we’ll dive into an essential customization feature in Filament: Render Hooks. These hooks allow you to insert or modify HTML content in specific parts of your Filament pages without overriding or duplicating existing views. We&#x27;ll demonstrate this with a practical example: adding a &quot;Back to Website&quot; link above the login and register forms in the admin panel.
A Render Hook in Filament is a predefined insertion point in the views where you can add HTML or Blade content using the FilamentView::registerRenderHook method.
Advantages of Render Hooks:
No need to publish or modify Filament&#x27;s views.
Reduces potential conflicts during Filament updates.
Flexibility to inject content at strategic locations.

                              <span>You&#x27;ve probably heard it a thousand times:
&quot;Just ship a crappy MVP and see what happens.&quot;
It&#x27;s a mantra in startup culture. Move fast. Break things. Launch half-baked ideas and hope someone bites.
But here&#x27;s what actually happens most of the time:
The problem isn&#x27;t that your idea sucks.

MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product, a term popularized by Eric Ries in The Lean Startup. It was meant to encourage founders to avoid wasting months or years building features nobody wanted.
But over time, people twisted the idea.
Now &quot;MVP&quot; gets tossed around as a free pass to cut every corner:
Sloppy UX
No feedback loop
Buggy core flows
All under the excuse of &quot;we&#x27;ll improve it later.&quot;
But minimum doesn&#x27;t mean careless, and viable means it has to work.
A good MVP is small in scope, but sharp in executio…</span>
