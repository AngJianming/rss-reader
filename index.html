My husband and I have a 4-year old Cockapoo who is quite reactive to say the least! We are both coders and have been talking about building an app to solve some of our own problems but have never built a mobile app before (only webapps). When we came across the World’s Largest Hackathon we realized this could be the perfect opportunity to give expo a shot in bolt.new!
I&#x27;ll be documenting our prompts and progress here if you&#x27;d like to follow along!
Ana &amp; Chris
We decided to spend some time working on our first prompt so the app had a solid foundation to start with. We tried to design the structure around the type of simple yet helpful app we&#x27;d want to use! We also thought out what databases tables we wanted to start with (we love using supabase in nextjs apps so a postgres…</span>

While developers can certainly build AI agents from the ground up using programming languages like Python or JavaScript, this approach can be time-consuming and hard to scale. That’s where AI agent frameworks come in to streamline this development process! 
Curious about what AI agent frameworks actually are? How to choose the right one? And what are the most popular AI agent frameworks​ out there? Let’s dive in below!
AI agent frameworks are platforms, libraries, or development environments that simplify the creation of automated agents.

                              <span>Hey problem solvers! 🎯
Today we’re tackling a fun and elegant problem from LeetCode — 3423: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array. This one checks your understanding of array boundaries and circular behavior. Let’s break it down. 🔍
You&#x27;re given a circular array nums, and your task is to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, where:
The first and last elements are also considered adjacent (because it&#x27;s circular).
You return the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers.
Input: nums &#x3D; [1, 2, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
|1 - 2| &#x3D; 1, |2 - 4| &#x3D; 2, |4 - 1| &#x3D; 3.
3.
The array is circular, so both regular adjacent pairs and the pair between the last and first element must be considered.
Initialize ans with |nums[0] - nums[n-1]|.
Iterate through the array and compute |nums[i] - nums[i+1]| for all valid i.
Return the maximum of all these values.
class Solution {
 public:
  int maxAdjacentDistance(vector&amp; nums) {
    int ans &#x3D; abs(nums.front() - nums.back());

    for (int i &#x3D; 0; i + 1 &lt; nums.size(); ++i)
      ans &#x3D; max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));

    return ans;
  }
};

var maxAdjacentDistance &#x3D; function(nums) {
    let ans &#x3D; Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[nums.length - 1]);

    for (let i &#x3D; 0; i + 1 &lt; nums.length; ++i) {
        ans &#x3D; Math.max(ans, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));
    }

    return ans;
};

def maxAdjacentDistance(nums):
    ans &#x3D; abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])

    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        ans &#x3D; max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))

    return ans

Input: nums &#x3D; [1, 2, 4]
Output: 3

Input: nums &#x3D; [-5, -10, -5]
Output: 5

Input: nums &#x3D; [0, 100, -100]
Output: 200

Time Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array
Space Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space

This is a great warm-up problem to train your attention to edge conditions like circular connections. Simple logic and clean implementation go a long way here.

    Reliable in multiple languages
    Able to handle layouts and OCR

Today, I will tell you about a mobile game that actually experienced factory-style hacking from China and how it was blocked and the game ecosystem was protected through LIAPP.

The ranking reliability suddenly collapsed one day
This case is the story of Company A&#x27;s mobile game that had secured a global user base.
In particular, since the competition was strong and the user ranking structure affected the game content and rewards, maintaining the fairness of the ranking was the key to game operation.
However, at some point, a strange phenomenon began to occur.
Accounts that were not normally seen rose to the top of the rankings in one day,

                              <span>The world of data has long been divided into two primary camps: the data lake and the data warehouse. Each has offered distinct advantages, with data lakes excelling in storing vast quantities of raw, diverse data at low cost, and data warehouses providing structured, high-performance environments for business intelligence (BI) and reporting. However, as organizations increasingly sought to leverage both traditional BI and advanced analytics, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), the limitations of this bifurcated approach became glaring. Data duplication, complex ETL pipelines, governance headaches, and the struggle to maintain a single source of truth often led to inefficiencies and delayed insights. The emergence of the data lakehouse paradigm directly addres…</span>

                              <span>Problem Description &amp; Analysis:


The Teradata database table has three fields: date, account, and the name of the product purchased by the account.

Task: Now we need to calculate how many types of products each account has purchased before each day, that is, the number of different products purchased from the beginning to the previous day.

Group by ACCOUNT, then by date, process each group in turn, get the interval from first group from to the current group, and perform deduplication and counting.
But SQL grouping must be accompanied by aggregation, and cannot retain grouped subsets for further processing; At this point, it is necessary to change the mindset, set various markers to transition, and write multi-layer nested statements to repeatedly traverse the data table in order to calculate.
SPL allows grouping to retain grouped subsets for further processing. SPL’s cross row references are also much simpler than window functions:

A1: Load data through JDBC.
A2: Group by account.
A3: Process each group of A2: Continue grouping by date, process daily data, get data of groups from the beginning to the previous day, union these groups, and calculate the quantity of different product names. Finally, union the processing results of each upper-level group. [: -1] represents the set from the first member to the previous member, and the function icount is used for unique count, i.e. count (distinct)
A4: Change the 0 in column 3 to null.

                              <span>Why Multi-Tenancy Matters for Vector Databases


When I started building AI products with real-world customer isolation requirements, the limitations of existing vector search infrastructure quickly became obvious. For anyone who’s wrestled with the question of whether to split each customer into their own database instance or try to multiplex everyone into a single shared set of tables, the trade-offs become stark as usage grows. Logical isolation, operational simplicity, and real query performance all pull in different directions.
In the vector space, the equivalent of a relational table is the collection—each with its own schema, index, and access boundaries. With SaaS-style applications, especially those with privacy or model customization demands, a collection-per-tenant approach has …</span>
