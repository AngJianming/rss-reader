                              <span>Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a new all-time high on May 21 on easing macroeconomic fears and continued inflows into the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Analysts expect the momentum to continue and Bitcoin to surge to $200,000 by the end of the year.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…</span>

In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after President Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024. The model, which uses quantile regression to map Bitcoin’s price phases on a logarithmic scale, indicates the cryptocurrency is in the Transit…</span>

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether&#x27;s recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView. This climb to a record high came nine days after the White House announced a 90-day trade agreement between the US and China on May 12, temporarily slashing import tariffs to 10%.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It&#x27;s a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. 
Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said. 
SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph that the “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user” so that there are no technical barriers.

In a May 21 post on X, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong said the bill had passed its third reading, clearing the final hurdle for adoption.
“It is expected that by the end of this year, major institutions will be able to apply to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers,” Ng said.

Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.

Near-term upside targets include a “blow-off top” at $128,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) spiked to more than $108,000 on May 21, marking new four-month highs. Where will BTC/USD go next?
Crypto traders and analysts are lining up their forecasts with BTC price action less than 1.5% away from new all-time highs.

Bitcoin continues to coil below what is now its most significant psychological resistance barrier, January’s all-time highs.

                              <span>United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce said many non-fungible tokens (NFTs), including those with mechanisms to pay creator royalties, likely fall outside the purview of federal securities laws.
In a recent speech, Peirce said NFTs that allow artists to earn resale revenue do not automatically qualify as securities. Unlike stocks, NFTs are programmable assets that distribute proceeds to developers or artists. The SEC official said that mirrors how streaming platforms compensate musicians and filmmakers. 
“Just as streaming platforms pay royalties to the creator of a song or video each time a user plays it, an NFT can enable artists to benefit from the appreciation in the value of their work after its initial sale,” Peirce said. 
Peirce added that …</span>

On May 20, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) of South Korea said during its fourth Virtual Asset Committee meeting that it had finalized sweeping new measures.
Set to take effect in June, the updated rules allow both nonprofit organizations and virtual asset exchanges to sell cryptocurrencies, but under new compliance standards.
Nonprofit entities must have at least five years of audited financial history to be permitted to receive and sell virtual asset donations. They will also need to establish internal Donation Review Committees to assess the appro…</span>

Crypto transfers fail more often than most people realize, but user attentiveness can stop most losses.
What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user.
But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take contro…</span>

Smets said the strategy focuses on specialist managers who can outperform generalist investors in the earliest funding rounds.

The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.

While many of us have some or the other way have come across the UI performance issues in react which on digging take us to same old simplifying heavy DOM. It can be rendering large list items in list, lazy loading, image optimization, etc.
With time as the application scales up the simplifying DOM rendering becomes a complex process. Here we are looking into list rendering but in virtual manner. typically we developers use map function to render the list in rows. with this approach rendering thousands of rows browser will create same no. of DOM elements. The DOM in background is using CPU/GPU of users system. This is not it, the CPU consumption increase with user events such as scroll or performing CRUD operations which results reduced framerate, lag …</span>

                              <span>It started from the idea that it would be cool to have an automatically generated &quot;zen koan&quot; play out at a specified interval, automatically generated using prompt-engineering to created varied outputs. For example, every hour between 8AM and 8PM, I would call the API with a prompt like &quot;Inspire me with amazing life energy and tie in _____&quot; and the blank would be filled in with a random word or phrase so that each generation was fresh. Then this would be turned into audio with TTS and played through the speakers. This was just the basic idea, and I quickly began building this using Python scripting and ample help from GPT to accelerate the process.
Quickly I realized it would be more fun to make it a creative app, and ideas began to flow. Eventually it became more to my taste as an artisti…</span>

                              <span>As a front-end dev still sharpening my skills, JavaScript keeps surprising me. Here are 5 simple but powerful JS tricks I wish I had discovered earlier — and now use all the time:
1. Optional Chaining (?.)
const userName &#x3D; user?.profile?.name ?? &quot;Guest&quot;;

2. Destructuring for Cleaner Code
const { name, age } &#x3D; person;
const [first, second] &#x3D; colors;


3. Array.some() and Array.every()
items.some(item &#x3D;&gt; item.stock &gt; 0);  
items.every(item &#x3D;&gt; item.stock &gt; 0);


4. Spread &amp; Rest Operators
const newArray &#x3D; [...arr1, ...arr2];  
function sum(...nums) { return nums.reduce((a, b) &#x3D;&gt; a + b, 0); }


5. Short-Circuit Evaluation
&amp;&amp; and || to simplify conditional logic:
isLoggedIn &amp;&amp; showDashboard();  
const user &#x3D; input || &quot;Anonymous&quot;;


These tricks aren&#x27;t advanced — just practical. Once I started using them, my code became much cleaner and easier to understand. If you&#x27;re learning JavaScript, give these a try!

Allez dans Boot Manager.


Sélectionnez le CD contenant l’image iso pour l’installation de Archlinux. Ici on a : UEFI QEMU DVD-ROM QM00001.

                              <span>Introduction


YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language designed for configuration and data interchange. Unlike XML or JSON, YAML uses minimal syntax and indentation (spaces) to represent structure, making it easy for humans to read and write.
Developers encounter YAML all the time: it’s the backbone of many DevOps tools (Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose files, Ansible playbooks, CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions workflows, etc.). 
For instance, GitHub Actions workflows are defined in YAML files (in .github/workflows/), since “YAML is a markup language that’s commonly used for configuration files”. Because of its ubiquity in modern tooling and its focus on readability, understanding YAML is invaluable for developers.

that stuck with me way more than i expected. i kept thinking: if i died today, would anyone know how to get into my stuff and recover all crypto that i stacked on different platforms? probably not. and that’s not because i have millions (i wish), but because our lives are so deeply tied to digital accounts now. everything from money to memories is behind a login screen.
and yet - no one talks about what happens to it all when we&#x27;re gone.

If you&#x27;re just starting out or want a simpler way, the MaIN.NET library offers a minimal setup to get you connected with just a few lines of code.
This tutorial shows how to configure your app to use Gemini and includes a small example project to demonstrate interaction with the model.

In our previous post on Prompt Engineering, we explored how to give clear instructions to our creative AI felines. 😹
Now, let&#x27;s dive deeper and peek inside the &quot;engine room&quot;. What exactly is Generative AI? How does it power these amazing capabilities? What makes these models tick?
Generative AI is essentially a system combining countless learned patterns to create something entirely new.
To help visualize the fundamental concept of how it works, I’ve put together another visual story. This time, it involves a rather surprising (and overflowing) box of tiny cats!




As our cat-filled box illustrates, you can think of Generative AI as that brand new, super-talented cat that emerges. It can meow happily, purr with contentment, and knows all the best…</span>

However, all the common solutions I’ve found is just the MediaProjection API—have major limitations. For instance, it requires user approval every time the device reboots, and apps like YouTube can interrupt the recording process when they enter full-screen mode.
Despite this, I’ve seen some parental control apps like Ever Accountable that request permission only once(Not Screen Recording-Installed Apps, but Accessibility, Device Administrator, Usage Stats and Notifications), can take screenshots silently in the background, and are not affected by interruptions from other apps.
Can someone please recommend a proper, persistent solution for taking background screenshots without requiring repeated user interaction or being interrupted by other apps?</span>

In modern React development, managing state predictably is key to building maintainable, scalable applications. While useState handles simple state needs, useReducer shines when your component’s state logic becomes more complex or when the next state depends on the previous one.
In this article, we&#x27;ll break down the useReducer hook in depth and show how it enables clear, scalable, and testable state transitions. We’ll also build a mathematical counter using reducer patterns, covering advanced JavaScript concepts like the spread operator, custom actions, and strict typing with TypeScript.
useReducer?


useReducer is a React hook that provides an alternative to useState. It’s commonly used when:

&#x60;[settings.profiles.release]
[settings.profiles.debug]
[settings.profiles.your_profile]
You can add custom profiles with your own names and flags, making builds fully tailored to your needs.
Additional improvements include better internal architecture and updated documentation to help you use these new features.
Getting started: Update to Zyn 2.1.0, configure your profiles in zyn.toml, and build with:
