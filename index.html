                              <span>As robots become more deeply integrated into logistics, healthcare, research, and everyday life, they also become more attractive targets for cyber threats. Network security in robotics is no longer optional—especially when those systems rely on distributed middleware like ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).
In this article, part of our broader ROS 2 robot hardening series, we focus on using Suricata, a high-performance open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), to monitor and alert on suspicious network traffic in real time.
🔎 This guide covers installing Suricata on an Ubuntu 24.04-based ROS 2 robot, integrating it into an automated main.sh install script, and validating the setup.

                              <span>Hey Dev.to community! As a software engineer, I’ve spent way too many hours lost in sprawling codebases, tracing dependencies, or writing technical documents that are stale by next sprint. It’s exhausting, right? Tools like Copilot speed up coding the boilerplate stuff, but they don’t help me understand complex projects or keep docs current. I’m exploring two ideas to tackle this, inspired by an open-source project I’m tinkering with, and I’d love to hear your thoughts!
Picture this: You join a new team, open a repo, and it’s a maze of folders with no clear guide. Or you’re updating a project, but the README hasn’t been touched in months. At my day job, I spend over half my time just reading code to figure out what’s going on. Writing and maintaining docs is another time-sink—boring, tedious, and always falling behind. Anyone else stuck in this loop?
I’m brainstorming ways to simplify this mess with AI-powered tools. Here are two concepts I’m excited about:
What if an AI could scan your code and create a README.md for every folder in your repo? It’d summarize what each folder does—say, explaining the /utils folder’s helper functions—and update automatically when you change the code. No more manual doc-writing or begging colleagues for context. I’m imagining an open-source tool that makes docs granular and current, even for chaotic repos. (Those existing good products are not open source.)
The RAG has been really trendy for the past few years, but generic models often miss the mark. 
These are early ideas, and I want to swap stories and brainstorm with you all:
What&#x27;s the worst codebase headache you&#x27;ve faced?
Would auto-generated READMEs or smarter code search make your day easier?
Got any must-have features or tools you love for this stuff?
I’m playing with these concepts in an open-source project, so if you’re into collaborating or just want to poke around, check it out here. Let’s make codebases less painful together!
Happy coding,
Gaby</span>

Creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) client in C# using Azure Open AI&#x27;s SDK can be a rewarding endeavor, particularly when it comes to implementing advanced features like Sampling. Users often encounter challenges when trying to access the required IChatClient instance for the Sampling handler implementation. In this article, we&#x27;ll walk you through how to properly configure the Azure Open AI SDK, build a chat completion, and extract the IChatClient instance necessary for creating a Sampling handler for your MCP client.
Understanding the MCP Client Structure
Before diving into the code, it&#x27;s essential to understand the structure of the MCP client and why the IChatClient instance is critical. The MCP client is designed to facilitate rich, interactive chat experiences over Azu…</span>

When we refreshed the Measured visual identity, a website rebuild was always part of that scope.
We expected to make some careful typographic refinements in that process. But what followed was an unexpected deep dive into how fonts are distributed and integrated into modern web infrastructure.
This is an account of what we encountered, the choices we made, and some thoughts that may be relevant to teams using fonts — and those making and distributing them. We’ve gone quite heavy with hyperlinks by way of explaining terms if needed.
Note: Though true when we were rebuilding the site around December 2024, some of the detail of what follows has since changed. I’ve done my best to call this out when that’s the case. Hopefully the broader t…</span>

                              <span>The cloud used to be messy, and then it got boring.
In the early days, the hosting market was fragmented: colocation, on-prem, little server resellers everywhere.
Then came the hyperscalers. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure. They brought economies of scale, virtualization, and global infrastructure that changed everything. It was a consolidation wave that ate the market.
And almost all of them? American.
For a long time, nobody [1] really cared. If you had your data in a Frankfurt data center, and your vendor had the right certificates, you were good. Enterprises signed their DPA agreements and moved on. The hyperscalers dominated.
But that era is coming to an end, and not for purely technical reasons.

AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure hold 67% of the market. Source: Synergy Research Group.

Instead of developing in-house DevOps capabilities, teams gain access to pre-built infrastructure and expert support. Service providers deliver a variety of solutions tailored to different organizational needs, such as CI/CD pipelines and configuration management as managed services.
Traditional DevOps emphasizes close collaboration between development and operations teams across the software lifecycle. It promotes a culture where operational considerations are treated as equally important as software architecture, design, and coding.

                              <span>We’ve built an internal AI-powered tool to automate .NET app migrations. Here’s how it works:
A static code analysis engine parses .NET codebases to detect deprecated features. It flags compatibility gaps with modern .NET versions. It also identifies Windows-only dependencies that block cross-platform adoption. The tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand code context, for example, to tell apart, say, DataSet used in UI from heavy SQL workflows in business logic.


The AI transformation engine recognizes patterns based on real migration projects. It suggests refactors like replacing HttpModule with middleware. Developers then review and refine AI suggestions in VS Code or Visual Studio. This is important for handling edge cases like COM interop.


After transformation, the tool validates the migrated code by generating automated test cases. It compares pre- and post-migration test results to catch regressions and ensure nothing breaks.



Our internal tests show ~50% of code can be migrated automatically, cutting manual effort.

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.
Finally, EIP-7691 increases the number of data blobs per block, which allows for better layer-2 scalability and potentially signif…</span>

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …</span>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

                              <span>A hacker involved in the $4.67 million exploit of the decentralized finance lending protocol Voltage Finance in 2022 has moved some of the stolen Ether to Tornado Cash after a short hibernation. 
Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital.

On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

Democrats aim at Trump’s crypto profits with a 3-prong pincer move
US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.   
The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>

The ETP is listed on Euronext’s Paris and Amsterdam exchanges, 21Shares said in a May 6 announcement. 
Cronos (CRO) is a layer-1 blockchain network affiliated with Crypto.com, a centralized exchange. 
The chain is designed to integrate with the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems and support “decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications,” 21Shares said. 
The ETP aims to provide investors with a “straightforward way to integrate CRO into their portfolios through traditional banks and brokers, eliminating the need to directly handle digital wallets or exchanges,” 21Shares said.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

Solana’s stablecoin supply rose by 156% in 2025, to hit a new record at $12 billion.

Solana’s TVL grew by 25% to $7.65 billion, with 27.7% decentralized exchange volume share, leading Ethereum and BNB Chain.

SOL price formed a bull flag, with a price target at $220.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL) failed to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching $156 on April 25, but an assortment of data points suggests that the altcoin’s upside is not over.
