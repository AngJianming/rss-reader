                              <span>Last week was a turning point for me. I had the chance to speak at two conferences (FinOpsX 2025 and HAProxyConf 2025) in the same week, and I finally met someone I’ve admired for years. These experiences opened my eyes to how much we can learn when stepping outside the usual environment and talking to people from different backgrounds, industries, and stages of their careers. 

At both events, I found myself surrounded by people with different stories and perspectives. Some were just starting out, others were industry veterans, and everyone had something unique to share. Listening to their experiences made me realize how valuable it is to look beyond and see what’s happening in the wider world. It’s easy to get caught up in daily work, but when we zoom out, we can find new ideas and inspi…</span>

So I came across the Frontend Challenge: June Celebrations (CSS Art) on dev.to, and I thought: &quot;Hey, what if I build a handy dandy crate for our gay friends that they can slap onto their rusty websites?&quot; This way, I learn a bit more about CSS, make something useful, and give Ferris the crab 🦀 a chance to finally come out of the shell.
And so, Pride RS was born.
Pride RS is a drop-in, customizable rusty component for rendering LGBTQ+ pride flags directly in your Rust frontend. From celebrating Pride Month, to adding some rainbow love to your app, or just want a vertical NonBinary flag for reasons between you and your browser, Pride RS makes it extremely easy.
Flags are rendered using flex-direction, composed of CSS-powered color stripes that flex in all the right directions: ho…</span>

                              <span>Hey dev.to 👋
Ravan, a 17-year-old full-stack developer who&#x27;s been deep in code for the past 10 months.
Since I started, I’ve spent over 3000 hours learning, building, and breaking things on purpose — just to understand how they work. I’ve written over 100,000 lines of code, mostly across full-stack projects.
My main stack:
Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and sometimes Python, Java, or raw HTML/CSS when needed.
I care a lot about:
🧠 Writing clean, maintainable code
🛠️ Building scalable backend architectures
🔍 Debugging smarter, not harder
💡 Turning ideas into real, working systems
Outside of coding, I enjoy thinking about strategy, leadership, and systems — stuff I believe overlaps with building good software.
I&#x27;ll be sharing things I learn here:
Dev experiments
Coding techniques I find useful
Thoughts on mindset and growth as a young dev
I’m still early in my journey, but I’m moving fast — and I’m here to learn and contribute along the way.
Let’s connect ⚡
Feel free to share what you’re working on or learning right now 👇</span>

Hello internet.
Yeah. Another space shooter.

It started simple — thanks to Tech With Tim&#x27;s space shooter tutorial.
military-grade modder on it.
Because why reinvent the wheel…

  🎞️ The Origin Story (feat. Tim)


I googled &quot;how to make a game in Python&quot;.
Tech With Tim popped up, obviously.
Then I looked at my code…
&quot;Cool. Now let&#x27;s break everything and make it mine.&quot;
Python 3 (I&#x27;m chaotic, not primitive)
pygame (aka &quot;Please Save Frequently&quot;)
Sprites? Mostly of Tim and made one myself B)
Music? Scavenged from the depths of royalty-free Google searches
Folders:



assets/ — ships, lasers, vibes
bgm/ — background music that fights back

                              <span>When diving into JavaScript, you&#x27;ll quickly come across different tools that help make your code more efficient and readable. In this post, we’ll explore three essential concepts:
while loop
map() function
arrow functions (&#x3D;&gt;)
Let’s break them down with simple examples.
while Loop


A while loop runs as long as a certain condition is true. It’s useful when you don’t know exactly how many times the loop should run.
while (condition) {
  // code to run
}

let i &#x3D; 0;
while (i  {
  // function body
};

Here’s the same map() example with an arrow function:
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3];
let doubled &#x3D; numbers.map(num &#x3D;&gt; num * 2);

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]

📝 If there’s only one parameter and one expression, you can skip the parentheses and curly braces.
Let’s say you want to double the numbers in an array using a while loop and arrow functions.
let numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4];
let doubled &#x3D; [];

let i &#x3D; 0;
while (i  num * 2)(numbers[i]));
  i++;
}

console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8]</span>

                              <span>In the rush to develop cutting-edge AI agents, one critical skill often gets overlooked: data warehousing. While AI algorithms and machine learning frameworks grab the spotlight, the backbone of any scalable, high-performing AI system lies in how data is structured, stored, and accessed.
A well-designed data warehouse, built on the principles of dimensional modeling, ensures that AI agents can efficiently process vast amounts of data, deliver real-time insights, and adapt to evolving business needs. This article explores why data warehousing and dimensional modeling are indispensable for AI scalability and how their components work together to power intelligent systems.
