                              <span>As remote work continues to rise and cyber threats grow more advanced, organizations are rethinking how they provide secure access to internal systems. For years, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have been the go-to solution for connecting remote employees to corporate networks. But with today’s evolving digital landscape, VPNs are falling short in several key areas—security, performance, and user experience.
While VPNs once offered a reliable way to connect to internal networks, their architecture is no longer ideal for today’s distributed, cloud-first environments. Here are the main reasons organizations are replacing legacy VPNs:
Overly Broad Access: VPNs typically grant access to entire network segments, increasing the risk if credentials are compromised.

                              <span>Imagine if your house had a security system so smart that it not only caught intruders in real time but also locked your doors and called for backup automatically. That’s exactly what Drosera is doing for the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).
So What Exactly Is Drosera?
Whether it’s a bug, an exploit attempt, or a suspicious transaction, Drosera is there to spot it and respond instantly  without waiting for a human to step in.
How Does It Work?
Traps –&gt; The Watchers
These are smart contracts that monitor the blockchain. A Trap is like a detective, always watching what&#x27;s happening and deciding if something looks wrong like an exploit or a contract acting suspiciously.
Each Trap has:
An off chain brain that gathers and analyzes data.
An on-chain trigger that tells a DeFi app to do something when 
needed (like pause trading or freeze funds).
2. Operators –&gt; The Enforcers
But they don’t just jump in blindly. They have to opt into a Trap, proving they’re ready and trusted to do the job. Once they’re in, they help monitor the blockchain and take quick action when needed.
3. Seed Nodes –&gt; The Connectors
Why Drosera Matters
Drosera is built to stop those losses before they happen.
It’s fast, decentralized and automated, meaning there&#x27;s no single point of failure, no waiting around, and no panic buttons. Developers can focus on building while Drosera watches their back.
Who Is Drosera For?
DeFi Developers who want to build apps with security baked in.
Security Researchers who want to deploy automated monitoring 
tools.
Node Operators who want to help protect the ecosystem.
Anyone who cares about making the DeFi space safer for everyone.
Drosera is more than just a tool. It’s a movement toward a more secure, resilient, and self healing DeFi ecosystem.
In a world where billions are on the line, having a decentralized security system like Drosera isn’t a luxury —&gt; IT&#x27;S A NECESSITY.

                              <span>Introduction


Not long ago, I discovered how to query databases using natural language with a tool on VS Code, utilizing Agent Mode combined with PostgreSQL&#x27;s MCP server. Since then, I&#x27;ve had a strong feeling that the era of GenAI-enhanced development tools is imminent. And now, it&#x27;s here...
Microsoft recently announced a new IDE for PostgreSQL in VS Code. You can read more about it here. Additionally, you can find the GitHub repository for the VS Code extension and some helpful guidance here.
Today&#x27;s post aims to demonstrate the connection between my work on querying PostgreSQL using natural language and achieving the same results with Microsoft&#x27;s PostgreSQL VS Code extension.
Make sure you install the VS Code extension as the picture below.

                              <span>🚀 Spent 5 hours automating a 5-minute task... and I regret nothing! 
At work, I kept finding myself manually checking which GraphQL operations from our schema were actually implemented in our codebase. You know the drill - opening the schema file, scrolling through hundreds of queries/mutations, then grep-ing through the entire project to see what&#x27;s actually being used. 
repository
5 minutes per check × multiple times per week &#x3D; death by a thousand paper cuts 📈
So naturally, I did what any self-respecting developer would do: I spent an entire weekend building a tool to automate it! 🛠️
Introducing vite-plugin-graphql-usage - a Vite plugin and CLI tool that:
✅ Introspects your GraphQL schema (endpoint or SDL file)

✅ Scans your codebase for operation usage

✅ Generates beautiful markdown reports with checkboxes

✅ Shows exactly where each operation is used (file + line number)

✅ Integrates seamlessly into your build process  
The best part? It&#x27;s completely non-intrusive - it analyzes your code without modifying anything.
// Just add to your vite.config.ts
viteGraphQLUsages({
  schemaSource: { 
    endpoint: &#x27;https://api.example.com/graphql&#x27; 
  },
  printTable: true,
  saveReport: true
})

Now instead of manual detective work, I get automated reports like this:
📊 GraphQL Operations Report:
✅ Found: 47
❌ Not found: 23  
📊 Total operations: 70

The classic developer paradox: &quot;I&#x27;ll spend 5 hours automating something that takes 5 minutes... because those 5 minutes happen 100 times!&quot; 😅
But honestly? This has already saved our team hours of manual work, helped us identify unused operations to clean up, and made onboarding new developers way smoother.
Sometimes the best solutions come from being just annoyed enough at repetitive tasks to do something about it! 🎯
Check it out: npm install vite-plugin-graphql-usage

Consider the situation: you&#x27;ve spent a considerable amount of time developing an app, either as a personal project or as part of your job, and now it&#x27;s time to share it with your target audience.
Note: here I focus mostly on console apps running on 🐧 Linux and 🍎 MacOS.
CLI apps can be executed either from a directory where the binary is located and it is fine at the development stage or if you share your app with your team, but as an end user, you want the app usage to be as straightforward as possible. Recently, I developed an app for extracting images from PDF documents pdfjuicer which was intended for both manual usage and being integrated into data processing pipelines.
Calling it like this

                              <span>I recently had to build convenience wrappers around producers and consumers for RabbitMQ in a pub-sub architecture.
There are many obstacles to ensuring reliable (at-least-once) message delivery when using a distributed message broker like RabbitMQ.
Messages may be lost between the producer and the broker, inside the broker, and between the broker and consumers. And there are many subtleties.
In a nutshell, you need to enable:
publisher confirms - so that the broker acks messages
message persistence - so that the broker acks messages only after flushing it to disk
durable queues (with a durable exchange) - so that queues survive broker and consumer restarts
consumer acking - so that the queue retains messages until acked by a consumer

  Introduction


This project explores the integration of a traditional reverse shell with an OpenAI-powered Agent. The goal: to issue natural language instructions and have them automatically translated into system-level commands that are executed on a remote machine.
You type:
&quot;List all log files modified today.&quot; 

The system:
Interprets your intent
Infers the operating system
Generates an appropriate shell command
Executes it remotely via a socket
Returns the output, all without manually touching the terminal

In this post, I’ll walk through how I built this system without releasing the entire source code. Instead, I’ll explain the design decisions, the architecture, and include key code excerpts that show the core logic.

After a decade in embedded systems, I&#x27;ve seen countless engineering teams struggle with requirements management tools. For large enterprises, complex systems might justify expensive, feature-laden platforms. But for small, agile teams, these tools often become a hindrance, not a help. My own experience, and industry data, confirms this systemic frustration:
73% of practitioners abandon traceability due to tool complexity [1]

Manual methods fail when managing beyond ~200 requirements [2]

ReqIF-based workflows require 40% more review time than alternatives [3]

                              <span>Alright fellow devs, the AI wave is here, and even us &quot;old school coders&quot; are evolving! I&#x27;ve been shaping my workflow as a Generative Coder, trying to blend decades of experience with the power of tools like Gemini, Claude, GPT, and the speed of Cursor IDE (while still loving WebStorm for its strengths!).
My current process is a 3-step dance:
AI Huddle (with Gemini): Brainstorming needs &amp; context.
Charting the Course: Human-led user flows &amp; requirements.
The Generative Relay: Iterative prompting (Claude in Cursor, GPT/Gemini for second opinions), reviewing, and refining.
It&#x27;s exciting, but I&#x27;m on a mission to make it perfectly efficient – fewer re-prompts, tighter loops, and more time for big-picture design. I’m an engineer, after all; it should be a crystal-clear development process! (Even if that first-shot perfect result from AI is still a dream 😉).
For a more detailed breakdown of my current tools and process, you can read the full post on my blog:

But here on dev.to, I really want to hear from YOU!
What does your AI-assisted workflow look like?
Which tools are you finding indispensable?

According to crypto vesting tracker Tokenomist, $3.3 billion in tokens will be released in June, a 32% decline in unlocked tokens month-on-month. In May, such tokens totaled $4.9 billion.  
Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures. 
The data shows that $1.4 billion in tokens will be released through a “cliff unlock,” while $1.9 billion will be emitted through a “linear unlock.” Cliff unlocks release …</span>

According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt (USDT), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.

Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.
Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. …</span>

On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.
“The only good thing was bread and butter,” Pinto said, adding he left the venue still hungry.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.

                              <span>Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns
US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president …</span>

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
&quot;This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens.&quot;

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm&#x27;s fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.
Cardone told Cointelegraph the impetus to start the fund followed a suggestion from his brother. The CEO said:

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today&#x27;s tran…</span>

                              <span>AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

                              <span>The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.
Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid&#x27;s native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

John Woeltz was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

                              <span>Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov will not be physically attending the Oslo Freedom Forum in Oslo, Norway, after French courts denied his request to travel to the Scandinavian country.
According to an announcement from the Human Rights Foundation (HRF) — a non-profit organization that advocates for universal human rights and individual liberty, and the host of the Oslo Freedom Forum — Durov will still deliver his keynote address remotely over a livestream.
“It is unfortunate that French courts would block Mr. Durov from participating in an event where his voice is so needed,” HRF founder and CEO Thor Halvorssen said.
Durov continues to be a vocal advocate for free speech and individual liberty. Tech and crypto industry executives closely monitor developments related to Pavel Durov and the im…</span>

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.
&quot;These are all scams do not fall for any of these,&quot; Troy Lindsey wrote after receiving a copy of the phishing letter.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors — including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states — is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Canada, Mong said that small businesses including bars, restaurants, convenience stores, and other local operators can generate revenue by hosting wireless hotspots and expanding network coverage.
Large telecommunication companies and service providers can also tap into the Helium Network&#x27;s telemetry to reduce operational costs and expand network coverage in dead zones.
