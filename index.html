                              <span>In the world of modern software delivery, speed and reliability are everything. Users expect features to roll out fast — without downtime or drama. That’s where CI/CD comes in.
In this blog, we’ll break down what CI/CD really is, how it powers DevOps, and walk through a real example so you can see it in action.
CI/CD stands for:
Continuous Integration (CI) – Automating the build and test process every time code is committed.
Continuous Delivery (CD) – Automating the release of that tested code to staging or production.
In simple terms:
You commit code → It’s built and tested → If successful, it’s deployed automatically
This approach avoids the nightmare of last-minute integration hell, ensures bugs are caught early, and allows teams to ship smaller, safer changes more frequently.

                              <span>You&#x27;re shipping reports, invoices, or data exports as PDFs. And they look like they were built in 1998. That might fly internally, but the moment you&#x27;re sending them to clients, investors, or partners, it reflects directly on your brand.
Bad design isn&#x27;t neutral. It kills trust.
With reportgen.io, you can generate stunning PDFs using modern CSS, Tailwind, and Chart.js - without turning your dev team into a design agency.
Here&#x27;s how to go from &quot;ugh&quot; to &quot;damn&quot; in 15 minutes.
If you want tight control and don&#x27;t mind some manual work, you can write vanilla CSS. Think of this like hand-coding an HTML email.

In this guide, we’ll explain Terraform depends_on, how to use it, when to use it, and best practices for writing clean and efficient Terraform code. 
Terraform’s depends_on is a meta-argument that allows you to specify an explicit relationship between resources.  When you use it you can enforce an order in which resources should be created or updated.  
When you configure Terraform, it analyses its dependency graph to understand the relationships between different resources. This graph helps Terraform determine the order in which r…</span>

                              <span>Machine learning is everywhere these days—from the recommendations on Netflix to self-driving cars cruising down the streets. But if you’ve ever tried to dive deeper, you’ve probably come across terms like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. It can get overwhelming, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.
Let’s break it down in simple terms, without the jargon overload, so you can actually understand what these types of machine learning are all about.

1. Supervised Learning: Learning with a Teacher
In supervised learning, the machine is given input data and the correct output (the “label”). It learns from these examples so that, later, when it sees new data, it can predict the right answer.
Common uses:
Spam detection in emails
Predicting house prices
Recognizing handwri…</span>

                              <span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we live, work, and interact with machines. While many people associate AI with robots or voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, the concept runs much deeper. AI refers to the ability of machines or software to mimic human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction. To truly understand AI, it&#x27;s important to recognize that not all AI is the same — it can be categorized into different types based on capabilities and functionalities.
Let’s explore these classifications in detail.
1. Understanding AI Based on Capabilities
b. General AI (Strong AI)

You&#x27;re being tricked. The reality is that LLMs like Claude&#x27;s have no inherent memory between calls. Each API request is stateless by design. When you use the official Claude web interface, it maintains your entire conversation history in the background and sends it with each new request. They are faking memory.
This &quot;memory facade&quot; pattern is fundamental to building any conversational AI application that maintains context over time, whether you&#x27;re using Claude, GPT, or any other LLM. When building your own AI chatbot application, you&#x27;ll need to implement this same pattern:

Imagine a massive cargo ship gliding across the ocean without a single person steering it. This is not science fiction—it is the future of shipping. Autonomous cargo ships are vessels that use artificial intelligence (AI) to navigate the open seas, carrying goods from one country to another without a human captain. In this blog, we will explore how AI is transforming global shipping, how autonomous ships work, and what this means for the future of maritime transportation. We will also include a story about how a simple shipment of food supplies highlighted the importance of accurate route optimization in autonomous shipping.

                              <span>In this article, we&#x27;re going to tackle a common challenge in SQL programming, specifically when working with dynamic SQL statements that involve passing column names and table names as parameters. You may have encountered the error message: &quot;Must declare the table variable &#x27;@tbName&#x27;&quot; while trying to execute a SQL query in your .NET application. Let&#x27;s explore why this error occurs and how to fix it.
Understanding the Issue
The error arises because SQL Server does not allow table names and column names to be passed as parameters in the same way that data values can be. SQL parameters are only for values in SQL queries - they cannot be used to specify table names or column names. As a result, when you attempt to use the @tbName and @colName parameters directly in your SQL string, SQL Server t…</span>

                              <span>A hacker involved in the $4.67 million exploit of the decentralized finance lending protocol Voltage Finance in 2022 has moved some of the stolen Ether to Tornado Cash after a short hibernation. 
Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen 16 days of inflows for the spot BTC ETF, with a further 280 Bitcoin (BTC) or around $36 million piling into the fund on May 6, according to HODL15Capital.  
The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added. 
“IBIT alone has done this in a few weeks, more than a year after launch.”

                              <span>South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung has reportedly become the latest presidential candidate to promise the approval of spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other crypto-friendly measures, should he be elected.
Lee announced his crypto promises on May 6 as part of a broader initiative to provide more investment opportunities for Korea’s youth, one of the main target demographics for the fast-approaching June 3 election.
“I will create a safe investment environment so that young people can [build] assets and plan for the future,” The Korea Economic Daily (KED) quoted Lee as saying in Korean.
He also promised the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, lower transaction fees, and more consumer protection measures.

With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

                              <span>Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

                              <span>Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. 
If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description.

Bitwise named Coinbase Custody as the proposed custodian of the Bitwise NEAR ETF. The management fee, ticker and stock exchange it seeks to list on weren’t named yet.

In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. 
The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

Democrats aim at Trump’s crypto profits with a 3-prong pincer move
US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.   
The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL) failed to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching $156 on April 25, but an assortment of data points suggests that the altcoin’s upside is not over.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. 
The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You&#x27;re not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.
In the simplest terms:

A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your co…</span>

                              <span>For months, Cointelegraph took part in an investigation centered around a suspected North Korean operative that uncovered a cluster of threat actors attempting to score freelancing gigs in the cryptocurrency industry.
The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…</span>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum&#x27;s rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum&#x27;s real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …</span>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.
