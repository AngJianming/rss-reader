Postmark&#x27;s inbound email parsing unlocks that data, turning email into a programmable interface for finance. By combining Postmark&#x27;s reliable email processing with AI-powered analysis, you can automate expense tracking, categorize transactions, and generate personalized insights—without ever touching a spreadsheet.
This project demonstrates how Postmark&#x27;s API makes it possible: email in, structured insights out. Just forward an email, and let the system do the rest.
I built MailBudget — an AI-powered system that transforms your email inbox into a smart financial assistant. It processes your receipts, detects patterns, and sends you actionable financial insights —…</span>

Regression Models Supervised Machine Learning models that are trained to predict the label values based on the training data. In this blog, we will discuss Linear Regression.
Let me first set up the context. Throughout the blog, we will consider a practical example to understand the concept. Considering that we have an existing data of an ice cream shop. The data has 2 columns, one is the average temperature of each day and the second one has the number of ice cream sold.
We are creating an algorithm using this existing data. The algorithm can further be …</span>

Introduction:
Understanding GPUs:
Functionality: GPUs are specialized hardware components designed for parallel processing and graphical computations. They excel in tasks such as rendering 3D graphics, processing images, and handling large datasets.
Applications: Beyond gaming, GPUs are utilized in professional fields like video editing, architectural design, and scientific research, where they provide the computational power needed for complex visualizations.
The Role of AI:
Definition: AI encompasses machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, facial recognition, and decision-making. It involves intricate algorithms and large datasets.

After years of wrestling with spatial data in Rails, my codebase had become a literal zoo—complete with monkeys swinging through monkey patches, chaotic adapter inheritance trees, and compatibility disasters that made upgrades feel like playing Jenga with gorillas. But I&#x27;ve finally escaped the zoo by creating activerecord-postgis, a clean, Rails 8-friendly PostGIS adapter gem. Here’s the real story behind it.
If you’ve handled spatial data in Rails, you know the pain:
Monkey Patches Everywhere: ActiveRecord was mutated beyond recognition.
Inheritance Chaos: Adapter hierarchies tangled beyond belief.
Module Madness: Gems battling each other through aggressive method prepends.
Upgrade Nightmares: Rails upgrades—from 6.1 to 8—left everyt…</span>

It started like any other Saturday. I had errands to run, a to-do list a mile long, and not much patience to go with it. I was in line at the grocery store, checking my phone and barely paying attention, when an elderly woman in front of me turned around and smiled.
“I’m sorry,” she said gently, “I’m moving a bit slow today.”
She had just a few items, but her hands shook as she tried to reach into her bag for change. The people behind me started sighing loudly. Someone muttered,…</span>

This guide dives deep into why burnout hits tech workers differently, how to spot it early, and what you can actually do to recover and prevent it.
Recent studies show that over 60% of tech professionals experience burnout symptoms at some point in their careers. Unlike other industries where burnout might develop gradually, the tech sector&#x27;s unique challenges can accelerate this process, leaving even the most passionate developers feeling depleted and disconnected from their work.
Tech burnout stems from a perfect storm of industry-specific factors that create unsustainable working conditions. …</span>

In recent years, the concept of work has undergone a significant transformation, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions to transition to remote work. As we move into 2026, the idea of a &quot;hybrid office&quot; — where employees can choose between working from home and working in a central office — is not just a trend but a fundamental shift in how we approach productivity, collaboration, and work-life balance.
Here are five key ways hybrid offices are redefining the future of work:
Hybrid work models have democratized access to workspace, allowing employees to work from anywhere — whether it&#x27;s a cozy corner at home or a shared desk in a bustling co-working space. This flexibility is particularly appealing to profession…</span>

In today&#x27;s tech-driven world, operating systems (OS) are the backbone of how we interact with our devices. While there are several OS options available, Linux stands out as a powerful and flexible choice that has captured the attention of both tech enthusiasts and everyday users. If you&#x27;re curious about what Linux is all about, read on to uncover its unique features and why it might just be the right OS for you.
What Is Linux?


Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning it&#x27;s freely available for anyone to use, modify, or enhance. Unlike proprietary software like Windows or macOS, Linux is developed by a global community of contributors. It&#x27;s often celebrated for its flexibility and security, making it a favorite among developers, tech professi…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently started using Claude Pro on the desktop.  It can produce readable reports from a text prompt.  Trouble is it can and will &quot;make up&quot; data.  This is called &quot;Halucinating&quot; in the current AI/LLM discussions.  This is a big problem for most people that just want accurate information!
One way it can interface with your data in a more reliable way is by using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  To greatly simplify what MCP does, it pushes external data into prompts
To get accurate historical financial markets I am using the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) online database via a MCP Server

Honestly, I was skeptical about vibe coding. I only used LLMs to help with a small portion of the code — around 10%.
Why?
That’s not to say I didn’t use it. I did.
    Fix bugs
    Write code for domains I haven’t faced before
    Answer questions I was too lazy to Google
But everything changed when I started building a Phoenician transliteration tool — a website that converts Arabic and English text into the ancient Phoenician script.
And I was doing this in ReactJS... without ever really learning ReactJS.
Sure, I had some experience with Flutter. But building a web app in Flutter felt off. React was calling.
I tested the idea using ChatGPT.
To my surprise, within about two hours, I had a working, decent-looking website.
Sure, I had to adjust some of the mapping logic — the …</span>
