                              <span>At Sliplane, we&#x27;re building the simplest way to run your Dockerized apps in production. No Kubernetes, no YAML jungles, just containers that work. We&#x27;ve been quietly shipping a bunch of new features lately, and it&#x27;s time to share what&#x27;s new under the hood.
Whether you&#x27;re building a SaaS, self-hosting open source tools, or deploying internal workloads, these updates are all about speed, flexibility, and control.
You can now programmatically manage your Sliplane resources via our new API.
Create servers, deploy containers, trigger builds. All from your own scripts, CI pipelines, or internal tools.
ctrl.sliplane.io.

Use case:
Automate spinning up preview environments.
Build your own control dashboard.
Integrate with tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or n8n.

                              <span>Hi there! I&#x27;m Maneshwar. Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a first-of-its-kind tool for helping you automatically index API endpoints across all your repositories. LiveAPI helps you discover, understand, and use APIs in large tech infrastructures with ease.
If you&#x27;ve ever felt overwhelmed by managing multiple servers, configurations, or deployment steps, Ansible is your friend. 
This blog post walks through a real, modular Ansible setup, ideal for developers and DevOps engineers looking to scale smart automation without hacking things together. 
We&#x27;ll also dive into using external roles, tags, loops, handlers, and testing, all tied together in a clean folder structure.

                              <span>Today was all about alignment, validation, and foundation.
We kicked things off with a long Google Meets call — bouncing ideas back and forth, debating what&#x27;s worth building, and asking ourselves what could become a real business after this hackathon. We had a ton of concepts, but ultimately, one idea stood out:
Story Hero — an AI-powered storytelling app that helps parents generate personalized, calming, and educational stories for their kids.
With our vision locked in, Daniel got to work setting up everything we need: accounts for Bolt.new, GitHub, Figma, DEV, and more. No code written yet, but now we’ve got the rails laid to move fast.
Meanwhile, Josh dove into technical exploration. To test our vision, he spun up a quick Node script and evaluated multiple image generation APIs — Stable Diffusion, Gemini, Leonardo, DALL·E 3, and more.
The key problem: art style consistency across story pages — something most tools struggle with.
Eventually, we found a promising lead: Image Gen 1, which allows for coherent visuals using a single reference image. The trick? Frame the image generation as a conversation with the AI, using the title to maintain consistent context and style — even while processing multiple pages in parallel.
We also added concurrency and batching to keep generation fast without sacrificing consistency.
On the UX side, we researched bedtime-focused UI/UX design. Since our app is meant for wind-down moments with kids, we decided on a calming dark theme inspired by dreamy, sleepy-time palettes from Dribbble. With help from ChatGPT, we rapidly iterated on ideas and built out initial views in Figma.
We&#x27;re just getting started — but the vision is clear. This isn&#x27;t just a hackathon app. We&#x27;re here to build something real. Story Hero is about reclaiming screen time for creativity, imagination, and connection.
More tomorrow.
✨ Let’s make bedtime magical again.

The world of application development is undergoing a seismic shift, a transformation driven by the potent combination of low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms and the burgeoning intelligence of Generative AI (GenAI). What was once a realm exclusive to seasoned developers is rapidly democratizing, empowering a new wave of creators to build sophisticated applications with unprecedented speed and ease. This isn&#x27;t just an evolution; it&#x27;s a revolution, and GenAI is its electrifying catalyst, reshaping how we think about, design, and deploy software solutions.
The promise of LCNC platforms has always been to abstract away the complexities of traditional coding, allowing users to build applications through visual interfaces…</span>

If you’re a web developer, you’ve probably heard of Svelte
And with SvelteKit, it’s not just UI anymore. It’s a full-stack framework that handles routing, server-side rendering, API routes, static site generation, and more — all while keeping things simple and fast.
I’ve been working with Svelte for over six months, from just before Svelte 4 through Svelte 5. Honestly, it’s been one of the most refreshing developer experiences I’ve had.
Why? Because Svelte doesn’t trap you in heavy ecosystems or rigid patterns. It’s just clean JavaScript, enhanced by features like:

This is the structured path I&#x27;m following as I learn DevOps, step by step. It’s also a reference guide for anyone starting from scratch who needs direction and wants to learn in public 🚀.
I&#x27;ll update this roadmap with new milestones, resources, and tutorials (including one on setting up virtual machines manually and using Vagrant, which is coming soon!).
Understand what DevOps is and why it matters
Learn the DevOps lifecycle and key concepts (CI/CD, automation, collaboration)
What is DevOps – AWS
Learn how to create and manage VMs manually
Use Vagrant to provision VMs consistently
