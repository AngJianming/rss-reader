                              <span>It’s been well over a year since the dreaded voltage spike issue plagued Intel’s top-tier 13th and 14th Gen Core i9 processors and caused irreversible damage pre-BIOS patch. And just when we thought we’d heard the last of it, one YouTuber is claiming that the problem has returned, this time for AMD’s Ryzen 9000 Series […]

                              <span>A major Chinese darknet marketplace suspected of facilitating crypto scams and cybercrime has been shut down by the Telegram messaging service, upon which it operated.
The internet’s largest illicit marketplace, Haowang Guarantee, formerly Huione Guarantee, said it will shut down following Telegram’s ban of thousands of associated accounts on May 13. 
“Since all our NFTs, channels and groups were blocked by Telegram on May 13, 2025, Haowang Guarantee will cease operations from now on,” read the notice on the marketplace website.
A report from Wired said that this involved banning thousands of accounts and usernames that served as the infrastructure for the crypto crime marketplace and its vendors.

Law enforcement has been increasingly successful at tracing stolen funds and crypto ransom payments, resulting in a “lot of arrests,” Levin said during the 2025 Consensus crypto conference, covered by Cointelegraph.
“For whatever reason, there is a perception that’s out there that crypto is an asset that is untraceable, and that really lends itself to criminals acting in a certain way,” he said. 
“Apparently, the know that crypto is not untraceable hasn&#x27;t been received by some of the organized crime groups that are actually perpetrating these attacks, and some of them are concentrated in, you know, France, b…</span>

“We are always looking at M&amp;A opportunities,” said Armstrong on Bloomberg Television on May 14.
He added that the firm has a large balance sheet that can be put to use.
The firm revealed in its latest revenue report that its balance sheet has strengthened, ending the first quarter with $9.9 billion in US dollar resources.
“Part of the benefit of being a public company is, you have a liquid currency to do that,” he said, adding: “We are looking at acquisition opportunities; doesn’t mean we swing at every pitch. We want it to be the right opportunity.”

The money laundering services were allegedly carried out on behalf of other criminal networks engaged in migrant smuggling and drug trafficking, Europol said in a May 14 statement.
Spanish authorities said the criminal organization ran a secret informal money transfer system called hawala and was often compensated in crypto.
A total of 17 individuals were arrested — 15 in Spain, one in Austria and one in Belgium — while 4.5 million euros ($5 million) worth of items were seized, including cash, crypto, 18 vehicles, four shotguns and several electronic devices.

“For some reason, founders and CEOs think that they should be raising capital at 50 to 80 times revenue. So that makes it very hard for us to make a return for our liquidity providers,” Tapeiro said while speaking in a panel discussion at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 14.
“So a lot of those deals we just pass almost automatically, even businesses that we really like, we won&#x27;t invest in if the price isn&#x27;t reasonable in the beginning.”

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Google search data and app rankings show retail Bitcoin investor demand near 6-month lows.

Retail investor interest typically peaks 1 week after BTC breaks all-time highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) retail traders are known for entering the market during periods of euphoria, typically after strong monthly gains or a new all-time high. This time is no different, with Bitcoin approaching $104,000 on May 14 while general public interest and retail activity continue to lag.
Analysts estimate that in 2025, retail investors were the largest net sellers of BTC, while institutions were the main buyers. But if historical patterns hold, a surge in retail appetite is likely to occur about one week after Bitcoin surpasses the $109,350 mark.

This post is part of the Transformations in Reactivity series — an exploration of how ideas from modern signal-based systems (like SolidJS 2.0) can be extended to event-based reactivity.
In this chapter, we focus on async coordination: giving event systems the same structural lifecycle handling that createAsync brought to signals — including pending state, error propagation, and scoped retries.
Signals and events each approach async behavior differently — and each has its limitations.
Signals are synchronous. They represent current state and return values immediately, but can&#x27;t represent &quot;waiting&quot; unless the developer adds manual flags or wrappers.
Events, on the other hand, are naturally asynchronous. They push values over time — but th…</span>

In modern web applications, especially those using Java with Spring Boot, securing endpoints effectively while maintaining usability is crucial. The issue you&#x27;re facing revolves around configuring method security so that it uses authentication everywhere except for a few specified endpoints. This is a common challenge, and understanding how to navigate Spring Security&#x27;s configurations can help simplify your security strategy while minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
Understanding Spring Security Configuration
Spring Security provides a powerful and flexible mechanism to secure web applications. In your configuration, .anyRequest().authenticated() is often recommended to secure all endpoints, ensuring that users are authenticated before access is granted. However, as you&#x27;ve r…</span>

This talk is about objects and arrows that point to objects. And you will see a lot of that throughout the talk
Last year I learned that functional programming is a great tool to learn Physics, because it’s a great way to write math. 
You see, Physics is expressed in the language of Math. 
With this talk, I hope to explain Newton’s second law, describing the problem through types and writing math as code to help us compute functions.  This is a new perspective on learning Functional Programming and/or Physics.

                              <span>What Are Computer Networks?


A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources. Think of it as the digital nervous system that connects computers, phones, servers, and more—allowing data to flow like information highways.
Used in homes, schools, and offices. Connects devices in a small area.
Covers a large geographic area. The Internet is the biggest WAN.
Covers a city or a large campus. Larger than LAN but smaller than WAN.
Your Bluetooth devices form a PAN—like your phone and earbuds.
Router: Directs data packets between networks.
Switch: Connects multiple devices in a LAN.
Modem: Connects to your ISP and provides internet access.
Access Point: Enables wireless devices to connect to the network.
Server &amp; Client: Server provides, client consumes services/data.
Physical
Data Link
Network
Transport
Session
Presentation
Application
Each layer has a specific role—from moving bits to enabling web apps.
More practical and used in real-world networking:
Link
Internet
Transport
Application
HTTP/HTTPS – Web browsing
FTP/SFTP – File transfers
SMTP/IMAP/POP3 – Email
TCP/UDP – Data transport
IP – Routing and addressing
DNS – Resolves domain names to IPs
Whether you&#x27;re streaming Netflix, sending a meme, or backing up your files to the cloud—computer networks make it all happen. They&#x27;re the silent enablers of our digital lives.
🧠 Fun Fact: The first message ever sent over the ARPANET (the Internet’s ancestor) was &quot;LO&quot;—they meant to type &quot;LOGIN&quot; but the system crashed!
Stay tuned, stay connected, and maybe ping your friend instead of ghosting them.
Tools That Help: Wireshark, Cisco Packet Tracer, Netcat, Nmap, and a whole lot of curiosity.</span>

                              <span>What is a Callback?


A callback is a function passed into another function, to be called later when something happens or a task is finished.
Analogy:

Imagine you order food and give the restaurant your phone number so they can call you when your food is ready. Your phone number is the callback.
JavaScript is single-threaded and often needs to wait for things (like loading data or waiting for a user action).

Instead of stopping everything, it uses callbacks to say, “Do this later, when the waiting is done.”
function doSomethingLater(callback) {  
console.log(&quot;Doing something...&quot;);  
callback();  
}  

function sayHello() {  
console.log(&quot;Hello, I&#x27;m the callback!&quot;);  
}  

doSomethingLater(sayHello);  

Output:
Doing something...  
Hello, I&#x27;m the callback!  

doSomethingLater(function() {  
console.log(&quot;This is an inline callback!&quot;);  
});  

setTimeout and setInterval
setTimeout(function() {  
console.log(&quot;This runs after 2 seconds&quot;);  
}, 2000);  

Event Listeners
button.addEventListener(&#x27;click&#x27;, function() {  
console.log(&quot;Button clicked!&quot;);  
});  

Fetching Data (with Promises, but still uses callbacks)
fetch(&#x27;https://api.example.com/data&#x27;)  
.then(function(response) {  
return response.json();  
})  
.then(function(data) {  
console.log(data);  
});  

Callbacks are not always asynchronous.

Some callbacks are called right away.


Callbacks are just functions.

There’s nothing special about them except how they’re used.




  
  
  Callback Cheat Sheet


Definition:

A callback is a function you pass to another function to be called later.
Basic Example:
function callback() { ... }  
someFunction(callback);  

Anonymous Example:
someFunction(function() { ... });  

Typical Uses:
setTimeout, setInterval


Event handling (like clicks)


Fetching data from APIs



Key Point:

Callbacks help JavaScript handle tasks that take time, so your code can keep running without waiting.</span>

In Day-27, we:
Flashed Raspberry Pi OS (Lite) onto a microSD card

Enabled SSH by adding a file to /boot

(Optionally) added Wi-Fi credentials via wpa_supplicant.conf

Inserted the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and powered it on
Ran nmap to identify the Pi’s IP — but couldn’t connect via SSH

                              <span>Key Takeaways: 

Dogecoin&#x27;s active addresses surged 528% to 469,477.

DOGE’s futures open interest rose 70% to $1.65 billion, indicating strong speculative interest.

On May 13, Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a staggering 528% increase in active addresses, soaring from 74,640 to 469,477, signaling robust network activity and growing investor interest. This surge followed an update to 21Shares’ filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, receiving acknowledgement from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The financial services firm confirmed the development on X on May 14.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

A longer-term ETH price rally is dependent on SEC approval of in-kind ETF creation and staking to attract more investors. 

AI adoption and Ethereum layer-2 growth must drive onchain activity to restore the network’s deflationary burn mechanism.

Ether (ETH) surged 43.6% between May 7 and May 14, but its current price of $2,600 still falls short of the 2021 peak of $4,868. Some analysts argue that the current bullish momentum is “just the beginning of a much larger and aggressive uptrend,” raising the likelihood of a near-term rally to $5,000.
However, the catalysts for a new ETH all-time high in 2025 remain uncertain, particularly in the face of intensifying competition.

                              <span>Bitfarms clocked a first-quarter net loss of $36 million, widening from a $6 million loss in the same period a year earlier, as the Bitcoin miner pivots from mining to high-performance computing for artificial intelligence applications. 
The miner posted $67 million in sales for the quarter ended March 31, up 33% from the year prior. However, gross profit margin for Bitfarm’s mining operations declined to 43% from 63% year-over-year, the company said in its first quarter earnings release. 
The lower margins reflect pressure from Bitcoin’s (BTC) April 2024 “halving” as well as volatility in Bitcoin’s price. Halvings occur every four years and cut the number of BTC mined per block in half, reducing Bitcoin miners’ profitability.

                              <span>Crypto founders headed to Washington, DC, to meet with lawmakers ahead of another expected vote on a stablecoin bill that initially failed in the Senate, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 
In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. 
The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. 
From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.
Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.

Bitcoin’s realized cap has grown by $30 billion since April 20, reflecting steady investor confidence and new capital inflows.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post, Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May. The current realized cap is $900 billion.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe&#x27;s crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider:
“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”

                              <span>Update (May 14 at 6:58 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from the Blockchain Association.
Summer Mersinger, one of four commissioners currently serving at the US financial regulatory body Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will become the next CEO of the digital asset advocacy group the Blockchain Association (BA). 
In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would step down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2. Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the BA said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.

Despite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. 
Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. 
Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. 
The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private …</span>

According to a May 14 France24 report, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has invited crypto professionals to meet him after a brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.
”I will assemble businesspeople working in cryptocurrencies, and we have a few of those in France, at the interior ministry to work with them on their security,” Retailleau reportedly told the Europe 1/CNews broadcaster.
On May 13, three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter while she was walking in Paris’ 11th district with a man and her son. The attackers…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Fake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.

Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.

The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.

The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.
Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam.
