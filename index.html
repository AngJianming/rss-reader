  Prerequisites


I am assuming that Ruby is already installed in your system. In this example, we will be using Ruby v3.4.4
We will be using Money example for TDD.
Create a new directory called Money.
Create Gemfile file inside the directory and add only one line: https://rubygems.org.
Run bundle add rspec to install Rspec gem. You will notice that Gemfile is modified and Gemfile.lock is created.
Create two new directories called spec and lib

🔹 What is Spring Framework?
Spring is a Java-based framework used to create enterprise-level applications. It helps you write clean, maintainable, testable, and loosely-coupled code.
🧱 Core Concepts in Spring Framework
Term    Meaning
IoC (Inversion of Control)  Framework controls object creation, not the developer.
🧠 Why Use Spring?
Feature Benefit
✅ Lightweight Not heavy like other frameworks
📸 IMAGE: Spring Architecture Diagram
🔗 Spring Architecture Source – JavaTpoint
🕰️ Old Spring vs New Spring Boot – Full Table
Feature Old Spring  Spring Boot
🔧 Setup  Manual config using XML Auto-configured with annotations
📂 Spring Framework Modules (Core)
Module  Description

🔗 Full module diagram
🔍 Understanding Dependency Injection (DI)
Example:
public class Student {
public Student(String name) {
    this.name &#x3D; name;
}

}

Here, instead of creating Student manually, Spring injects it for you.

Today, I&#x27;d like to share some insights from a project I&#x27;ve been involved with – an AI cartoon generation platform. The aim is to provide a straightforward approach for anyone interested in using such tools.
This web-based platform is designed to simplify the process of creating cartoon-style images using artificial intelligence. The initial concept explored AI and character interaction, but we observed a strong interest in direct generation capabilities. This led to the development of the platform with a focus on enabling users to produce their own AI-generated …</span>

And if there’s one area that can either make or break your chances, it&#x27;s how well you understand databases. Knowing which database to use and why can set you apart as a thoughtful, skilled engineer who understands trade-offs, scalability, and real-world architecture decisions.
In this article, I’ll walk you through 10 essential types of databases that every developer, especially those preparing for system design interviews, should know. These are not just definitions; these are insights that will help you speak the language of system design with confidence and clarity.

                              <span>React Native’s new design is a big improvement over the old way it worked. Instead of using a slow &quot;bridge&quot; to talk between JavaScript and native code, it now uses a faster system called JSI (JavaScript Interface). It also adds TurboModules and a new way to draw screens called the Fabric Renderer.
Thanks to these updates, apps run faster, look more consistent, and can connect better with native features (like camera or GPS). This document explains the different layers and how the parts of a modern React Native SDK work together using this new system.

                              <span>As product builders, we know that a strong foundation is crucial for any successful project. In the world of user experience (UX) design, wireframes serve as that essential blueprint. They&#x27;re the skeletal framework that allows us to map out user flows, information architecture, and core functionality before diving into the visual nitty-gritty.
But how do you create wireframes that aren&#x27;t just functional, but seamless? Wireframes that effortlessly guide your team, stakeholders, and ultimately, your users, through the intended experience? In this article, we&#x27;ll explore a methodical approach to crafting seamless wireframes in Figma, transforming them from static screens into dynamic representations of your product&#x27;s journey.

Yes, ChatGPT can write your emails and summarize documents.
Build a business from scratch
Manage your entire content pipeline
Automate your freelance workflow
Write AND debug code
Help launch and market a SaaS product in days?
Sounds unreal? It’s not. It’s already happening. And those who understand how to leverage AI as a power tool are sprinting miles ahead of everyone else.
In 2025, the smartest people aren’t just using AI — they’re stacking tools and building systems:
🔧 ChatGPT + Zapier: Automate everything from CRM entries to email campaigns
Claude + Notion: Research, summarize, and organize long-form content
Midjourney + Canva: Create stunning visuals and thumbnails in minutes
Replit + GPT-4: Build and deploy full-stack apps without hiring developers
AI Prompts: Train ChatGPT to act as your mentor, editor, marketer, and coach
If you&#x27;re only using AI to write tweets or generate text, you&#x27;re sitting on a goldmine without a shovel.
One of the biggest misconceptions?
“I need to be technical to benefit from AI.”
Nope.
anyone can build functional, monetizable products in a weekend — no CS degree needed.
📖 I just dropped a detailed guide that shows exactly how people are using AI to:
Save 10+ hours/week
Generate income streams
Scale their content game
Build MVPs in days
Learn faster than ever

                              <span>Hi, I got my old VGA card black/blank display when using Ubuntu 24.04. On Windows 10 it is work perfectly on 1440p (2K) resolution.
Here is my VGA card:
$ lspci -k -d ::03xx                                                                                                                                      
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Caicos [Radeon HD 6450/7450/8450 / R5 230 OEM]                                  │
        Subsystem: Bitland(ShenZhen) Information Technology Co., Ltd. Radeon HD 6450                                                                      
        Kernel driver in use: radeon                                                                                                                      
        Kernel modules: radeon, amdgpu 

This old card correctly use radeon driver instead of newer amdgpu driver. I also can confirm driver is works well by executing DRI_PRIME&#x3D;1 glxgears while monitoring Radeon GPU usage with radeontop utility.

But still monitor will be blank if change from onboard Intel GPU (i915) to Radeon GPU on PCIe interface. 😭
After days of googling, go to forums, try and error. ChatGPT is life saver 😃
Here options need to grub config /etc/default/grub to fix those issue:
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT&#x3D;&quot;quiet splash&quot;
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT&#x3D;&quot;radeon.si_support&#x3D;1 radeon.cik_support&#x3D;1 amdgpu.si_support&#x3D;0 amdgpu.cik_support&#x3D;0 radeon.dpm&#x3D;0 radeon.audio&#x3D;0 radeon.modeset&#x3D;1&quot;

It now my monitor can display 2560x1440p (2K) again. yay...🎉</span>

By the end of these two days, I gained a solid understanding of how to add smooth, engaging animations to websites using just CSS — no JavaScript required!

Balcony said on May 28 that it signed a five-year deal with the Bergen County Clerk’s Office to tokenize 370,000 deeds on the Avalanche blockchain, adding that this was “the largest blockchain-based deed tokenization project in US history.”
Bergen County is New Jersey’s most populous county and is located northwest of Manhattan in New York City across the Hudson River. Bergen County has nearly 1 million residents, producing around $500 million in annual property tax revenue.

In earnings released May 28 for its first quarter of the 2026 fiscal year ended April 27, Nvidia reported revenues of $44.1 billion, up 12% from its previous quarter and 69% from a year ago and beating Zacks analyst estimates of $42.91 billion by nearly 2.7%.
However, the chip maker posted an earnings per share of 81 cents, missing analyst estimates of 85 cents per share. Nvidia recorded a net income of $18.8 billion, up 26% compared to a year ago.

Onchain data shared with Cointelegraph by the class group’s lawyer, Max Burwick, shows nearly $57 million worth of USDC (USDC) was frozen on May 28 after a Manhattan court agreed to a temporary freeze.
“Yesterday, a federal court in SDNY [Southern District of New York] entered a Temporary Restraining Order at our request, Burwick Law, supported by Tim Treanor, freezing approximately 57.65 million USDC held at Circle,“ Burwick told Cointelegraph.
He added that the court is scheduled to hold a hearing on June 9 to determine whether the assets will remain frozen as the class-action lawsuit progresses.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.
The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²&#x3D;0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

Vance highlighted the strategic and geopolitical importance of Bitcoin, emphasizing that the US should maintain leadership in the crypto industry to remain competitive in the age of digital finance. Vance told the audience:
&quot;What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we do not make the right decisions. The first thing that I would ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams.

Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …</span>

                              <span>Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?            
            
                
Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.
Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home.
Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you&#x27;ve seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

In a May 28 request for comment, the United Kingdom’s financial regulator announced that its regulatory proposals are “the latest milestone on the road to crypto regulation.” The draft rules are based on prior roundtables and industry feedback. David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:

                              <span>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. 
Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

Gooner EMA is a technical indicator created by trader NebraskanGooner that uses the 11- and 22-period exponential moving averages (EMA). When the price crosses above the EMA range, it often leads to further gains. 
When the price closes below the EMA range, it tends to follow deeper losses.

Durov said in a May 28 X post that he and Musk agreed to a one-year partnership for Telegram to distribute Grok across Telegram and integrate it into its apps.
Musk replied to the post hours later, saying that “no deal has been signed,” to which Durov clarified that the deal was “agreed in principle, but formalities are pending.”
As part of the agreement, Telegram will receive $300 million in cash and equity from Musk’s AI company, in addition to 50% of revenue from xAI subscriptions sold via Tel…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP’s falling wedge pattern signals a bullish reversal; 48% price surge potential.

SEC’s review of WisdomTree’s XRP ETF may spark investor interest as approval odds jump to 84% on Polymarket.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?
XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40
From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.

                              <span>GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account.
The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin (BTC) or when the purchases were made in the announcement, while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.
The announced acquisition is GameStop&#x27;s first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.
