The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22.
The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP (XRP) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana (SOL) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards.
Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that both delays were expected as the SEC “typically take…</span>

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam.
“After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’”
Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.”

“We have experts right here, and they are going to help us navigate solutions that serve our city,” he added. “The age of tokenization, which includes crypto and blockchain and other fintech innovations, that age is here, and we’re going to continue to move forward with it.”

SEC Division of Enforcement associate director Mark Cave claimed that starting in 2022, the trio “exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be back…</span>

The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities — which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year.

There’s a Marathi phrase that haunts me:
“आरंभी शूर” — brave only at the beginning.
That’s been me.
Every few weeks, I would ignite a new initiative.
And then…
The energy would dip.
I wasn&#x27;t lazy. I was just undisciplined.
start.
Why I Started Strong


Because beginnings are easy.
Starting made me feel in control.
So I jumped to the next thing, chasing clarity where none existed.
What It Cost Me



A backlog of 80% complete initiatives
Loss of credibility with my own team
Technical debt disguised as momentum
Incomplete loops in validation, delivery, and feedback
And most painfully — a reputation for “getting things started”
But never enough for “getting things done.”
Code, Culture, and Closure


I prided myself on innovation. But what I needed was consistency.
closure.
Code went unchecked.
This isn’t just a workflow issue.
me issue.
What I’m Doing Now


I’ve decided to break this cycle.
No new initiatives until old ones are closed.
No task is “done” until validated, tested, and documented.
No PR is merged unless reviewed — fully, fearlessly.
Daily logs, closure reports, and personal audits.
Not for the team. For me. To remind myself:
Shipping &gt; Starting. Always.
This post is not a motivational speech.
I am the bottleneck.
No more आरंभी शूर.
Finish what I start.</span>

                              <span>When an API is loading slowly, there could be multiple reasons behind it. Here’s a breakdown of common causes and what they mean:
⚙️ 1. Client-Side Issues
🐢 Slow internet connection (e.g., poor mobile data or Wi-Fi)
🕰️ Blocking synchronous code on the frontend, like large loops or animations that freeze UI
📦 Rendering too much data at once (e.g., a huge React table without pagination or virtualization)
❌ No loading indicators, which can make users feel the app is slower even if it isn’t
🌐 2. Network Issues
High latency due to physical distance between client and server
Network congestion or packet loss slowing requests
Firewall or proxy issues blocking or delaying requests
🖥️ 3. Server-Side Issues
Server overloaded and can’t handle many concurrent requests
Synchronous/blocking operations in business logic causing delays
Database slow queries or locks slowing down responses
Not using asynchronous processing where appropriate
📈 4. Design and Architectural Factors
API not designed for scalability or optimized for quick responses
Missing or inefficient caching mechanisms
Too many unnecessary data payloads increasing transfer size
📡 5. External Factors
Third-party services or APIs called inside your API causing delays
Geographic location mismatch causing longer data travel times

                              <span>In the fascinating world of computer vision, segmentation isn&#x27;t just about cutting images into pieces—it&#x27;s about giving meaning and structure to every single pixel. But not all segmentation is created equal. There are four primary types, each serving a distinct purpose and offering increasing levels of detail and understanding.
At its most fundamental level, Image Segmentation divides an image into logical groups of pixels based on criteria like color, texture, or intensity. Think of it as drawing boundaries around areas with shared characteristics.
Groups pixels into regions (e.g., &quot;this blob is a tree&quot;).
Outputs contours (outlines) or masks (filled areas).
Uses pseudo-coloring to differentiate segments visually.
Isolate distinct pixel groupings without assigning semantic meaning.

We&#x27;ve all been there. That moment when you&#x27;re juggling multiple platforms, trying to deploy your application while managing databases, setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring monitoring systems, and still attempting to keep track of documentation. Your desk looks like the command center of a complicated space mission, with multiple terminals open, dozens of browser tabs, and maybe even that trusty notepad filled with credentials and commands.
And then something breaks.
You spend the next three hours debugging, only to discover it was a simple configuration mismatch between your local environment and production. Sound familiar?

For over a decade, at DoozieSoft, we built. We delivered. We grew. But amidst the commits and deployments, one critical piece kept slipping through the cracks — Validation.
Not validation of forms or user inputs — we had those.
But the real validation loop:
What was tasked vs. what the developer understood

What was built vs. what the client wanted

What was tested vs. what was shipped

What was reviewed vs. what was merged



This silent fracture led to a systemic dysfunction:
Code was written without clarity, merged without critique, and shipped without accountability.

A place where you can find all the libraries and programs that suit your Ziglang needs. - Rohan Vashisht
There have been 2 main goals of Zigistry:
Speed, secure, ease of use, to the point
$0 investment, funds (except the domain name itself)
But how can I achieve all this without even investing a dollar?
Context: On 22nd June 2024, I was having a conversation on the Zig discord server on how I can fix a few errors in my morse code library for Zig, when I asked how I can put it on a Zig package manager, I realized there wasn&#x27;t a place like that.
By the next day, I had created the first version of Zigistry in Preact (a 3KB alternative to React). With a backend (cron job) code that would fetch the packages from GitHub and store them directly…</span>

• Cloud Enablement: We help extend AS400 capabilities by integrating with cloud platforms for better scalability and data accessibility.
• Process Automation: By automating manual workflows within your legacy environment, we help reduce errors and increase operational efficiency.
• Ongoing Support &amp; Maintenance: United Techno ensures your system runs reliably with performance tuning, upgrades, and dedicated support.
The AS400 is still a strong and secure system—but to keep pace with today’s digital demands, businesses need to evolve it with purpose. With United Techno as your partner, you don’t have to choose between legacy stability and innovation. You can have both.

                              <span>Exception handling in PHP has evolved significantly with PHP 8, giving developers powerful tools to manage errors more efficiently. If you&#x27;re working with PHP, understanding how try-catch blocks work and how to handle exceptions correctly is essential for writing robust and maintainable code.
Exception handling is the process of managing errors or unexpected behavior in a program. In PHP, this is typically done using the try-catch construct. The try block contains code that might throw an exception, while the catch block handles the exception. With the latest updates in PHP 8, this process has become more streamlined and developer-friendly.
One of the key improvements in PHP 8 is its support for multi-catch blocks. This means you can now catch multiple exception types in a single catch cla…</span>

  Introduction: Beyond indexOf – The Need for Smarter Search


Have you ever wondered how Google, Amazon, or even your code editor provides lightning-fast autocomplete suggestions as you type? Or how they efficiently filter through millions of product names or variable names in milliseconds? While simple string matching (like String.prototype.indexOf() or iterating through an array) works for small datasets, it quickly becomes inefficient as your data grows.
As web developers, we constantly deal with search functionality – from user input in search bars to filtering data tables on the backend. This is where a powerful Data Structure called a Trie (pronounced &quot;try,&quot; like &quot;tree&quot;) comes into play. Also kno…</span>

Let’s explore how GenQE is not just improving QA, but transforming it into a modern, intelligent, and agile discipline.
Manual testing and outdated automation scripts have become bottlenecks in modern development cycles. Here’s why:
❌ Test cases are often outdated or duplicated.
❌ Limited test coverage leads to missed defects.
❌ Manual effort is time-consuming and error-prone.
❌ Feedback loops are too slow for today’s agile teams.
These challenges cause unnecessary delays, increase risk, and ultimately impact the end-user experience.

SEC sues Unicoin, executives alleging $100 million fraud
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Unicoin and three of the crypto platform’s executives on May 20, alleging they made false and misleading statements about crypto assets that raised $100 million from investors.
The SEC charged Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez with misleading investors about certificates that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock.

In a May 19 X post, Sun said he had received an invitation to attend Trump’s dinner at his golf club outside Washington, DC, as part of a reward for the top 220 memecoin holders. The Tron founder claimed he controlled the top wallet on the TRUMP token leaderboard under the username “Sun,” which held roughly $19 million worth of the memecoin at a price of $13.20.
According to Sun, he plans to network at the May 22 memecoin dinner, “talk crypto,” and “discuss the future” of the industry. It’s unclear why the Tron founder chose to annou…</span>

Bitcoin futures open interest hit a record $72 billion, signaling rising use of leverage among institutional investors.

$1.2 billion in shorts at $107,000 to $108,000 are at risk of liquidation, boosting BTC’s breakout odds.

The aggregate open interest in Bitcoin (BTC) futures surged to a record high on May 20, raising questions about whether bearish positions are now at risk. Despite repeated failures to break above the $107,000 level since May 18, the sheer volume of leveraged positions could propel Bitcoin to a new all-time high.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout above $3,600.

If ETH reclaims the 2-week Gaussian Channel mid-line, a 90% rally could occur.

Ethereum (ETH) price is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,750 on its daily chart, forming a bull flag pattern with sights on the $3,000 to $3,100 resistance zone. A bull flag is a continuation pattern that follows a sharp rally (black flagpole) to $2,730 from $1,900, with the current range forming the flag.

A bullish breakout above $2,600 could target $3,600, which is calculated by adding the flagpole height to the breakout point, but the immediate key area of interest remains between the resistance range at $3,100-$3,000.

According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

                              <span>Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. 
Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.

“The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read.

The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2&#x27;s structural frameworks.

A “German Government (BKA)” labeled cryptocurrency wallet sold 49,858 Bitcoin (BTC) worth over $2.89 billion at an average price of $57,900 across multiple transactions during June and July in 2024.
The decision to sell the Bitcoin early cost the German government over $2.35 billion, according to crypto intelligence platform Arkham.

“If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24B,” Arkham said in a May 19 X post, noting that Bitcoin has risen more than 80% since the sale.
At the time of publication, Bitcoin was trading at more than $104,700, according to CoinMarketCap data.

“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.

Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.
