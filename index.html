                              <span>📅 Day 1 – Kickoff, Chaos &amp; Clarity
I spent the day diving into the hackathon rules, themes, and community discussions to get a feel for what’s expected and what others are thinking about. It’s always exciting (and a bit overwhelming) at the start—so many possibilities, and only 31 days to build something that clicks.
🧠 Brainstorming Time
Could I build something that automates a pain point in my own workflow?


Can this project use AI in a meaningful way—without just throwing in ChatGPT?


What’s something super fast and simple that helps people but could scale?



I kept circling around the idea of speed and utility—core values of Bolt.new.
💡 Shortlisted Ideas
ZERO ideas. Still brewing....
Still deciding which to commit to tomorrow—but already feeling a direction forming.
🎯 Goal for Tomorrow (Day 2)
Draft a rough feature list / user flow.
Choose a tech stack that matches my strengths but pushes me a bit to learn something new.
That&#x27;s all for today, check in back for Day 2!</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been hiring developers for over 10 years—initially as a senior engineer, and for the last two years, as a dedicated technical recruiter. During that time, I’ve reviewed dozens of take-home projects, attended numerous whiteboard sessions, and observed the evolution of interview trends.
But lately, something’s changed.
Candidates are using AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to pass technical interviews, often in ways that bypass actual engineering judgment. I’m not against AI—it&#x27;s a powerful tool when used responsibly. But when it&#x27;s used to mask a candidate’s true skill level, it undermines the purpose of technical hiring.
This article outlines some practical strategies and observations I’ve developed to help design interviews that are fairer, more insightful, and harder to game w…</span>

Support tickets…
Nobody really loves either writing or much worse reading them. And managing them is much much worse than managing my laundry, and that is a really high bar to pass.
So, in a world where we all are writing and summarising emails for the sake of maintaining formality, automating support tickets seems like the logical next step.
And sure there are companies that do this… not really going to name them, but my vision here was to just create something that takes the unorganized text and convert it to organized boxes, while still being pretty to look at… cough Jira cough.
Meet EmailTicket. Firstly hoping that marks are not being deducted for the lack of naming creativity, it&#x27;s here to do exactly what it says. Crea…</span>

I&#x27;m excited to share my recent project, the Smart City Pulse Dashboard, which I built as a submission for the Summer of Scribbling 2025 Hackathon hosted by @ScribblerApp.
The Problem I Aimed to Solve
My Solution: The Smart City Pulse Dashboard
Key Features:
Real-time Environmental Monitoring: Visualizes Air Quality Index (AQI) trends over time and current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
HTML &amp; CSS: For the dashboard&#x27;s structure and sleek, dark-themed UI.
Predictive analytics for upcoming weather and AQI trends.

                              <span>The Problem: RAG That Searches for Everything


Traditional RAG systems have a glaring issue: they search for everything. User asks about pizza recipes? Search the knowledge base. Wants to know the weather? Search again. Having a casual conversation? Yep, another search.
This shotgun approach leads to:
Irrelevant context cluttering the LLM&#x27;s input
Higher costs from unnecessary searches and longer prompts
Slower responses due to constant database hits
Confused AI trying to make sense of unrelated documents
What if the AI could decide for itself when it actually needs to search?
Agentic RAG flips the script. Instead of automatically searching on every query, we give the language model tools it can choose to use. Think of it like handing someone a toolbox—they&#x27;ll grab a hammer when they need …</span>

                              <span>If there’s one thing I’ve learned as a programmer, it’s that failure isn’t just inevitable—it’s essential. In coding, mistakes, bugs, and errors aren’t signs of defeat but stepping stones to growth. Here’s why every programmer should embrace failure and see it as a powerful tool for improvement.
First, failure teaches you resilience. When your code doesn’t work, it’s easy to feel frustrated or discouraged. But pushing through those tough moments builds mental toughness and persistence, which are crucial skills not only in programming but in life.
Second, failure is a fantastic learning opportunity. Each bug or error challenges you to dig deeper and understand how things really work. You develop problem-solving skills by figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it, which sharpens your coding abilities.
Third, failure encourages experimentation and creativity. When you’re not afraid to make mistakes, you’re more likely to try new approaches, test out wild ideas, and innovate. Some of the best features and solutions come from taking risks and learning from what didn’t work.
Fourth, failure fosters humility and collaboration. It reminds us that we don’t know everything, which opens the door to asking for help, learning from others, and working better as a team.
Lastly, embracing failure helps you build confidence. Over time, you realize that mistakes don’t define you—they’re just part of the process. That mindset shift makes tackling bigger challenges less intimidating.
So if you’re struggling with bugs or feeling stuck, remember: failure is your friend. It’s proof that you’re pushing boundaries and growing as a coder. Embrace it, learn from it, and keep coding. What’s a failure that taught you something important? Share your story!</span>

Deniz kenarında güneşlenmek, yüzmek veya sadece manzaranın tadını çıkarmak, yaz tatilinin vazgeçilmez aktivitelerindendir. Bu yılki yaz tatilimden bazı anıları ve deneyimlerimi sizinle paylaşmak istiyorum.
Tatil planlarımı yaparken, her zamanki gibi her şeyin yolunda gitmesini istiyordum. Tatil deneyimimi etkileyebilecek herhangi bir sorun veya aksaklık yaşamak istemiyordum. Özellikle de son dakika sürprizleriyle uğraşmak zorunda kalmak istemezdim. Bu nedenle, tatilimden birkaç hafta önce, her şeyin planlandığı gibi gidebilmesi için tüm hazırlıklarımı tamamlamaya odaklandım.

As someone who loves both, some of my favorite experiences happen right at that intersection—when I’m creating a game or tweaking gameplay with lines of code. I wanted to share a few of those memorable moments that make game development so rewarding for me.
Bringing Ideas to Life
The Thrill of Debugging
Experimenting with Physics and Controls
Collaborating with Others
The Joy of Playtesting
Game development combines logic, creativity, and passion in a unique way, and these moments remind me why I keep coming back to it. If you’re a gamer or a coder—or both—what are some of your favorite game dev memories? I’d love to hear your stories!</span>
