                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. 

Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.

Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.

Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”
Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …</span>

The initiative places VanEck among a growing number of traditional finance firms entering the RWA tokenization space.
The fund, called VBILL, will be initially available on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum and Solana blockchains, VanEck said in a May 13 statement. The fund&#x27;s minimum subscriptions start at $100,000 for investments running on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Solana, while the minimum subscription on Ethereum is $1 million.

Bitcoin fails to capitalize on lower-than-expected US CPI data, seeing a Wall Street sell-off for a second day.

Traders see BTC/USD buying time before its next move, and a trip below $100,000 is on the cards.

Bitcoin is showing “undeniable” momentum against gold and stocks, Binance’s Richard Teng says.

Bitcoin (BTC) saw a repeat sell-off at the May 13 Wall Street open as bears ignored positive US inflation data.

In a May 13 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, Eric Council Jr.’s legal team asked that he be sentenced to no more than one year and one day in prison following his guilty plea. 
Council was part of a group that took control of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) X account in 2024 through a SIM swap attack, posting a message that suggested the regulator had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund listings for the first time.

TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …</span>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen.

Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically se…</span>

                              <span>Institutional demand for Bitcoin is growing, as Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, recorded its highest daily outflows of Bitcoin in 2025 on May 9.
On May 9, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

The outflow occurred as Bitcoin traded above $103,600 and just days after the White House announced a 90-day reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the US and China, easing market concerns and lifting broader investor sentiment.

Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.
Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“
Hu challenged the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital.

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

A falling wedge breakout projects 40% gains ahead, but $2.80 may act as interim resistance.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

Web3 and privacy-focused web browser Brave Browser has integrated the Cardano blockchain into its native and standalone wallets.
According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:
“Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”

According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analys…</span>

                              <span>Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko proposed a new data availability (DA) solution to improve persistent fragmentation and lack of interoperability across blockchain networks.
In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra during a May 12 press conference that Charlton would be the new assistant minister for science, technology and the digital economy, working with Tim Ayres, the minister for industry and innovation. 
Ayres and Charlton will administer policies and programs promoting advancements in emerging technologies, science, technology, innovation and the digital economy, according to Albanese.

Jenner had escaped a class-action lawsuit from buyers of her self-titled memecoin, Caitlyn Jenner (JENNER) after California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. said in a motion filed on May 9 that it was “sufficient to conclude that all nine causes of action are deficient” and sided with Jenner in dismissing the suit in its entirety for failure to state a claim.
He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original.

In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.

Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

Choosing the right front-end framework for your next web project isn’t just about trends—it&#x27;s about making decisions that will affect scalability, maintainability, and team productivity.
Here are 5 essential factors to consider before picking a front-end framework in 2025. ✅
Are you building a dynamic dashboard, a marketing site, or a full-blown SaaS app? Your project’s nature should guide your decision:
Enterprise-grade dashboard? Angular or React.
Quick MVP for a startup? Vue or Svelte.
SEO-heavy marketing site? Next.js (React) or Nuxt (Vue).
It&#x27;s critical to assess your team’s existing knowledge:
Familiar with JavaScript only? Try Vue or React.
Comfortable with TypeScript and larger tooling? Angular may be viable.…</span>

Today, I&#x27;m excited to introduce Filterable, a new open-source package that makes dynamic query filtering both powerful and simple with its modular, trait-based architecture.
We&#x27;ve all been there. Your controller starts simple, but as filtering requirements grow, it quickly becomes cluttered:

{

When deploying a Laravel 12 application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using PHP 8.4, many developers encounter composer-related issues, especially deprecation warnings. This guide aims to provide a clear solution to handle these deprecated messages effectively while setting up your application in the AWS environment.
Understanding the Problem
Composer is a dependency management tool commonly used in Laravel applications. If you&#x27;re getting depreciation warnings during deployment, it often indicates that the version of Composer included in your Elastic Beanstalk environment is outdated and doesn&#x27;t align with the newer PHP standards. By default, Elastic Beanstalk comes with a pre-installed version of Composer, which may not support the latest Laravel features. Hence, it&#x27;s crucial to o…</span>

In this article I explored how I add recurring events in Rails. Let&#x27;s now look at how to add a natural language parser input field. Instead of having users select from dropdown menus with Daily, Weekly, etc., I want users to type things like every week or monthly on the 15th.
Something like this:

(not pretty, but it work! 😄)
This feature is built on top of the work from the previous article. View the complete implementation in this commit.
First, let&#x27;s look at the view changes. Replace the previous basic select input, in app/views/events/_form.html.erb, with a text field:
- 
-   
-   &lt;%&#x3D; form.select :recurring_type, [

Today, we&#x27;re tackling something that&#x27;s top-of-mind for any serious application: performance, reliability, and scalability. How do we take these powerful new V5 features and ensure our conversational UIs are not just feature-rich, but also snappy, robust, and ready to handle real-world load?

In the realm of asynchronous programming with C++, the senders and receivers proposal (P2300) introduces new concepts that allow developers to manage operations and their outcomes in a more declarative manner. At the core of this proposal are various components, including completion signatures which help specify how values, errors, and stop signals are communicated. This article will break down the sender&#x27;s implementation alongside the definitions of __types&gt;, __types&gt;, and __types&gt;, clarifying their functionalities within the context of your shared code.

                              <span>Alright folks, let&#x27;s talk persistence. If you&#x27;ve been following along with the Vercel AI SDK v5 canary journey, you know we&#x27;ve covered a lot about the new message structures (UIMessage, UIMessagePart), how the client-side state is managed with useChat (especially with that id prop behaving like a mini ChatStore), and how the server-side flow including onFinish and tool calls works. Now, how do we actually save all this rich conversational data so users can come back to their chats?
This isn&#x27;t just about stashing some text in a database anymore. With V5, we&#x27;re dealing with structured, multi-part messages that are key to those &quot;generative UI&quot; experiences. Getting persistence right means your users get a pixel-perfect restore of their chat, tools and all, and you, the developer, get a system …</span>

                              <span>Alright folks, settle in. We&#x27;ve been exploring the Vercel AI SDK v5 canary in this series, and today we&#x27;re tackling a big one: Tools. If you&#x27;re building any kind of agentic behavior, or just need your AI to interact with the outside world (or your own app&#x27;s functions), this is where the rubber meets the road. v5 brings some serious structure and developer experience improvements to how tools are defined, called, and represented in the UI.
As a quick reminder, we&#x27;re building on concepts from previous posts: UIMessage and UIMessagePart (the new message anatomy), v5&#x27;s streaming capabilities, V2 Model Interfaces (especially LanguageModelV2FunctionTool), and the overall client/server architecture. If those are new to you, you might want to glance back.

                              <span>CSS can feel simple—until it&#x27;s not. In interviews for frontend roles, seasoned developers often face CSS questions that test deeper understanding of the cascade, specificity, layout behaviors, and browser quirks.
In this post, I’ve compiled 10 advanced and tricky CSS questions you&#x27;re likely to encounter, along with detailed answers and examples.
margin: auto center a div vertically?


Question:
.center {
  margin: auto;
  height: 100px;
}

Why doesn&#x27;t this vertically center it inside its parent?
Answer:
margin: auto works for vertical centering only if:
The parent has a defined height

The child is not using position: static or position: relative

The child has a fixed height



But most importantly, vertical margin: auto doesn’t work in normal flow—you need flex or grid for that.
Fix:
