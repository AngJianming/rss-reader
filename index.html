                              <span>Clean code isn&#x27;t always fast code. While abstractions like LINQ, interfaces, or dependency injection make our code cleaner and more maintainable, they can introduce runtime overhead. And in performance-critical paths, those costs add up quickly.
In this article, we&#x27;ll walk through how common .NET abstractions can degrade performance, explore when to use them with care, and share techniques to avoid unnecessary overhead.
LINQ is incredibly expressive, but it&#x27;s not always the most efficient — especially in tight loops or &quot;hot paths.&quot;

While flexible, LINQ&#x27;s deferred execution model can lead to hidden costs. The .ToList() call here forces immediate materialisation, introducing new allocations for the list and potentially temporary iterat…</span>

We evaluated several platforms (Shopify Plus, WooCommerce with B2B plugins, and Magento), but chose Shopaccino for three primary reasons:
Built-in B2B features like bulk pricing, GST management, and dealer-specific login.
Flexible category-level control and filtering that suited our product structure.
Localized support with experience in Indian commerce logistics.
The platform gave us the ability to scale from a small inventory to several thousand SKUs with product combinations across sizes, fabrics, and colors—without major dev overhead.
One of the trickiest parts of building the site was how to organize products by cut, fabric, and seasonal style. Our catalog isn’t just big—it’s complex. For instance, our Bottomwear collection includes ev…</span>

As a child, few games captured imagination like Prince of Persia. From precise jumps to daring sword fights and timed traps, it wasn’t just a game—it was an adventure. Today, we’ll walk through building a simple 2D platformer inspired by Prince of Persia using Python, Pygame, and Amazon Q CLI, all developed natively on Linux.
But this isn&#x27;t just about writing code. It’s about turning nostalgia into a working project using AI-assisted development.
When I was a kid, I used to watch my mother play games on her Nokia 310. The game “Snake” fascinated me.
How did it move? How did it know when to turn or end?
Back then, I didn’t have the answers. But today, I do—thanks to tools like Amazon Q CLI, which lets me build games by simply describing what I want to create.
Now, I’ve tak…</span>

                              <span>Welcome to the first post in the series: “Behind the Underscores”. This series is all about diving deep into one of Python’s most elegant and powerful features: special methods, also known as dunder methods. These aren’t just fancy syntax tricks, they’re the backbone of how Python objects behave and interact.
But before we get into specific methods like __init__ or __len__, we need to understand the big picture. What are special methods really? Why do they exist? And why are they so central to writing truly Pythonic code?
Let’s unpack it all.
Special methods are methods in Python that start and end with double underscores. You’ll see names like __str__, __call__, __getitem__, and so on. You might have heard them called:
Dunder methods (short for “double underscore”)

This status is a 16-bit integer returned by the kernel to describe how a child process changed state. It can represent:
Normal termination (via exit() or return)
Killed by a signal
Stopped by a signal
Continued (after being stopped)
Let&#x27;s read this from least significant bit (bit 0) to most (bit 15):
Normal Termination





Bits 0–7:    Always zero
Bits 8–15:   Exit status (0–255)

So the value looks like:
0x00SS  (where SS is the exit status byte)

Detected by WIFEXITED(status) macro.
WIFSIGNALED(status) → false







  
  
  ☠️ 2. Killed by Signal





Bits 0–6:   Signal number (non-zero)
Bit 7:      Core dump flag
Bits 8–15:  Unused (0)

Example: if the process was killed by SIGSEGV (11) and dumped core:
Signal &#x3D; 11  → bits 0-6 &#x3D; 0001011
Core   &#x3D; 1   → bit 7 &#x3D; 1

status &#x3D; 00000000 10001011  → 0x008B

WIFSIGNALED(status) checks that:
Bits 0–6 ≠ 0 (so signal present)
Bits 8–15 &#x3D; 0 (not a stopped or continued signal)
If so → returns true




Then:
WTERMSIG(status) → reads bits 0–6 → 11
WCOREDUMP(status) → reads bit 7
Stopped by Signal





Bits 0–7:   0x7F (decimal 127)
Bits 8–15: Stop signal

Looks like: 0xSS7F where SS &#x3D; signal
Detected by WIFSTOPPED(status)


WIFSIGNALED(status) → false







  
  
  ▶️ 4. Continued





status &#x3D; 0xFFFF

Used with waitpid(..., WCONTINUED)

Detected by WIFCONTINUED(status)


WIFSIGNALED(status) → false

The debate between dedicated server hosting and cloud hosting is at the forefront of IT decisions for 2025. Each option offers distinct advantages depending on your business model, scalability needs, budget, and security concerns.
Let’s break down both options so you can determine which solution best aligns with your business goals.

Dedicated server hosting gives a business full access to a physical server exclusively used by one client. That means no shared resources, more control, and higher performance.
This type of hosting is ideal for businesses requiring:
High traffic handling
Custom configurations
Enhanced security
Resource-intensive applications

Whether you are building dynamic websites, handling user interactions, or updating content without reloading the page, the DOM plays a central role. This article explores what the DOM is, how it relates to HTML and JavaScript, and how to effectively use JavaScript to interact with it.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface provided by the browser that allows scripts to access and manipulate the structure, style, and content of a web document. When a web page is loaded, the browser parses the HTML and constructs a corresponding DOM tree—a hierarchical representation of all elements on the page.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he and designer Jony Ive are developing these secret devices for mass consumption, with plans to ship 100 million units upon launch.
Ives joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21. 
Neither Altman nor Ives specified what these companion devices would look like or how they would operate. Ives simply referred to them as a “new design movement” that would be similar to Apple’s family of hardware and software integr…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

The products will be offered through Backed, a new Kraken partner, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph. Tokens representing the stocks will be stored on the Solana blockchain due to its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem,” the statement said.
“The whole point of crypto is that we&#x27;re able to see things very transparently,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said during Solana&#x27;s Accelerate event on May 22. ”It&#x27;s decentralized.

Despite concerns over the bond market, Bitcoin and stocks enjoy stability at the start of the Wall Street trading session.

BTC price expectations remain lofty amid low volatility and a curious lack of profit-taking.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.

                              <span>As the question of stablecoin regulation heats up in the US Senate, so has the issue of which members are personally invested in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency firms. 
On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

                              <span>Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.
Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

                              <span>What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. 
In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here&#x27;s some of our money. We&#x27;re putting it down. We&#x27;re showing that we&#x27;re serious about doing this.”

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

                              <span>The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

                              <span>Crypto awareness in Singapore has reached an all-time high, with 94% of respondents in a recent survey indicating familiarity with at least one digital asset.
However, ownership declined, falling to 29% in 2025 from 40% the previous year, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21.
The survey, conducted in February with 1,500 participants, revealed that men remain more active in crypto investing than women, 35% compared to 24%.
Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”
Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchav…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens.

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”
Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many.
Long-term analysis suggests that not only i…</span>

                              <span>What is shilling in crypto?            
            
                
At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

                              <span>The hacker behind the data breach targeting Coinbase users mocked blockchain investigator ZachXBT with an onchain message following a major crypto swap.
On May 21, the hacker used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” followed by a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar.
The message came after the attacker swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. 
ZachXBT flagged the message on his Telegram channel, linking it to the same entity responsible for the Coinbase data breach affecting at least 69,400 users.

Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure.
The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals. 
Microsoft says that Lumma has been sold via underground forums since 2022 and that it has undergone multiple upgrades since its launch.

                              <span>Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance has reportedly endorsed the creation of a dedicated body to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure in the country.
The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV.
Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry.
“With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.
