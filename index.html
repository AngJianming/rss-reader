                              <span>Franklin, a hybrid cash and crypto payroll provider, is launching a new initiative that aims to turn idle-sitting payroll into an opportunity for yield.
The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader&#x27;s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. 
Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet…</span>

At the time, the assets were worth roughly $492,000. At current market prices, the tokens are valued at more than $13 million.

The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements.

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

Bitcoin exchange volume delta becomes a key ingredient in assessing the staying power of BTC price breakouts, per analysis from CryptoQuant.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

Bitcoin dropped over 4.5% on May 19, confirming a bearish divergence and threatening a break below $100,000.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. 

A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 4.5% from its intraday high on May 19, falling to around $102,000 in its worst daily drop in over a month.

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

Metaplanet said on May 19 that it purchased 1,004 Bitcoin (BTC) for a total cost of around 15.2 billion yen ($104.6 million), bringing its total holdings to 7,800 Bitcoin worth around $807 million at current market prices.
It is the second-largest purchase the firm has made following its buy of 1,241 BTC for $129 million on May 12 in a move that pushed its Bitcoin holdings above that of El Salvador.

In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

The Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow approved a request from investigators to keep Smerkis in custody while he is being investigated, Russian state-owned news outlet TASS reported on May 18.
Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

                              <span>1. The Use Case: Your Cloud Mentor, On-Demand


Navigating the vast and sometimes complex world of AWS documentation and account management can be overwhelming—especially when you&#x27;ve reached your 50th browser tab. Imagine having a voice assistant that understands your questions, visually analyzes your AWS Console screen, quickly fetches documentation, and provides precise, context-aware answers—almost like a senior peer or mentor sitting right next to you. This is the vision that inspired me to build this tool.
My goal was straightforward yet ambitious: to build a cloud-powered, real-time, speech-to-speech assistant leveraging AWS&#x27;s powerful Nova models. The result? See the demo below for yourself:

                              <span>AI-powered code suggestions from tools like Cursor and Windsurf can introduce security flaws for several reasons. First, these models are built on extensive datasets that include publicly available code and third-party libraries, many of which already contain known weaknesses. 
As a result, the AI may inadvertently learn and replicate those insecure patterns. Additionally, these tools often produce predictable and repetitive code structures that, while syntactically correct, may be vulnerable to exploitation if not verified properly. 
Another key concern is their limited understanding of the broader application environment, including specific business logic or security policies, leading to code suggestions that may function correctly but pose risks when deployed. The fast-paced nature of A…</span>

Practice Management Software is a digital platform designed to support the non-clinical functions of a healthcare practice. It brings together essential administrative tasks such as appointment scheduling, patient registration, billing, insurance processing, and reporting—into one cohesive system.
This centralized approach eliminates redundancy, minimizes errors, and frees up valuable time so that providers and staff can focus more on patient care…</span>

I made this mistake this week of believing I wanted to automate, using an LLM of course, some parts of the painful podcast release cycle.
Weekly I record episodes of the podcast Adventures in DevOps with my awesome co-host. Of course all the episodes are available on our podcast website as well other streaming platforms.
But! Since we&#x27;re a technical podcast, we decided to make our infrastructure open source (On GitHub unfortunately), but to go further it also uses GitHub Actions to publish the episodes to our website. There is of course the nasty bit of actually recording the episodes, editing the episodes, and then downloading and formatting them to make them nice.
After that is all done though, it is time to create the episode page and most importantly …</span>

                              <span>In object-oriented Python, understanding the distinction between @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property is essential for building clean, maintainable, and extensible codebases. These are not interchangeable, they serve different semantic purposes and their appropriate use can significantly impact the clarity and flexibility of your class design.
This post explores each decorator in depth, with practical scenarios and implementation patterns that go beyond the basics.
@classmethod: Class-Aware Behavior


A @classmethod is a method that receives the class (cls) as its first argument, rather than an instance (self). This difference gives it access to the class object itself, including its attributes, methods, base classes, and even its dynamic type. This makes @classmethod ideal for use c…</span>

I&#x27;m a software engineer and I have been studying Japanese for about a year and a half. In my free time, I&#x27;ve made some tools to help me study. In this post, I want to talk about these tools.
First of all, I imagine that my audience is mainly Software Engineers and other people mainly interested in the technology aspect, and not many of you speak Japanese or are studying Japanese. So I need to explain a few basic things about the Japanese language that will help you understand the reasoning behind the code I wrote. I&#x27;m not a linguist, so I will just try to explain things to the limit of my knowledge.
Japanese has 3 writing systems, two of which (Hiragana and Katakana) are a syllabary, and one of which is pictographs (in particular, Chinese letters - Kanji). Each Kanji has a m…</span>

Have you ever encounter a massive React component that a team spends months to build happened to be awfully laggy? It seems that nobody can figure out it&#x27;s re-rendering so much and if one figure out, it would be too risky to re-write the logic.

Have you ever integrate a non-React library into React? Somehow your component just freeze because it was re-rendered again and again, and your React state not in sync with that outside library at all?

If I tell you to use another JS framework to solve those problem, you&#x27;d tell me, wouldn&#x27;t I have to throw away all my muscle memory and technical details I know about…</span>

We didn’t have a massive content library. Just a few product walkthroughs, some onboarding videos, and a couple of marketing clips embedded in the homepage. So I figured why bring in another service when I could control the whole thing myself?
It felt clean. Efficient. “Real engineer” stuff.
I set up the usual stack: S3 buckets for storage, FFmpeg for encoding, CloudFront as the CDN, and some Lambda functions to glue it all together. Simple enough. Plus, it meant:
I could fine-tune the encoding settings and generate only the resolutions we needed.
We avoided adding yet another vendor dependency in the stack.
Costs were minimal just bandwidth and storage.
It worked well enough for an MVP.
Back then, I believed owning the pipeline meant owning the qua…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

                              <span>Attorneys for Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the motion to dismiss the case due to the prosecution withholding exculpatory evidence in the form of communications with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) dating back to 2023.
According to a May 16 letter from Storm&#x27;s attorneys to Judge Katherine Polk Failla, the FinCEN documents show that non-custodial crypto mixers do not fall under the legal definition of a &quot;money transmitting business&quot; and that prosecutors have known this since at least 2023.
Despite having knowledge of the FinCEN guidance on crypto mixers, state prosecutors still proceeded with cases against the Samourai Wallet developers and Tornado Cash, the attorneys alleged.
