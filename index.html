                              <span>Cardone Capital, a real estate investment firm with over $5 billion in assets under management, launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund, a dual-asset fund consisting of a 346-unit multifamily commercial property located on the Miami River in Miami, Florida, and $15 million of Bitcoin (BTC).
In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm&#x27;s fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.
Cardone told Cointelegraph the impetus to start the fund followed a suggestion from his brother. The CEO said:

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt cri…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

&quot;I only buy Bitcoin with money I can&#x27;t afford to lose,&quot; Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company&#x27;s most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy&#x27;s total holdings to 576,230 BTC.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today&#x27;s tran…</span>

                              <span>AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

                              <span>The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.
Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid&#x27;s native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout—one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line at around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…</span>

“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

The fix? Stop shipping just your code. Ship the whole damn environment it needs to run. It’s like mailing someone a cake by sending them your entire kitchen instead of just the recipe and hoping they have a stand mixer.

Suddenly you&#x27;re staring at three different APIs, each with their own quirks, data formats, and authentication methods. PayU wants a hash, Stripe wants sessions, and don&#x27;t even get me started on their different ways of handling amounts (seriously, who decided some should use paise and others should use rupees?).
I recently found myself in this exact situation while working on a project, and instead of copy-pasting code like a barbarian, I decided to build something that wouldn&#x27;t make me want to throw my laptop out the window every time I needed to add a new gateway.

                              <span>Have you ever built a Power Automate flow that triggered more times than expected, burning through API limits or flooding your run history?
Trigger conditions in Power Automate are an underrated yet powerful way to ensure your flows only run when absolutely necessary — even before the first action is executed.
Trigger conditions are logical expressions that evaluate the incoming trigger data before the flow starts. If the condition evaluates to true, the flow runs. If not, it’s silently skipped.
That means:
No wasted API calls

No unnecessary flow runs

No bloated run history
Perfect for enterprise-scale environments, where performance and governance matter.
Let’s say you have a flow that runs when a Case record is updated in Dynamics 365, but you only want to act if the status changes to …</span>

                              <span>Road Runner – A Python Game Built with Amazon Q CLI
In just under an hour, I built a Python game called &quot;Road Runner&quot; with the help of Amazon Q CLI and the PyGame library.
Game Overview
&quot;Road Runner&quot; is a fast-paced arcade-style game where you dodge oncoming traffic by switching lanes and try to survive as long as possible.
Game Features
Scrolling road and lane dividers
Red player car controlled with arrow keys
Random obstacles like cars and bikes
Collision detection and score system
Game over and restart flow
Increasing difficulty as you progress
How Amazon Q CLI Helped
Amazon Q CLI was instrumental in speeding up the process. I could just describe what I wanted, and it helped generate the necessary code, including:
Game loop structure
Classes for the player, background, and obstacles
Movement and collision logic
Visual polish like headlights and taillights
Final Thoughts
I didn’t expect to build a full game so quickly, but Amazon Q CLI made it feel effortless. It handled the boilerplate, while I focused on making the gameplay feel smooth and engaging.</span>

Te tengo buenas noticias: VPC es exactamente como planificar y construir tu propia ciudad. Y una vez que entiendas esta analogía, nunca más volverás a confundirte con la arquitectura de redes en la nube.
Imagina que AWS te da un terreno en blanco y te dice: &quot;Aquí puedes construir tu ciudad digital&quot;. 
Tu VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) es ese territorio que defines, donde tienes control total sobre:
Cómo divides el espacio
Quién puede entrar y salir
Cómo se conectan las diferentes áreas
Qué nivel de seguridad tiene cada zona
En términos técnicos, defines un &quot;bloque CIDR&quot; - pero piénsalo simplemente como las coordenadas geográficas de tu ciudad.

you’ve just set up your MongoDB replica set, wired up Mongoose, and you call your neatly encapsulated create() method… but your database ends up with two documents instead of one.
You know you only called it once—your logs even say so—but Mongoose is confidently firing two insert commands:
Mongoose: tags.insertOne({ name: &#x27;frontend&#x27;, …, _id: X }, {})
Mongoose: tags.insertOne({             …, _id: Y }, {})

What gives? Let’s walk through the two small twists that cause this, and how to fix them.
By default, Mongoose’s Model.create() signature is:
Model.create(
  doc1: any,
  doc2?: any,    // another document
  /* … */
  callback?: fn,
)

There is no “options” argument here. When you write:
tagModel.create(
  { name, color, user, parent },
  { session }
)

Estou falando do defer, panic e o recover. Go tem uma maneira bem peculiar (e poderosa) de lidar com exceções, diferente do tradicional try/catch/finally
defer


Agenda uma função para ser executada no fim da função atual.
Se temos uma instrução defer no escopo de uma função, ela será adiada até que a função termine, seja normalmente, com return ou mesmo em caso de panic.
Para ficar mais claro, veremos alguns exemplos
O defer é chamado no final da função
func main() {
    defer fmt.Println(&quot;defer executado&quot;)
    fmt.Println(&quot;fim da função&quot;)
}
// Saída:
// fim da função
// defer executado

return explícito


Mesmo que você use return no meio da função, o defer que foi adiado (deferred) ainda se…</span>

Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is a crucial aspect of modern JavaScript engines, significantly affecting performance, behavior, and execution efficiency. This article delves deep into JIT compilation, exploring its historical evolution, inner workings, practical implications on JavaScript code, performance considerations, debuggability, and real-world applications, aiming to provide senior developers with an exhaustive reference on the topic.
JavaScript&#x27;s origins trace back to Brendan Eich&#x27;s creation in 1995, which initially lacked the sophistication of today’s development environments. Early JavaScript engines, such as Netscape’s SpiderMonkey, relied on interpreters that executed bytecode from JavaScript scripts. As the necessit…</span>

TL;DR: Don&#x27;t mix data access concerns with essential business behavior.
Tight Coupling

Mixed responsibilities
Bijection violation
Testability
Business logic pollution

Separation of concerns violation
Blurred Layers
Single Responsibility Principle violation
Use dependency injection
Don&#x27;t use the Repository Pattern. Find real abstractions instead
Separate business logic

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Canada, Mong said that small businesses including bars, restaurants, convenience stores, and other local operators can generate revenue by hosting wireless hotspots and expanding network coverage.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn&#x27;t just power — it&#x27;s a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra&#x27;s OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …</span>

But this attainment is not about one company alone. 
“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&amp;P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph.

                              <span>Well-known Hyperliquid trader James Wynn has increased his 40x leverage long Bitcoin bet to $1.25 billion after closing his $PEPE position for a $25.2 million profit.
On May 24, Lookonchain reported that Wynn entered an 11,588 BTC position with an average entry price of $108,243 and a liquidation level of $105,180.
The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for…</span>

                              <span>President Donald Trump is facing scrutiny after speaking at a private event for top investors in his $TRUMP memecoin while standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the official presidential seal — a move that may violate federal law.
The event took place Thursday at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, where Trump addressed 220 investors in his cryptocurrency project.
According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.
Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.

“Bitcoin Treasury Companies will hold 50% of all BTC, way more than most Bitcoiners are prepared for,” Jesse Myers said in a May 23 X thread.
Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers
Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker.

On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.
Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collatera…</span>

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.

Semler Scientific’s shares have fallen 1.36% on the same day as the disclosure, though the decrease in its share price is largely in line with the Nasdaq’s performance. That index, which follows top tech stocks, is down 1% on the day.

In its Q1 2025 earnings report released on May 13, the company revealed a 44% drop in revenue year-over-year. Despite the claimed success of its Bitcoin treasury plan, Semler Scientific’s shares have dropped 18% in 2025, according to Google Finance.
Bitcoin treasury companies, or companies that traditionally sell equity or issue debt to buy BTC, had been drawing the interest of investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin price fluctuations.
Michael Saylor&#x27;s Strategy debuted its BTC reserve in August 2020, when it started purchasing Bitcoin. Bitcoin is up 181.6% year to date, while Semler Scientific shares rose 53% since announcing the BTC approach in May 2024.
