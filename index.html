                              <span>As artificial intelligence chatbots have become ever more conversational, so too have their apologies. Polite, effusive, and sometimes all too swift, these regretful proclamations spill forth whenever an AI misinterprets a question, oversteps a boundary, or simply fails to please. But beneath their digital charm, a troubling question grows: when chatbots constantly apologise—with no true understanding of guilt or intent—are they learning merely to please, or are they being unwittingly trained in the art of deception? In the urgent race to make machines seem more “human,” are we accidentally teaching them to fake remorse, and if so, who does that ultimately serve?
The apologetic AI is ubiquitous. Type even the mildest error-prone phrase into a chatbot, and you’ll likely be met with some var…</span>

Trending on Hugging Face, LTX-Video by Lightricks, is the first-of-its-kind video generation model built on the DiT (Denoising Diffusion Transformer) architecture. What sets LTX apart is its ability to generate stunning 30 FPS videos at a 1216×704 resolution in real-time, meaning it can render videos faster than you can watch them. From animating a scene from a simple text prompt to bringing a static image to life with an accompanying narrative, LTX handles both text-to-video and image-text-to-video generation with impressive quality and speed. Trained on a massive and diverse video dataset, it delivers not only high fidelity but also rich content diversity, making each output feel authentic an…</span>

                              <span>When I first started working on healthcare applications, one of the trickiest aspects was figuring out user permissions. Hospitals are loaded with sensitive data, and ensuring the right people can access the right information—without opening the floodgates—is a serious balancing act.
That’s where Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) really shines. It’s a flexible, scalable system for defining exactly who can do what inside your hospital management software. If you&#x27;re building a system that handles medical data, scheduling, or billing, this article will walk you through integrating RBAC the right way.
RBAC is all about assigning permissions based on user roles instead of individual accounts. So instead of micromanaging every user&#x27;s access, you simply define roles like “Doctor,” “Nurse,” or “Pat…</span>

                              <span>When developing Flutter applications, it&#x27;s common to encounter scenarios where text needs to wrap properly within certain widgets. In this article, we will explore how to effectively wrap text in a Draggable widget in Flutter, ensuring that the text does not overflow but instead adjusts dynamically as it grows. This problem is often faced when using the Text widget within draggable areas. Here, we will dissect the example you&#x27;ve provided and offer a solution that addresses the issue.
Understanding the Problem
When your Text widget displays long text, it might overflow off the screen if it doesn&#x27;t have proper constraints to wrap the text within its boundaries. The root of the problem often lies in the usage of the Text widget and how it is positioned within the Draggable component. You also…</span>

Building a content management system is an exciting journey, and today we&#x27;re diving into its core functionality - post creation. In this comprehensive guide, we&#x27;ll walk through implementing a robust post management system from the ground up. We&#x27;ll start by establishing a solid backend foundation with Node.js, setting up the necessary routes, models, and controllers. Then, we&#x27;ll move forward to create an intuitive frontend interface that integrates with our API.
This approach - beginning with the backend and then progressing to the frontend - will help us understand the complete data flow and ensure a well-structured application architecture. So let&#x27;s start from building the typical &quot;post schema&quot;, probably while developin…</span>

                              <span>In computer programming, tracing garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management that consists of determining which objects should be deallocated (&quot;garbage collected&quot;) by tracing which objects are reachable by a chain of references from certain &quot;root&quot; objects, and considering the rest as &quot;garbage&quot; and collecting them. Tracing is the most common type of garbage collection – so much so that &quot;garbage collection&quot; often refers to the tracing method, rather than others such as reference counting – and there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation. 
Tracing collectors are so called because they trace through the working set of memory. These garbage collectors perform collection in cycles. It is common for cycles to be triggered when there is not enough free memory for …</span>

                              <span>The badge isn’t the point—practice is.
Over the past three years I earned every AWS certification.

My certification triathlon study loop was simple:
Watch one AWS Black Belt video on the target domain

Drill through domain-specific question sets

Review every miss (and every hit) the next morning



That tight loop carried me across the finish line for every exam.
I think the answer is yes—at least for your first rep.
Buy a car, and suddenly you see the same model everywhere. 
Certifications work the same way: once my head was packed with VPC quirks and Lambda limits, blog posts, conference talks, and even hallway chats lit up with “Hey, I know this!” moments.

That learning tuned my attention, and it wasn’t limited to AWS services; even general foundational computer-science concepts started jumping out at me.
A skill sticks after three meaningful reps, even if the first one happens on paper.

Because AWS exams don’t include a hands-on lab, Rep #1 takes place in the multiple-choice arena: you architect in your head, choose an answer, and a wrong pick costs nothing but a red X.  
Badge in hand, I volunteered for two bite-sized projects—Rep #2 and Rep #3—where whiteboard sketches became CloudFormation stacks and IAM policies. That’s when theory clicked into muscle memory.
Certs don’t replace experience; they accelerate it.

The exam delivers a low-risk Rep #1, and the New-Car Effect immediately tunes your radar—you start noticing tickets, hallway questions, and side projects that echo the blueprint you just drilled. Grab those chances: Rep #2 and Rep #3 will show up almost automatically, and the badge will turn into working muscle faster than any other route.</span>

Have you ever wanted to build your own backend API but felt overwhelmed by terms like GraphQL, resolvers, and databases? Good news — you’re in the right place!
Traditional REST APIs can become bulky with multiple endpoints and overfetching data. GraphQL solves this by providing a single flexible endpoint where clients can ask for exactly what they need, making APIs more efficient and developer-friendly. Companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Facebook use GraphQL in production for this very reason.
Learning GraphQL and Prisma together is a superpower for modern developers. Many real-world applications — from simple todo apps to complex booking systems — rely on APIs to manage and share data.

                              <span>As businesses continue shifting their operations to the cloud, protecting sensitive data has become more challenging than ever. Traditional security methods fall short when it comes to safeguarding data during active processing. This is where Confidential Computing comes into play, offering a powerful solution to secure data even while it’s being used.
Confidential Computing is an advanced security approach that shields sensitive data during processing by isolating it within a secure section of a computer’s CPU, known as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). This ensures that neither malicious insiders nor even the cloud provider itself can access the data or the computations being performed.
Typically, when data is processed, it must be decrypted in memory, leaving it vulnerable to attac…</span>

This article introduces you to an industry standard of providing context to LLMs and agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP). 
By default, without giving LLMs and AI chatbots a proper context, they cannot fetch real-time information, execute code, call external tools and APIs, or even use a web browser on behalf of users. Developers can utilize the following approaches to fix this limitation of LLMs and agents.

The SEC pushed its decision on listing Grayscale’s spot Solana (SOL) Trust ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to October 2025, according to a May 13 filing by the securities regulator.

“Gold is getting very popular,” Amy Lo, the Swiss bank’s co-head of wealth management for Asia, said during Bloomberg’s New Voices event held in Hong Kong on May 13.
She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.

Bitcoin miners have stopped selling their BTC in what may signal the end of a lengthy distribution streak.

Over the past month, miner wallet balances have increased by around 2,700 BTC.

Hash Ribbons data shows good times continuing for both miners and BTC price strength.

Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation by miners is back as network participants swap selling for hodling at $75,000 lows.
Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that miners are now actively adding to their BTC reserves.

“Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.”
McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. 
But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.

                              <span>Crypto venture capital deals in the first quarter of 2025 saw deal values jump even as the number of deals sank from the same quarter a year ago, says PitchBook.
The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.
However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.
PitchBook&#x27;s senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.
This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, Ge…</span>

Former Cred CEO Daniel Schatt and chief financial officer Joseph Podulka admitted to wire fraud as part of a plea deal with prosecutors, according to a May 13 text filing in a California District Court.
District Judge William Alsup accepted the plea deals and set a sentencing hearing for Aug. 26. Wire fraud can carry up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for individuals and $500,00 for businesses.

The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.

The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.

The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin price holds above $100,000, driven by &quot;risk-on&quot; sentiment after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to 20. 

The Bitcoin Bull Score Index surged to 80, and the Fear &amp; Greed Index suggests growing optimism, with historical patterns indicating potential for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) price continues to consolidate higher above $100,000 after the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped to its 30-year average of 20, down from a peak of 60 earlier in 2025. This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.

In a May 12 letter, Senators Cynthia Lummis and Bernie Moreno suggested Bessent had the authority to change the definition of “adjusted financial statement income” under existing US law in a way that could reduce what digital asset companies pay in taxes. The proposed adjustment was suggested as a way to modify a provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law in 2022.
“Our edge in digital finance is at risk if US companies are taxed more than foreign competitors,” said Lummis in a May 13 X post.

“It’s really important that we have a stablecoin for Canadians,” Matheson told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview on May 13, adding that stablecoins are especially urgent because the country has “no peer-to-peer [payment] rail” and “wire transfers cost $45 and take 45 minutes of paperwork.”

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Solana&#x27;s $10.9 billion TVL surpassed the entire Ethereum layer-2 ecosystem.

Solana’s 30-day fee revenue ($43.4 million) rose 109% compared to the previous month.

SOL’s 8% funding rate shows healthy leverage demand from bulls.

Solana’s native token SOL (SOL) surged 24.8% between May 6 and May 10, following the broader altcoin market rally after Bitcoin broke above $100,000. Since then, SOL has struggled to stay above $180, but derivatives and onchain data still suggest further gains are in store.

While Solana ranks the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Solana Network is the vice-leader in key onchain metrics including the total value locked (TVL).

                              <span>Proponents of a bill to regulate stablecoins in the US Congress will likely take up another vote on the legislation in a matter of days without responding to concerns about President Donald Trump’s financial ties to the cryptocurrency industry.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, failed to get enough votes to pass in the US Senate on May 8 amid calls from some Democratic lawmakers to halt any legislation related to digital assets until Republicans could address Trump’s potential conflicts of interest. 
Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.
After the GENIUS Act failed to proceed in a 48 to 49 vote in the…</span>

Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. 

Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.

Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.

Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”
Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Declining Bitcoin dominance and rising strength in altcoins and memecoins could be a sign that it’s altseason.

USDT dominance could drop to 2022 lows, indicating an accelerating capital rotation into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

The cryptocurrency market shows signs that an altseason, a period where altcoins significantly outperform Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the horizon. Technical charts and market sentiment align to suggest that May 2025 might start a broader altcoin rally, driven by key indicators and shifting capital flows.
The TOTAL2 chart, representing the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, has broken above a downtrend line in place since January 2025. This breakout is accompanied by a bullish break of structure (BOS) on …</span>

The initiative places VanEck among a growing number of traditional finance firms entering the RWA tokenization space.
The fund, called VBILL, will be initially available on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum and Solana blockchains, VanEck said in a May 13 statement. The fund&#x27;s minimum subscriptions start at $100,000 for investments running on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Solana, while the minimum subscription on Ethereum is $1 million.
