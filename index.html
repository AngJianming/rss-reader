In this post, I will explain the basic setup of the SafeLine WAF free edition on a Synology NAS.
I am assuming that you already have some general knowledge on how to install a docker stack on a Synology NAS, otherwise I can highly recommend to visit mariushosting.com, where Marius wrote some very helpful guides on how to use the container manager and also Portainer etc..
Furthermore, the automatic certificate creation in SafeLine WAF, requires port 80 to be free on the NAS. Make sure that the port is not used by any other application, otherwise certificate generation will fail with the error that port 80 is already in use.
The first step is to create a folder in the lo…</span>

                              <span>AI has been getting a lot of attention lately—and yeah, some of the buzz is overhyped, but there’s also something real going on.
From my own experience as an engineering manager, I’ve seen how AI can free up time, speed up prototyping, and help devs focus more on what they actually enjoy doing—solving problems, shipping great products, learning new stuff.
I get that some people are worried AI will take their jobs. Honestly, I don’t think that’s the right question. It’s less about “Will AI replace me?” and more about “How can I use AI to level up and stay ahead?”
Here are five ways I’ve seen AI help software engineers do just that.

First, we need to create a R2 bucket where we&#x27;ll store the Docker images. We also need an API access key and secret key to access the bucket.
Once we have created the bucket and have both keys, we create a secret.
vi registry-secrets.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: r2-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  ACCESS_KEY_ID: 
  ACCESS_SECRET_KEY: 

And we apply the configuration.
kubectl apply -f registry-secrets.yaml

Once we&#x27;ve applied the secrets, we create the Registry deployment.

tl;dr - a story is told about how the author tests a module against a third-party web API when that service is not always available and without leaking sensitive authentication tokens
You find yourself to be an aspiring CPAN author of a web API and as a righteous follower of Test Driven Development you want to write tests to verify that your API works as advertised. Testing is a big part of Perl culture, so a skeleton module usually comes with a t/ directory to hold your tests.
Once uploaded to CPAN, the CPAN Testing Service will run your tests on every OS and version of Perl possible, but you shouldn&#x27;t require an active network connection on either end. After all, has your API failed because the end service is down for annual maintenance or the local interne…</span>

When integrating Google OAuth for authentication in your application, you might encounter various errors. One common issue is the ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent, especially if your code works perfectly on Android but fails on iPhone. This error message usually indicates that Google is rejecting the request due to the user agent string that your app is sending. Let&#x27;s explore why this happens and how to fix it.
Understanding the Issue
The ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent typically occurs when Google’s servers identify an untrusted or unsupported user agent accessing their OAuth service.

                              <span>As a softwar developer, choosing the right language and tools can make a huge difference in how efficiently you build, maintain, and scale applications. While Node.js is widely adopted in the backend world, I personally prefer Go (Golang) for several key reasons. Here&#x27;s why.
Go is a compiled language with built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels.
Whether it&#x27;s handling multiple HTTP requests or processing data-heavy tasks, Go offers consistent and high performance with minimal memory overhead. Its lightweight concurrency model is often simpler and more efficient than JavaScript’s event loop and async/await system.
Go is statically typed, which helps catch errors early during compilation.
In my experience, this leads to more robust code and reduces the kind of silent …</span>

                              <span>How We Built Delta Executor: Mobile-First Roblox Script Execution


Roblox&#x27;s scripting ecosystem has exploded in recent years — and so has the need for tools that empower developers to understand, test, and interact with Lua-based environments. At DeltaDevs, we created Delta Executor, a performance-first, cross-platform executor tailored for Roblox scripts on Android and iOS.
Many tools in the Roblox ecosystem are outdated, unsupported, or overly complex for mobile users. Delta Executor solves that with:
Script execution that’s stable across devices
A secure framework with memory-safe design
Keyless access for paid users (and fair key-based access for free users)
Smooth compatibility across Android, iOS, and emulators for PC
We built it from the ground up to handle the latest anti-cheat systems Roblox introduced in 2025. Here’s how we bypassed them.
-- Delta Executor Example
print(&quot;Hello from Delta Executor on Mobile!&quot;)

You can load, run, and debug scripts just like this on mobile devices using our tool. Full support for popular script libraries and obfuscation is built in.
While built for mobile-first use, Delta Executor also runs on Windows using emulators like BlueStacks or LDPlayer.
Want to see how it works? Visit our Executor Overview Page.
We&#x27;re also opening up SDK access for vetted contributors and curious reverse engineers.

We built Delta Executor with security transparency at the core. If you&#x27;ve seen antivirus warnings, you&#x27;re not alone — many executors trigger false positives. Here&#x27;s why.

Delta Executor is more than an exploit tool — it’s a research sandbox for scripters, hobbyists, and curious minds working within the Roblox engine. We hope this adds value to others building tools around Lua, mobile execution environments, and anti-cheat resistance.

                              <span>In tech, we’re wired for growth—more velocity, more releases, more impact, more headcount.
But lately, I’ve been asking myself: Where does it stop?
I’ve led high-performing teams, shipped at scale, climbed the ladder. But with each new role, I noticed a pattern—what looked like “success” on paper often came with hidden trade-offs: less time with family, more stress, fewer pauses to reflect.
We’re told to aim for the next title, the bigger compensation package, the unicorn IPO—as if each step up will quiet the internal noise. But it doesn’t.
Even at the top, many feel like they’re still chasing something just out of reach.
And here’s the kicker: when wealth and power concentrate, whether in tech or society, others get squeezed. I’ve seen brilliant engineers burn out, not because they weren’t good enough—but because the system kept telling them they had to want more.
But what if the real clarity doesn’t come from achieving more—but from needing less?
Less chaos.
I’ve found meaning in simpler things—mentoring a junior dev, walking outside between meetings, unplugging for dinner with my kids. These aren’t productivity hacks. They’re sanity savers.
Because underneath the frameworks and sprint goals, we’re just part of something bigger—organic, changing, deeply human.
The atoms in our bodies? They were once stars. Literally.
We are nature. And like nature, we’re not meant to scale infinitely.
So here’s a quiet question I’m sitting with—and maybe you should, too:
🔍 Is your pursuit of “more” giving you peace—or quietly taking it away?</span>

This document outlines a workflow for automating the publishing of Markdown articles to Dev.to using Node.js scripts and GitHub Actions. The actual implementation (such as scripts and configuration files) can be generated by AI or created by a developer, making this guide suitable for both human and AI readers.
This workflow is designed based on the fact that Dev.to is built on the Forem platform. Forem provides a public API (see: https://developers.forem.com/api/v1) that enables programmatic interaction with Dev.to, including publishing articles, retrieving user data, and more.
For this workflow, the AI assistant (not the user) has read and understood the Forem API documentation. The automation pro…</span>

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …</span>

                              <span>Despite the $1.4 billion lost in the recent Bybit hack, crypto companies have not changed their approach to cybersecurity, according to Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin. 
In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen 16 days of inflows for the spot BTC ETF, with a further 280 Bitcoin (BTC) or around $36 million piling into the fund on May 6, according to HODL15Capital.  
The inflow streak was noted by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, who also observed on X that the fund was approaching $5 billion in new capital. 
“I remember when naysayers didn’t think spot Bitcoin ETFs would take in $5 billion in total last year,” he added. 
“IBIT alone has done this in a few weeks, more than a year after launch.”
The BlackRock fund (IBIT) has seen around $4.7 billion in inflows since its last outflow day on Apri…</span>

Lee announced his crypto promises on May 6 as part of a broader initiative to provide more investment opportunities for Korea’s youth, one of the main target demographics for the fast-approaching June 3 election.
“I will create a safe investment environment so that young people can [build] assets and plan for the future,” The Korea Economic Daily (KED) quoted Lee as saying in Korean.
He also promised the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, lower transaction fees, and more consumer protection measures.

With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

                              <span>Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. 
The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

Democrats aim at Trump’s crypto profits with a 3-prong pincer move
US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.   
The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL) failed to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching $156 on April 25, but an assortment of data points suggests that the altcoin’s upside is not over.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.
“The Live Free or Die state is leading the way in forging the future of commerce and digital assets,” said New Hampshire Republicans in a May 6 X post.

The asset manager sees BNB’s price rising to approximately $1,275 per token by the end of 2025 and as high as $2,775 by the end of 2028, according to the research report. 
As of May 6, BNB trades at nearly $600 per coin, for a fully diluted value (FDV) of approximately $84 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. 
The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum&#x27;s rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum&#x27;s real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …</span>
