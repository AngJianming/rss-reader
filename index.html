                              <span>Yesterday, when I was at the bakery buying some snacks, I overheard a conversation between one attendant with another regarding her Android phone not downloading and installing the ChatGPT app. Curious about the subject, I decided to ask her more regarding her issue, and to talk about it. She explained her smartphone was an older model, using Android 8.0, aka Oreo, and that&#x27;s probably why the chatgpt android app wasn&#x27;t downloading and installing on it.
We talked a while, and I pondered that while there are a lot of reasons for an app not to work on an older Android OS version, the most relevant of them are the security reasons. So I decided to list eight changes from Android 8.0 (Oreo) to Android 15 (Vanilla Ice Cream), the most impactful and relevant of each major version:

                              <span>Hello, everybody! At Info-Polus, we see the opportunities RWA tokenization presents. Today, let&#x27;s dive into it!
The crypto bull market is not only driving up the large, established cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Memecoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe, and Shiba Inu, which have a lower market capitalization and are particularly volatile, have recently attracted great attention with impressive price rallies. 
By contrast, the increases in real world assets (RWA) have attracted less public attention - although many experts believe this crypto segment has excellent prospects…
So what lies in RWA?
As the name itself suggests, Real World Assets represent tangible and other assets existing in the “real world” (real estate, exchange-traded commodities, art objects) tokenized for use in the DeFi segment. The growing interest in tokenizing real-world assets stems from the promise of greater transparency, security, and global market reach. 
Let the numbers speak for themselves: the DeFi industry has boomed over the past few years, peaking at $181.22 billion in total value locked (TVL) on December 2, 2021. According to DefiLlama, RWA is steadily carving out its space in this ecosystem, with a TVL exceeding $8 billion in January 2025.

                              <span>Ever walked into a clothing store and wished a smart system could just tell you what to wear based on your style, the occasion, and where to find it in the store? That was the idea that sparked this project. I wanted to explore how such a kiosk system might work — not only recommending clothing based on user queries but also guiding the customer to the shelf where it’s located.
This document outlines the thought process and approach I followed while building this project. It covers the initial vision, the key problems I aimed to solve, the technologies I chose, and how I systematically broke the system down into modular components for development. It also includes the architectural decisions, design iterations, and how each part fits into the final integrated solution. It is an exploration…</span>

                              <span>TL;DR Of course, I realize that most major websites today are written in them, I&#x27;m just offering an alternative.
Hello everyone! Today, so many sites use frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js and others that you can&#x27;t help but think that this is hopelessness, but it&#x27;s not!
In this article, we will look at the main methods that you can use to create your web applications.
Let&#x27;s get started!
Yes, probably the most trivial solution that comes to mind is to create just components, but without frameworks. Although it is trivial, it is quite effective.
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML &#x3D; &#x60;Hello World&#x60;;
  }
}
customElements.define(&#x27;my-component&#x27;, MyComponent);

In native javascript, of course, there have long been solutions such as the …</span>

                              <span>During my industrial training, I had the opportunity to explore Lean Manufacturing, a system designed to make production more efficient by eliminating waste and focusing on value creation. I learned about important tools like 5S, which stands for Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. This method helps keep workspaces clean and organized, which is essential for safety and productivity.
Another key concept I studied was Kaizen, which means continuous improvement. It emphasizes that small daily changes can lead to significant improvements over time. I also gained practical experience with Just-in-Time inventory management, which ensures materials arrive exactly when needed, reducing storage costs and avoiding overproduction.
This training helped me connect the theoretical concepts learned in class with real-world production challenges. I realized that efficiency is not only about speed but also about smart use of resources and people. I saw how teamwork and communication play a vital role on the factory floor. Lean Manufacturing is not just a set of techniques; it is a culture of continuous problem solving and improvement. As an Industrial and Production Engineering graduate, I believe this mindset will guide me in all my future professional endeavors.</span>

One minute he&#x27;s a fearsome predator stalking invisible prey, the next he&#x27;s a professional napper who can sleep 18 hours straight. In the JavaScript world, he&#x27;d need multiple inheritance to truly capture his essence - but as we know, JavaScript only supports single inheritance. 
Enter mixins - the perfect solution for when your objects need to be as multi-talented as my cat!
In JavaScript, mixins are a pattern that allows us to add methods and properties from one object to another without inheritance. Think of them as behavior packages that you can &quot;mix in&quot; to any object or class.
It&#x27;s like how Oreo can be both a &quot;Cat&quot; (base class) but also mix in behaviors like &quot;NapMaster&quot;, and &quot;ZoomiesPractitioner&quot; without needing to inherit from mul…</span>

Portuguese version: Documentação de componentes em React com Typescript usando Storybook (versão 8)
Previously, I wrote an article about components documentation using storybook when the version was below 8. Due to some changes introduced in version 8 and my deeper understanding of the library, I’m now writing an updated version in this article.
setup: storybook configuration
stories: definition of the main scenarios for the components to be documented
mdx: documentation of the components, incorporating the customizations defined in the stories
example: an example of component documentation will be presented
Each component will have its own mdx and stories file.
To add storybook to a React application with the initial configurations, you need to run the following command in …</span>

English version: Documentation of components in React with TypeScript using Storybook (version 8)
Anteriormente escrevi em um artigo sobre a documentação de componentes usando storybook, quando a versão estava abaixo da 8. Devido a algumas mudanças que vieram com essa versão e ter me aprofundado mais com a lib, estou escrevendo uma versão atualizada nesse artigo.
setup: configuração do storybook
stories: definição dos principais cenários dos componentes a serem documentados
mdx: documentação dos componentes, trazendo as customizações definidas nos stories
exemplo: vai ser apresentado um exemplo de documentação de um componente
Cada componente terá seu próprio arquivo mdx e de stories.

Filecoin and Lockheed Martin adapted the system for use in space and successfully tested it, Belcher said during the Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto.
The IPFS enhances privacy and security compared to traditional web protocols, such as HTTP, by identifying data based on its content rather than its location. This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.

According to a May 16 Bloomberg report, Sequoia Capital Managing Partner Roelof Botha’s personal information available through his Coinbase account was stolen after a group of cybercriminals bribed the exchange’s support agents for access to user data. Though Botha had not publicly disclosed his net worth, estimates suggested he had hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a May 15 blog post, saying that some of its users had been targeted with social engineering attacks after the criminals had access to their personal account information. The comp…</span>

On May 16, the protocol unveiled SolvBTC.AVAX, a token that connects Bitcoin (BTC) to real-world assets like US Treasurys and private credit offered by BlackRock and Hamilton Lane. 
The new token was developed through a seven-way partnership involving Solv, Avalanche, Balancer, Elixir, Euler, Re7 Labs, and LFJ, the company said. 
Solv Protocol founder Ryan Chow said the token is a way to link Bitcoin to “real-world economic cycles” in uncorrelated assets such as US government bonds and private credit, as opposed to BTC’s typical boom-and-bust four-year cycle.

The altcoin market cap, excluding Ether (ETH), has added $126 billion in Q2, sparking enthusiasm from analysts who have been waiting for an altseason. Crypto analyst Javon Marks noted a breakout that could rival the explosive 2017 bull run. 
In a recent post on X, Marks highlighted a chart comparing the TOTAL3 index (total market cap of altcoins excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum) against the US money supply, suggesting that altcoins may be on the verge of a significant rally.

$6.8 billion in long positions far outweight the current $25 million in shorts.

Bitcoin options positioning and spot BTC inflows point to confidence from institutional investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) price climbed 23.7% over the past 30 days, yet traders on Bitfinex have cut their leveraged long positions by more than 18,000 BTC during this time. This wave of profit-taking in margin markets has led to speculation that professional traders may not be fully confident in the current $104,000 price level.

On May 16, Singapore-based Basel said it was “in advanced discussions with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals […] to acquire a US$1 billion BTC through an innovative share-swap arrangement.
The company said the benefits of its planned purchase include creating “one of the strongest balance sheets among Asia-focused healthcare providers” and providing “unmatched financial flexibility for mergers and acquisitions.”
It also said the Bitcoin (BTC) treasury would help Basel “[e]stablish “a diversified asset base to weather market volatility.”

                              <span>Key points:

A Bitcoin price close above $105,000 could accelerate momentum and trigger a rally to $130,000.

Ether continues to gain strength, which is being mirrored by many altcoins.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating between $100,718 and $105,819 for the past few days, indicating a balance between supply and demand. A positive sign is that the price has held above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, signaling that the bulls are hanging on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.
Market intelligence firm Santiment highlighted in a post on X that the failure to rise above $105,000 has caused impatience among retail traders, which “historically is a bullish sign for prices.”

CRWV stock climbed as much as 26.3% in New York trading, pushing its market capitalization above $38 billion. Trading volumes were more than double the daily average, according to Yahoo Finance data.
The stock was last seen trading around $81, up 23% on the day.

While less than 1% of Coinbase’s active monthly users were reportedly affected, the expected remediation and reimbursement expenses range from $180 million to $400 million, as the exchange pledged to repay all phishing attack victims.
Despite the attack on the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, investor sentiment remains optimistic, with the Fear &amp; Greed Index remaining firmly in the “Greed” zone above 69, according to CoinMarketCap data.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, the executive said that Bitwise&#x27;s Bitcoin price prediction model is driven exclusively by supply and demand metrics. Hougan laid out the specific figures driving the forecast:
&quot;We know that miners will produce 165,000 BTC this year. Already, publicly traded companies have bought more than that. ETFs are at $6 billion in inflows. We think governments are going to be buying. We see this sort of structural difference between demand and supply.&quot;

Speaking to Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Carbone argued it is in the best interests of the US to pass comprehensive stablecoin regulations to protect US dollar hegemony in global markets, which has bipartisan appeal and support. Carbone said:
&quot;These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it&#x27;s stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it&#x27;s a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote.&quot;

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. 
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.

Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.
In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

                              <span>As cryptocurrency gains in popularity and price, some criminals are taking to violent measures to steal funds from high-profile crypto holders.
Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. 
In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.
The most recent incident in Paris, France compelled the French Ministry of the Interior to hold a meeting to address the rising trend. Here are just seven of the most high…</span>

Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement, according to a filing on May 15.
Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the rejection does not reverse the company’s victory in the case. The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.

Alderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”

In a May 16 announcement, AsiaStrategy said it is partnering with Sora Ventures to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Sora previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan’s first corporate Bitcoin treasury.
The stock market took immediate notice of the announcement. Top Win stock closed the trading day at $7.50 on May 15, but traded at $12.12 in premarket at the time of writing — a jump of over 60%.

                              <span>Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?
Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic&#x27;s technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”

XRP price is forming a bullish V-shaped recovery pattern targeting $3.40.

A 53% surge in open interest to $5.06 billion signals bullish sentiment.

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earned $250 million from its complete exit from crypto-friendly Nubank.

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based; Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

A report from enterprise-grade digital assets platform Fireblocks shows that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations.
The report, published May 15, surveyed 295 executives across traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies and payment gateways. Almost half of the respondents (49%) said they already use stablecoins in payments, while 23% are conducting pilot tests and another 18% are in the planning stage.
Only 10% of institutions surveyed said they were undecided about stablecoin adoption.
