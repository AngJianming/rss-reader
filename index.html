                              <span>In Go version 1.24, the encoding/json package introduced the omitzero tag, making the behavior of ignoring zero-value fields more explicit and customizable. This article provides a detailed explanation of how to use the omitzero tag.
omitzero Tag


The omitzero tag is used to control which zero-value fields should be omitted when serializing Go objects into JSON. Unlike the omitempty tag, which omits empty-value fields, zero values and empty values, while similar, are not equivalent in Go. For example:
For the time.Time type, the zero value is &quot;0001-01-01T00:00:00Z&quot;, which is not considered an empty value.
For a slice field like IntSlice []int, both [] and nil are considered empty values.
omitzero




Precise control: Explicitly omits zero-value fields, rather than empty-value fields.

                              <span>Introduction
Are you experiencing issues with starting a foreground service from a BroadcastReceiver when handling phone calls in your Android application? This is a common challenge faced by developers, particularly after Android 15, which introduced new restrictions on starting foreground services directly from a background context. In this article, we will explore effective strategies to work around these restrictions and ensure your application can provide the necessary functionality, such as showing a floating view with caller information during phone calls.
Understanding the Foreground Service Start Restriction
Starting from Android 15 (API level 31), there are new limitations on using foreground services in certain contexts. The ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException occurs when …</span>

This week was less about tinkering with new AWS services and more about turning the spotlight on the community side of cloud development.
If you’ve been following along, you know I’ve spent the last few weeks deep in LocalStack. Testing services, simulating chaos, debugging stateful nightmares (good times!). But this week, I shifted gears. Instead of code, I focused on content and connection.
The LocalStack community is incredibly helpful. People show up daily with questions, bug reports, and clever workarounds. It’s a support-driven space that works. But I’ve been noodling on a bigger goal:
How do we turn a support community into a space for shared learning, storytelling, and collaboration?

                              <span>&quot;Why can&#x27;t building a website feel as fast as drafting a tweet?&quot;
A tired founder stares at a blank landing page and thinks: &quot;Code, hosting, SEO, deployment—why so many moving parts?&quot; That frustration sparked Vilcos.





  
  
  Chapter 1 — Foundations


Vilcos unites three modern stacks:
Chainlit + Agno – a model-agnostic AI co-developer that edits HTML/CSS/JS on demand.
Vite + Tailwind – hot-reload frontend workflow for instant feedback.
Docker + Fly.io – global deployment in a single command.
Workflow overview:
# Modern installation (new!)
npx create-vilcos-app my-website

# Standard operations
./vilcos start    # Live AI editing &amp; preview
./vilcos publish  # Static build &amp; SEO post-processing
./vilcos deploy   # Multi-stage Docker → Fly.io edge

Get started in seconds with npx create-vilcos-app my-website and a polished black-themed template appears, ready for conversation-driven edits.
Drag-and-drop builders limit creativity. Vilcos lets you talk to your site:
Ask – &quot;Add a pricing table with three tiers.&quot;
See – Chainlit patches the code in seconds.
Refine – &quot;Switch to dark mode.&quot; Immediate.
An embedded knowledge base keeps the AI grounded in your exact template files, avoiding hallucinations and ensuring output matches your site&#x27;s existing structure.
Docker compiles; Caddy serves; Fly.io distributes.
Zero-config HTTPS and anycast IPs.
Add a CNAME in Cloudflare, run fly deploy, and you&#x27;re online worldwide in under a minute.
Speed – Idea → live site in one sitting.
Simplicity – One repo, one CLI, no CI pipeline gymnastics.
Portability – Templates are plain files—take them anywhere.
Flexibility – Works with any AI model that Agno supports.
Accessibility – Install with a single command using the familiar npx pattern.
Join the project, open a chat with Vilcos, and build something remarkable.
Built with practical caffeine and a commitment to making the web faster to create.</span>

It starts as a harmless reflex.
Someone drops a half-baked feature in sprint review, proudly demoing what amounts to a glorified loading spinner - and your brain whispers, “Seriously?” Another project dies on the vine, killed by the same meetings that birthed it, and you think, “Of course it did.” You’ve seen this show before. You know how it ends.
Congratulations. You’ve unlocked senior cynicism.
It feels like insight. Like armor. But it’s actually rust. And if you don’t watch it, it will eat straight through your usefulness.

Reflection is a powerful feature in Go that allows you to inspect and manipulate objects at runtime. In this blog post, we&#x27;ll explore how to use reflection with nested structs and interfaces, specifically focusing on printing the contents of structs that implement a certain interface. We will fix the example provided, ensuring that our code dynamically recognizes interface implementations without explicitly mentioning the structs.
The Problem with Your Reflection Code
In your provided code, you are encountering an &#x27;ErrUnhandledType&#x27; error when trying to directly recognize the PrintStr interface during iteration. This occurs because the Field(i).Interface() method retrieves the value of the struct, not the pointer that implements the PrintS…</span>

                              <span>I’m not the most careful person when it comes to laptops — or any device, really. At one of my former jobs, I ended up replacing my machine three times (not proud of it 💀). By the third round, I was already sick of going through the whole setup process again. That pain led me to discover something that changed my workflow for good: dotfiles.
In this article, I’ll walk you through what dotfiles are, why they matter, how to version-control them, and how to back up and restore your full dev setup without the pain.
Dotfiles are hidden configuration files on Unix-based systems (like macOS, Linux, or WSL). They store preferences for tools like your shell, text editor, terminal multiplexer, and more — allowing you to personalize your development environment.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment. This marked the third time BTC has broken through six figures since it reached the milestone on Dec. 5, 2024, and again on Jan. 20, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. 
The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports.

Galaxy anticipates listing on the Nasdaq, a tech-focused US stock exchange, by the middle of May, pending approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange, on which the company is already listed, and shareholder approval at a special shareholders meeting on May 9.
Shareholders at the meeting must approve redomiciling Galaxy Digital in the US state of Delaware, known for its business-friendly regulations, before the process can move forward, according to an announcement from the company.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it&#x27;s also created a blind spot that&#x27;s holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They&#x27;re incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That&#x27;s why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

                              <span>Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has received regulatory approval to expand crypto derivatives trading across Europe.
Gemini secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), allowing the exchange to offer crypto derivatives in the European Union, it announced on May 9.
“Once we commence business activities, we will be able to offer regulated derivatives throughout the EU and EEA [European Economic Area] under MiFID II,” said Gemini’s head of Europe, Mark Jennings.
According to the exec, the MiFID II license is a big milestone in Gemini’s European expansion, putting it one step closer to offering derivatives to both retail and institutional users.

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

After hitting $104,000, BTC/USD is retracing to establish support, but the fate of $100,000 is among the concerns for market participants.

Current price action represents an important battleground, as measured from the $75,000 lows this year.

The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

                              <span>American fast food outlet Steak ‘n Shake has announced it will begin accepting Bitcoin as payment at all locations starting on May 16.
The firm said on X on May 9 that it was making the cryptocurrency available to more than 100 million customers, adding that “the movement is just beginning,” before signing off as “Steaktoshi.” 
The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.

                              <span>Fresh off its most recent Bitcoin purchase, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet is raising more funds through another bond issue to expand its growing crypto treasury.
Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows.
“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said.

The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

                              <span>Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings (MARA) nearly tripled its Bitcoin holdings over 12 months, according to its newly released Q1 results.
However, its Bitcoin production fell, and total earnings slightly missed Wall Street estimates in Q1.
MARA, formerly Marathon Digital, saw its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings increase to 47,531 BTC, up 175% from the 17,320 BTC the firm was holding at the end of Q1 2024.
MARA holdings inch closer to $5B after Bitcoin pump
MARA holds the second-largest amount of Bitcoin among all publicly traded companies, according to CoinGecko data. Strategy (MSTR) holds the number one spot with 555,450 Bitcoin.
The holdings represent a total value of approximately $4.9 billion, based on Bitcoin’s current price of $102,660 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap dat…</span>

                              <span>Ripple has made a slew of acquisitions to control key transaction rails and route them through XRP and its stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD), drawing comparisons to Japanese investment firm SoftBank. 
The $1.25-billion acquisition of Hidden Road on April 8 allows Ripple to use RLUSD as collateral in the firm’s prime brokerage products. Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.
Omni Network co-founder Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.

                              <span>A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission has blasted her agency over its settlement letter that could finally end the Ripple legal saga. 
The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.
