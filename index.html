                              <span>How ETH Is Received in Smart Contracts — receive(), fallback(), and Common Mistakes


Smart contracts on Ethereum can receive ETH directly. But what actually happens when someone sends ETH to a contract? And why do some transactions fail silently while others go through?
Let’s dive deep into how Ether is handled in Solidity, the differences between receive() and fallback(), and some key developer mistakes you should avoid.
When you send ETH to a contract, one of two functions will be triggered based on the context:
receive() external payable
fallback() external payable
These are special functions in Solidity that aren’t called directly in code. They get triggered under very specific circumstances.
receive() Run?


The receive() function runs when:
A contract receives ETH with empty calldat…</span>

However, while the ocean of theory is vast, it&#x27;s the crashing waves of practice that truly test the truth. After participating in several campus projects and contributing to some open-source communities, I&#x27;ve increasingly felt that choosing the right development framework is crucial for a project&#x27;s success, development efficiency, and ultimately, the user experience. Recently, a web backend framework built on the Rust language, with its earth-shattering performance and unique design philosophy, completely overturned my understanding of &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; web development.

Although the idea of a Drupal template marketplace seems like a good idea to me and could be a good boost for Drupal as a product and therefore for the Drupal community, these are my doubts, fears, or a mix of everything.
When we talk about a Drupal template marketplace, the WordPress marketplace comes to mind. It&#x27;s true that this marketplace works and has possibly been one of WordPress&#x27;s successes in becoming the product it is today, as it allowed someone without technical knowledge to have a beautiful and operational website.

This document presents a thorough reflection on how to establish a readable, rigorous, and coherent coding syntax for the use of parentheses and braces in PHP. Rather than perpetuating historical conventions inherited from languages like C or Java, it is based on a clear principle: code should reflect the logic of the language, not formatting habits.
The goal of this proposal is to define a style that is:
Unified: one rule applies uniformly across all relevant constructs—functions, control structures, or inner expressions;
Systematic: each rule follows directly from syntactic structure, not from lexical category (keyword, identifier, etc.);
Consistent: treatment is aligned across similar cases, with no arbitrary exceptions;
Easy to remember: by eliminating contextual variations…</span>

Without a cohesive strategy, organizations face increased risk, inconsistent access controls, and compliance blind spots.
In this article, we break down the top IAM challenges enterprises face in multi-cloud setups and how to address them with scalable, secure solutions.
Each cloud provider has its own IAM structure. AWS uses IAM roles and policies, Azure relies on role-based access control (RBAC), and GCP leverages Identity-Aware Proxy and IAM roles.

Today we’ll cover an essential part of building web APIs: handling file uploads and form fields in a single POST request.
Accepting files using POST /uploadfile

Saving uploaded files locally
Handling form data with file uploads
FastAPI depends on python-multipart to process form and file data.
pip3 install python-multipart

Here’s a complete FastAPI snippet to accept a file and form fields:

# Create an uploads directory if it doesn&#x27;t exist

Mitigation: How to Prevent SQLi
SQL injection (SQLi) allows attackers to manipulate database queries to extract, modify, or delete data. A critical first step in exploiting SQLi is identifying:
The type of database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
The version of the database
The structure of the database — tables and columns

                              <span>As a junior in computer science, I embarked on a project last semester to build a campus second-hand trading platform. This led me to discover the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was at a crossroads, needing a framework robust enough for peak end-of-semester trading and simple enough for a Rust novice like me to grasp quickly. Hyperlane didn&#x27;t just meet my expectations; it exceeded them. I&#x27;m excited to share my journey with this impressive framework.
ctx: A Thoughtfully Designed Abstraction


My initial foray into writing route functions with Hyperlane introduced me to its Context (or ctx). I was immediately struck by its design. I remember when I first needed to retrieve the request method. In more conventional Rust HTTP frameworks, the code would typically look like this:

                              <span>This isn’t one of those stories where everything goes according to plan.

In fact, it rarely did.
I didn’t get great grades in high school.
I didn’t enter university right after.
I even changed majors — and later, careers.
My path was all over the place.
One day, while working in my old industry, I found myself asking:  
Why am I doing this? What’s the point?
That question led to action.

I quit.

I joined a coding bootcamp.

I studied full-time for 4 months.

I landed my first role at an international blockchain company.

Then I left again—this time, for Tokyo.
After a year learning Japanese, I restarted my career here as a full-time software engineer at a startup.
It’s been uncertain, messy, and totally worth it.
You don’t need a perfect start to end up in a good place.
Progress isn’t always loud — but it compounds.
Your past doesn’t disqualify your future.

I&#x27;ve been using Claude Code daily for personal development projects. However, I&#x27;ve encountered several cases where Claude struggled to solve complex problems dependent on specific library versions during web app development.
After extensive experimentation, I discovered that enabling Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for Claude Code significantly improves its problem-solving capabilities. This article shares my findings and practical implementation.
While Claude Code is powerful, it sometimes lacks current information about rapidly evolving libraries and frameworks. This limitation becomes particularly evident when dealing with:
Version-specific compatibility issues
Recent library updates and breaking changes
Latest best practices and solutions

                              <span>This is a submission for the Runner H &quot;AI Agent Prompting&quot; Challenge
I built a Job Search AI Agent that analyzes your resume and searches for job listings that best match your profile. Instead of manually filtering job boards, the AI reads your resume, understands your experience, and intelligently finds job opportunities aligned with your skills, role, and interests.
It’s like having a personal AI recruiter that works on your behalf — 24/7.
Here’s how it works:
Upload your resume (PDF or text)
The AI parses your experience, skills, and role
It then runs targeted searches across job boards
Finally, it summarizes and suggests job listings that match your profile





  
  
  How I Used Runner H


Runner H’s AI agent framework made it easier to structure tasks like:
Resume parsing (using NLP)
Role-based matching
Job board search automation
Prompt chaining to create a decision-making loop (e.g., reject mismatches, refine search)
I built prompts that:
Understand the candidate’s background
Convert it into a structured &quot;search query&quot;
Evaluate results based on match score and keywords
Summarize the top roles with direct links
It felt like using a smart co-pilot for job hunting.
📌 Use Case:
Instead of you finding jobs, jobs find you — based on what you’re best at.
🌍 Impact:
Saves time and mental effort
Increases relevance of job matches
Helps junior and mid-level devs who are unsure how to “market” their resume
This can easily be extended for recruiters, freelance platforms, or even career counselors.
This challenge pushed me to build something not only technical, but practically useful in everyday life.
🙏 Shout-out to Runner H and Dev.to for encouraging creative use of AI agents.

                              <span>Lithium-ion batteries have some emerging competition: Sodium-based alternatives are starting to make inroads. Sodium is more abundant on Earth than lithium, and batteries that use the material could be cheaper in the future. Building a new battery chemistry is difficult, mostly because lithium is so entrenched. But, as I’ve noted before, this new technology has…</span>
