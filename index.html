Recently, I dug deep into two of the most prominent players in the vector search space: Milvus and FAISS. What I found was a set of fascinating trade-offs that go far beyond benchmarks or marketing claims.
In this post, I’ll walk you through my hands-on reflections, design considerations, and some microbenchmarking notes I gathered while testing these tools on a 10M vector dataset.
At their core, both Milvus and FAISS address the same fundamental challenge: performing efficient similarity search across high-dimensional vector spaces, a task critical for applications like semantic search, retrieval-augmented gener…</span>

                              <span>Introduction


MobX is a popular state management library for React applications. It allows you to store and modify data reactively, with components automatically updating when the state changes.

However, when using MobX with Server-Side Rendering (SSR, e.g., in Next.js), an important question arises: where and how to initialize the store?

The wrong approach can lead to state leaks between users, bugs, and even security issues.
In this article, we&#x27;ll explore two main approaches to initializing MobX store, their pros and cons, and show how to work correctly with store in SSR applications.
The simplest and most common way is to create the store once and export it from a file:
// store.js
import { makeAutoObservable } from &#x27;mobx&#x27;

class MyStore {
  value &#x3D; 0
  constructor() {
    makeAutoOb…</span>

If you have read any article or a book on system design then you probably know what vertical and horizontal scaling is and benefits of horizontal scaling. Before I explain how to setup proper horizontal scaling with Postgres let me make a case when you should not try this.
Simplicity: Single node database means you can run your database out of the box. Although I recommend you run PGTune for a quick preset or visit postconf a full breakdown


Easier backup and recovery: No need to think about state across replicas when creating backups or applying a backup.


No network overhead especially with write heavy operations.


A temporary fix: If need a fix right now, this will provide an instant relief.

                              <span>As AI systems grow smarter, they also accumulate more and more information. But just like humans, they need to forget sometimes.
Why? Because memory isn&#x27;t free.
Letting an AI agent remember everything forever leads to bloated storage, slower performance, and poor decisions based on outdated or irrelevant facts. This is where forgetting or aging strategies come in — smart techniques that help an AI agent manage its memory by keeping what matters and discarding the rest.
Imagine you’re building a personal assistant AI. It remembers your calendar events, past queries, contacts, and preferences. Over time, its memory could grow endlessly. Without forgetting strategies, it might:
Waste time scanning old, irrelevant data.
Run up high storage costs.
Make decisions based on stale context.

In this article, we’ll explore how to learn any programming language efficiently using the 80–20 rule, spaced repetition, and project-based learning — backed by cognitive science and real developer experience.
The Pareto Principle, or 80–20 rule, suggests that 20% of your efforts yield 80% of your results. In programming, this means that a small subset of language features — like core data types, loops, conditionals, and functions — makes up the majority of what you’ll use daily.

                              <span>👀 Overview:


Have you tried to implement getter/setter in your entity of TypeORM?
I try to map a private _userType to a public userType getter/setter.
TypeORM still reads/writes the raw _userType field without calling get/set.
The conversion code inside get userType() / set userType() is never applied
❌ Have you tried like below ?
&quot;Error: Missing column value in entity for: user_type

@Entity()
export class User {
  @Column({ name: &#x27;user_type&#x27;, type: &#x27;int&#x27; })
  private _userType: number;

  // These will NOT be used by TypeORM:
  get userType(): string {
    return this._userType &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1 ? &#x27;ADMIN&#x27; : &#x27;USER&#x27;;
  }
  set userType(val: string) {
    this._userType &#x3D; val &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;ADMIN&#x27; ? 1 : 0;
  }
}


✅ The Fix: Use transformer
Works perfectly — no more errors, and clean transformations. Instead of getters/setters, use TypeORM’s built-in transformer option on the column
@Entity()
export class User {
  @Column({
    name: &#x27;user_type&#x27;,
    type: &#x27;int&#x27;,
    transformer: {
     to(role: string): number {
       return role &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;ADMIN&#x27; ? 1 : 0;
     }
     from(value: number): string {
       return value &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; 1 ? &#x27;ADMIN&#x27; : &#x27;USER&#x27;;
     }
   };
  })

In it he talked about a future where the infrastructure was more adaptive, allowing you to write code once and have it modify how it runs automatically. This brought me back to something I did about 7 years ago, where I had the same code running in both a container and in Lambda. It wasn&#x27;t quite what Allen was talking about because it was a deploy time decision as to how it would run. That got me thinking about what it would take to make something like that work automatically.

  Overview


This guide walks through the process of creating a simple Geometry Dash-inspired game using Amazon Q, Bedrock, and various creative tools. The main steps include:
Drafting a game idea and refining it into a structured prompt using Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku)
Generating the initial game project with Amazon Q CLI
Enhancing visuals and audio using Figma, Stable Audio &amp; Claude 3 Sonet, and fonts from itch.io
Writing a helpful README.md with assistance from Amazon Q CLI
Amazon Q CLI installed and configured
Python installed on your system
To kickstart the project, I drafted my initial game idea and used Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku) to help refine it into a well-structured prompt for Amazon Q.
My initial idea:

What This Part Will Cover:
Introduction to the series and what the final app will do
Project setup (Go modules, folder structure)
Installing Gin and other necessary packages
Setting up SQLite with GORM
Creating models (User, maybe Post as a preview)
Implementing user signup and login with password hashing
Basic testing using Postman or curl
In this series I will explain everyting from setup to implementation, for coding part I will post in 3 parts and for explaination of code it will be a single and last part. this is a simple blog app where user can post, update and …</span>

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months

What if you could prove you&#x27;re over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. 
The need for better age verification today
We&#x27;re witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors&#x27; access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach.

                              <span>Key points:

XRP derivatives markets turn bearish amid reducing institutional demand, suggesting further downside for XRP price.

XRP’s descending triangle breakout could lead to a decline toward $1.96.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 45% since April 7 lows to trade at $2.31 on May 27. But the price remains 31% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns about XRP’s ability to rise higher.
Will XRP’s price drop from the current levels in the coming days?
XRP derivatives data lean bearish  
One of the clearest signs that there could be trouble ahead for XRP is the presence of neutral funding rates and decreasing open interest (OI) in its futures markets.
Funding rates are periodic payments made between long and short traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep prices ali…</span>

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.

Marathon’s record revenue surge occurred days after Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, a development attributed by some analysts to Japanese bond market turbulence, which saw bond yiel…</span>

                              <span>Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. 
The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. 
“S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications.

The United Kingdom is leading the world in increasing cryptocurrency ownership among its population in 2025, outpacing economies including the United States, according to a new study by Gemini.
Gemini, the US-based crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, on May 27 released its latest “State of Crypto” report, giving insights into changes in the global adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).
Based on a survey of 7,200 adults across the US, Europe, Singapore and Australia, the report found that Europe has been leading the way in growing crypto ownership, with the UK in front.

Bitcoin’s RSI has dropped 15% and is now below the overbought threshold.

Bitcoin futures flip bearish with a 43% decline in perpetual CVD.

Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as long as a key support level holds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price hit fresh all-time highs of nearly $112,000 on May 23, gaining 50% from its April 1 lows. According to analysts, BTC price is now “showing signs of easing momentum” as it consolidates. 
Bitcoin’s rally to $111K triggered buyer fatigue
BTC’s recent run to $111,000 pushed the daily relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone at 79.6. However, “signs of easing momentum” have emerged as the RSI dropped by 15% to 67, said market intelligence firm Glassnode in its latest report, adding:

The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

                              <span>Blockchain.com is stepping up its presence in Africa, targeting markets where governments are beginning to implement crypto regulations.
The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.
“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.
The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. 
Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.
From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:

                              <span>Thailand is preparing to let tourists spend cryptocurrency via credit card-linked platforms as part of a broader strategy to modernize its financial system and embrace digital assets.
The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from Bangkok Post and The Nation. 
The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.
Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.

French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.
In one recent alleged kidnapping attempt on May 13, three men tried to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, in broad daylight in Paris.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
