Hi, I&#x27;m Sharon, a product manager at Chaitin Tech. We build SafeLine, an open-source Web Application Firewall that protects against real-world web threats like injections, web shells, and bot attacks. Our emergency response team also tracks non-HTTP vulnerabilities that impact frontend and dev environments like this one.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been over a year since I wrote Entering the World of AI Mechanics, and I happened to come back to it today as I&#x27;ve been reading and thinking a lot about the role of AI in engineering as well as in the wider world.
A year is long enough for several quantum leaps in genAI. Of course new models have come out since then, but the fact that I wrote this before agentic AI was not only a thing, but a regular part of my workflow, makes it feel quaint.
A year ago, my main experience with AI was adding it as a code snippet-generating tool to one of the apps I work on in my Day Job, and thus my point of view came from thinking about the user experience of a feature we added that wouldn&#x27;t always act in the way a user (or us, the programmers) expected it to, and how to adjust to that uncertainty.

                              <span>Hello, curious coders! 🧑‍💻 Today, we&#x27;re diving into a fun string manipulation and graph problem from LeetCode — Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String. We&#x27;ll break it down step-by-step and walk through a clean and efficient solution using Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find). Let&#x27;s get started! 🚀
You&#x27;re given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length. Each index in these strings represents an equivalency relationship — for example, if s1[i] &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27; and s2[i] &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;b&#x27;, then &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; are equivalent. These equivalencies follow the rules of an equivalence relation:
Reflexive: &#x27;a&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27;
Symmetric: If &#x27;a&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;b&#x27;, then &#x27;b&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;a&#x27;
Transitive: If &#x27;a&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;b&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;c&#x27;, then &#x27;a&#x27; &#x3D;&#x3D; &#x27;c&#x27;

👋 About Author

Hi, my name is Sharon. I&#x27;m a product manager at Chaitin Tech. We build SafeLine, a high-performance open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) that helps defend against real-world threats like code injection, web shells, and malicious bot traffic. While SafeLine focuses on HTTP traffic, we also track and respond to non-HTTP vulnerabilities that may affect our clients’ environments.
In March 2025, Chaitin researchers discovered a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apusic Application Server (AAS) — an enterprise-grade JakartaEE-compatible middleware. The vulnerability stems from unsafe Java deserialization in the IIOP protocol and allows unauthenticated attackers to exe…</span>

                              <span>Understanding the difference between a thread and a process is fundamental to building scalable and efficient systems.
A process is an independent program in execution.
It has its own memory space, including code, data, and system resources.
Starting an application (like a browser or server) creates a new process.
A thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process.
All threads in a process share the same memory space and resources, but each has its own call stack and program counter.



Concept
Analogy




Process
A house


Thread
People living in the house


Shared memory
Rooms and furniture (shared by all)


Stack
Each person&#x27;s backpack (private)



Process: Running the Chrome browser.
Threads: 


One for the user interface,
One for each tab,
One for rendering,
One for background tasks.



Feature
Process
Thread




Memory
Has its own memory space
Shares memory with other threads


Overhead
Higher (more OS resources)
Lower (lightweight)


Communication
Requires IPC
Can use shared memory


Fault Isolation
Crash in one doesn’t affect others
Crash in one can crash the whole process


Creation Time
Slower
Faster



Threads enable concurrency, improving responsiveness and throughput.
Processes provide isolation, which is safer for unstable or critical tasks.
Choose based on:



Speed vs. Safety

Available memory/CPU

Need to share or isolate data











Understanding threads and processes helps you make better choices when designing everything from web servers to distributed systems.</span>

I built Travel Itinerary Builder - an AI-powered service that transforms scattered travel booking confirmations into organized, comprehensive trip plans through simple email forwarding. No apps, no accounts, just email.
The Problem: Travelers receive confirmation emails from various sources (airlines, hotels, car rentals, restaurants) creating a mess of scattered information that&#x27;s time-consuming to organize manually.
The Solution: Forward booking confirmations to a unique trip email address and receive back beautiful, AI-enhanced itineraries with:

                              <span>Traditionally, Java developers have followed the same standard flow: write Java code, compile it to bytecode, and run it on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While this has worked well, it comes with trade-offs: slow startup, high memory usage, and a dependency on the JVM at runtime.
Now, thanks to tools like Spring Native and GraalVM, we can compile Spring Boot applications into native executables, binaries that start in milliseconds and consume a fraction of the memory. This lets Spring Boot apps run as fast and light as Quarkus, without having to change to a different framework.
In this article, I’ll explain what native compilation means, how it works, and why it makes a big difference for modern applications like microservices and serverless functions.

We often have come across this problem where we sign up for stuff and later wonder, &quot;Why am I paying for this again?&quot; and also we have so many bills paid via different payments apps and email is the only place where we get notifications from all these app payments. I built the Subscription &amp; Purchase Intelligence Hub to fix that!
Just forward your e-receipts (even PDFs!) and related email chats to one Hub address.
AI figures out the financials: It uses OpenAI to grab the vendor, product, price, and category from your receipts.
You can access the app live app here
Forward all your bills and reciepts to postmtest06@gmail.com to analyse.

You: &quot;Can you help me style my navbar?&quot;
AI: &quot;Sure! Can you share your navbar code?&quot;
You: *pastes 50 lines of JSX*
AI: &quot;What about the CSS?&quot;
You: *pastes another 100 lines*
AI: &quot;Where is this component used?&quot;
You: *explains folder structure*
AI: &quot;Can you describe what it currently looks like?&quot;
You: *tries to describe UI in words*
AI: *generates code*
You: &quot;That&#x27;s not what I wanted at all...&quot;
