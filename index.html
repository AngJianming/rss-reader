Bitcoin price consolidates as resistance at $105,000 prevents rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are slightly bearish, but historical data suggests that a sudden bullish move should not be ruled out.


Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range over the past seven days as the $105,000 level remains the overhead resistance to break.

Bitcoin unable to crack $105,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC&#x27;s price has been oscillating between its resistance level at $105,000 and $101,500, where it has found support.
“$BTC is stuck in a narrowing $101.5K–$104K range,” said Swissblock in a May 16 post on X.

Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Siu pointed to the $3 trillion global student loan market as an untapped opportunity for the crypto industry. He said moving even 10% of that market onchain could significantly boost DeFi’s growth.
“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages.

XRP is retesting a falling wedge breakout, which could lead to a rally toward $3.60.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.
Will XRP’s price sustain the recovery or drop further in the coming days? Let’s examine.

New Bitcoin price targets leverage interplay with gold to deliver $200,000 and higher this year.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model.

Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end.

 
Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.
In his latest analysis, X analytics account Apsk32 argued that the four-year BTC price cycle should provide unprecedented highs this year.

Bitcoin “power curve” delivers $200,000+ target
Bitcoin following gold to new all-time highs is a popular theory among bulls. Historically, BTC/USD follows XAU/USD higher with a delay of several months.

Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt (USDT) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network, offering enhanced privacy, autonomy and resilience. 
Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. 
A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin (BTC) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Developm…</span>

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

                              <span>The Pacific US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands has passed a bill allowing its small constituent island of Tinian to launch a stablecoin, overriding an earlier veto by the territory’s governor.
The 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House voted 14-2 to undo Governor Arnold Palacios’ April 11 veto of the bill, which allows the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The territory’s nine-member Senate had revived the bill on May 9, voting 7-1 in a two-thirds majority to override the veto, which then needed a two-thirds majority in the House to pass.

There hasn&#x27;t been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.
Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. 
The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.
Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.

“This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added.

“If you receive a message claiming to be from a senior US official, do not assume it is authentic,” the agency said.  
If US officials’ accounts are compromised, the scam could become far worse because hackers can then “target other government officials, or their associates and contacts, by using the trusted contact information they obtain,” the FBI said.

“After review of this case, this Office and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General have determined that this prosecution is consistent with the letter and spirit of the April 7, 2025 Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General,” Clayton wrote.

                              <span>Ethereum’s Bullish Momentum Continues



Ethereum (ETH) entered mid-May 2025 with remarkable strength, surging from around $1,800 at the start of the month to trade near $2,625 as of May 14. This impressive rally, marked by a more than 45% gain in just two weeks, has been underpinned by robust technical signals and renewed investor confidence.
Technical analysis reveals that Ethereum is trading well above its key moving averages, with the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) providing dynamic support around $2,517. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 77, indicating overbought conditions but also sustained buying pressure. Additionally, trading volumes have surged, confirming genuine buying inte…</span>

While full-fledged IDEs provide advanced debugging and project management tools, they can also be bulky and slow. If your goal is quick code execution, then browser-based environments are more than enough.
I’ve handpicked the best online compilers for popular languages like C++, Python, PHP, Java, Go, and even more niche options.

ForgeMT is a centralized platform that enables engineering teams to run GitHub Actions securely and efficiently — without building or managing their own CI infrastructure.
It provides ephemeral runners (EC2 or Kubernetes), strict tenant isolation, and full automation behind a hardened, shared control plane.
Before ForgeMT, every team in Cisco’s Security Business Group had to build and maintain their own CI setup — leading to duplicated effort, inconsistent security, slow onboarding, and rising operational overhead.
ForgeMT replaced this fragmented approach with a secure, scalable, multi-tenant platform — saving time, reducing risk, and accelerating adoption.
⏱️ 80+ engineering hours saved/month per team
📦 40,000+ GitHub Actions jobs/month

Let’s break it down step by step.
Building a dynamic list in JavaScript is a great way to learn how web pages respond to user actions without reloading. 
This project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to control the behavior. The main idea is to let users add and remove items from a list directly on the page.
First, the page has a simple form with two fields: one for the title and another for the note. …</span>

Unlike traditional security controls, AppSec guardrails for AI agents are designed to monitor behavior, restrict unauthorized actions, and verify the integrity of generated code in real-time. For tools like Cursor and Windsurf, they provide oversight at both input (user prompts) and output (code suggestions), reducing the likelihood of data leaks, insecure configurations, or flawed logic being committed to production.
Guardrails combine SAST, SCA, RBAC, secret scanning, and policy-as-code to enable scalable security enforce…</span>

                              <span>Setting up a proper Python environment is crucial for writing clean, testable, and maintainable code — whether you’re building a simple script or a full-scale data science pipeline.
In this article, I’ll break down how to manage your Python environments using two tools: venv (Python’s built-in virtual environment tool) and pipenv (a higher-level tool for dependency management). You’ll also learn how to test your code with pytest.
&#x60;python -m venv env
Activate it&#x60;

On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

Install packages
pip install requests

Install pytest for testing
pip install pytest

Freeze dependencies
pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt

Deactivate when done
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

test_calculator.py
from calculator import add

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) &#x3D;&#x3D; 5

Run your tests with:
pytest

🟦 Option 2: Using pipenv (Modern and Streamlined)
🔧 Step-by-Step Setup
pip install pipenv

Create an environment and install a package
pipenv install requests

Install pytest as a dev dependency
pipenv install --dev pytest

Activate the shell
pipenv shell

Run your tests
pytest

Exit the shell
exit

🧪 Why Use pytest?
Fast test discovery
Plugins for coverage, mocking, fixtures, etc.

Even as newer languages like Rust and Python rise in popularity due to their safety guarantees and modern features, C++ remains integral to countless mission-critical applications. From operating systems and game engines to high-frequency trading platforms and real-time simulations, the language continues to prove its value.

I want to explore why C++ remains so relevant in 2025, what challenges it faces, and how it fits into the broader programming ecosystem alongside Rust and Python.
C++ is more than a language; it&#x27;s an entire ecosystem built over decades. Its dominance in high-performance domains stems from:

If you&#x27;re just joining, you can check out how it all started in the first post of the series.
In the previous post, we added parsing error tracing. 
Now we are prepared to expand the syntax and add other constructs to augment the language. It&#x27;s been a while since the last post, but development didn&#x27;t halt. Let&#x27;s resume by adding one special feature: variables -- named local in Jsonnet.
This will be a nice addition that paves the way for more interesting stuff.
Naming is hard and I felt that the AST value type wasn&#x27;t expressing it properly. There were things being dealt with as values, like BinOp. They are not really values, but expressions.
So I opted to represent everything as an expr, as we had at the beginning.
Since locals can be declared in multiple ways…</span>

The Wisconsin Investment Board reported no spot Bitcoin ETF positions in its 13F filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 15, liquidating all 6,060,351 IBIT shares it reported holding from the previous quarter. 
The more than 6 million IBIT shares are worth around $355.6 million at current prices.
SWIB was one of the first state investment funds to provide Bitcoin exposure to US retirees when it bought $164 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 — the same quarter the Bitcoin products launched.

                              <span>Global foreign exchange and payments platforms are lobbying hard against stablecoins, which stand to significantly disrupt their business models, investor Kevin O’Leary said during a keynote address at Consensus 2025. 
Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been “hiccups” in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. 
Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

                              <span>There is an ongoing race across the world for Bitcoin accumulation, according to Eric Trump, the second-eldest son of US President Donald Trump. Speaking at a crypto conference in Toronto on May 15, Trump said that from families to government funds, “everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now.” 
The remarks came during a panel at Consensus 2025. Sharing the stage with Asher Genoot, the CEO of Bitcoin (BTC) mining company Hut 8, Trump said Bitcoin adoption has been incredible.
“I&#x27;m traveling. I&#x27;m on a plane. Everybody in the world is trying to hoard Bitcoin right now. Everybody. I hear it from sovereign wealth funds. I hear it from the wealthiest families. I hear from the biggest companies.”

                              <span>Key takeaway:

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

                              <span>Asset tokenization is set to accelerate the movement of capital across traditional markets, according to Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Speaking with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Nazarov said the shift will boost capital velocity in asset classes such as treasuries, equities, private credit, commercial debt, and real estate.
&quot;I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily,&quot; Nazarov said on May 14.

The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

Bid-side liquidity is staking up on the downside near $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 36% from its April 9, five-month low at $74,500. However, its failure to decisively break above $106,000 has sparked concerns about whether a sharp correction is possible in the coming days.

                              <span>The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions.

                              <span>Coinbase has reportedly fired a group of customer support agents following their alleged involvement in social engineering attacks on users. The contracted agents were based in India. 
According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase&#x27;s chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. 
The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.

Qiao Wang, a core contributor to Alliance DAO, said in a May 15 X post that he may have been a victim of one of these attacks. He said a scammer notifie…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows dropped over 90% from $3 billion to $228 million in four weeks. 

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks. To understand the potential impact on Bitcoin, let’s examine four key periods of significant spot ETF activity and their correlation with BTC pri…</span>
