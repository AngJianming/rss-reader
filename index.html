                              <span>Throughout my journey with Laravel, I’ve learned a lot of lessons that helped me improve the way I work and write code. Here are 10 key takeaways that made a real difference for me:
If you&#x27;re using Blade, make sure to add required to your HTML fields. If a user submits an empty required field, it shouldn&#x27;t even reach the server. Save your server from handling unnecessary requests.
Always validate incoming data. Avoid using request()-&gt;all(), especially if you&#x27;re using guarded in your model—it could allow unexpected data to slip through.
resource or apiResource routes


This helps keep your routes organized and prevents your route files from becoming bloated and hard to manage.
Don&#x27;t put logic inside your Resource files. It can cause N+1 problems, especially when returning collections. It also makes your code easier for others to understand. Always use pagination for large datasets.
Avoid N+1 problems by eager loading any relationships you know you&#x27;ll use. Laravel 12 introduced automatic eager loading, but it&#x27;s still good practice to manage it explicitly when needed.
Laravel Logs and tools like Laravel Telescope are great for debugging and monitoring. Just make sure to secure Telescope if you’re using it in production.
Regularly delete old logs and unused files. For example, when users update profile images, delete the old one. This helps you save disk space in the long run.
Use Guards, Policies, or Gates to protect your data. Never assume users should have access just because they’re logged in.
Don’t let a few users flood your system with requests. Throttling is your first line of defense against DDoS attacks.
Use cache for data that’s accessed frequently and doesn’t change often. It makes a big difference in performance.
Final Thought:

You&#x27;re building for all kinds of users، always be prepared for the worst-case scenario.</span>

The real world assets market is not yet fully formed, but it has already been divided into categories of projects that belong to the general trend of tokenized real-world assets.
Centralized Stablecoins: Popular coins such as USDT from Tether or USDC from Circle are inherently RWAs. Token issuers lock fiat currencies and government or commercial securities in their accounts as collateral. They then issue stablecoins, which is a tokenization.
Private Lending: MakerDAO, the DAI stablecoin issuer, is one player in this field. In mid-2022, the company opened a $100 million tokenized credit…</span>

                              <span>Docker Compose has fundamentally changed how developers approach containerized applications, particularly when coordinating services that depend on one another. This tool replaces manual container management with a structured YAML-driven workflow, enabling teams to define entire application architectures in a single configuration file. 
For Ubuntu environments, this translates to reproducible deployments, simplified scaling, and reduced operational overhead. This guide provides a fresh perspective on Docker Compose installation and usage, offering deeper insights into its practical implementation.

In this article I&#x27;ll walk you through what Kernel Memory is and how you can use the C# version of this library to quickly index, search, and chat with knowledge stored in documents or web pages.
At its core, Kernel Memory is all about ingesting information in various sources, indexing it, storing it in a vector storage solution, and providing a means for searching and question answering with this indexed knowledge.

is a Hook?


At its core, a hook is just a function that gives function components the ability to use React features like state, side effects, and context.
useState gives you state


useEffect runs side effects


useRef, useMemo, and others give access to React internals



But hooks are more than just function calls — they plug directly into React’s rendering engine.
React stores hooks in a list and matches them by call order.
On each render, it:
Starts from the top of your component.

Calls your hooks one by one.

Primeiro, precisamos ter variáveis para usar como Bearer Token na requisição/mutation.

You’ve created files. You’ve deleted files. You’ve yelled at permission errors. Now it’s time to ask the real questions:
“What the heck is my system even doing right now?”
Welcome to your first taste of Linux surveillance (the good kind). This is where we learn to peek under the hood without accidentally setting anything on fire.

                              <span>When building APIs with Django Rest Framework, one common requirement is to make sure each user only sees their own data.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to map records to authenticated users, filter them correctly, and secure your API endpoints. Whether you’re building a dashboard, CRM, or SaaS app — this guide will help you do it right.
🎥 Watch the full tutorial here:









  
  
  🚧 The Problem


By default, your API might expose all records in a model to any authenticated user. That’s a privacy and security risk — especially for multi-user apps.
We need a way to:
Automatically assign a record to the logged-in user
Filter querysets so users only see their own records
Prevent unauthorized access through permission checks
Here&#x27;s how to fix that in DRF 👇

                              <span>Let&#x27;s start with the obvious, Java is great. It’s got a garbage collector, it keeps your hands mostly clean of manual memory management, and it’ll let you write code that just works. Until it doesn’t... Until that sweet little app of yours starts slowing down like it’s stuck in mud and your grafana memory usage chart looks like it’s climbing Everest with no plans to come back.
So yes... Java handles memory for you. But if you don’t understand what it’s doing behind the scenes, it’s only a matter of time before your app becomes jabba the hutt.
Let’s talk about how not to let that happen.
Java&#x27;s garbage collector is fantastic. It takes care of unused objects so you don’t have to manually free() them like in C. But here’s the catch -  the garbage collector only collects what it knows is garba…</span>

                              <span>Bancor, the creator of a smart contract-based automated market maker, is suing Uniswap for patent infringement, alleging the decentralized finance exchange has used its technology without permission and profited significantly from it.
According to the May 20 announcement of the lawsuit, Bancor designed the technology in 2016 and patented it in January 2017. The technology underpins the “constant product automated market maker,” which involves using mathematics to add or withdraw resources from a liquidity pool. The application subsequently led to two issued patents.
Bancor alleges that Uniswap used the invention to create its protocol, launched in November 2018. The two organizations are considered competitors in the sector of decentralized finance (DeFi).

                              <span>Key takeaways:

An end-of-month Bitcoin price close above $102,400 would set the highest monthly close ever, proving the bull market continues at a rapid pace.

Over $3 billion in Bitcoin short positions are vulnerable above $107,000, creating a “liquidation magnet” that could send BTC price to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) is 11 days from potentially setting its highest monthly candle close in history. After achieving a record weekly close of $106,407 on May 18, BTC could secure a new monthly high by closing above $102,400 this month.

                              <span>Five years ago, Brian Armstrong wanted employees of his cryptocurrency exchange to refrain from expressing political views at work. Now, the Coinbase CEO seems to be open to involvement with Republican figures, including members of US President Donald Trump’s inner circle.
In a May 13 X post, Armstrong said members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team, spearheaded by Elon Musk, though not set up as an actual department, would be welcome to implement cost-cutting changes at Coinbase after leaving the US government. 
Armstrong offered to set up an accelerated onboarding process with the exchange, responding to an interview in which at least one DOGE staffer felt ostracized from Harvard University, where he had been enrolled.

The Investigative Task Force (ITU) was dissolved via a May 19 decree signed by Milei and Justice Minister Mariano Cúneo Libarona, government documents revealed. 
“The Research Task Unit is dissolved” after completing its mandate, the translated version of the decree read.
The task force is being dissolved despite pressure from opposition groups, which are seeking to activate an investigative commission as soon as May 20, local media outlet Clarin reported.

Although blockchains and DApps are critical, crypto industry stakeholders often prioritize applications based on adoption principles and revenue distribution. DApps won&#x27;t function without their underlying chains. The markets must uphold blockchains for long-term value generation.
The value perspective is wrong 
Blockchains and DApps should work collaboratively to coordinate their functions for better usability. Instead, analysts create a binary between chains and DApps based on Web2&#x27;s structural frameworks.

On May 19, 16 Democratic senators broke from the party line to pass a motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor. Some of the same Democrats had held up the bill in early May when they withdrew support, citing corruption concerns over President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings.
The bill’s opponents hailed lawmakers’ refusal to support it but were soon taken aback when the senators reversed their position. The lightly amended legislation contained no provisions regarding World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture.

                              <span>India’s Supreme Court questioned the government’s lack of regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies despite imposing taxes on digital assets like Bitcoin.
According to the Indian legal news outlet LawChakra, the country’s Supreme Court expressed concern over the increasing use of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies, which remain largely unregulated.
“This is a whole parallel economy running with such coins, and it is a danger to the economy of the country,” Justice Surya Kant reportedly said during a recent hearing related to an ongoing investigation into a Bitcoin transaction.
Kant said that while the government has implemented crypto taxation, it has failed to regulate the space.
“If you can tax it at 30%, also please regulate it as you have recognised it by taxing it,” the judge said.…</span>

                              <span>Binance has filed a motion to dismiss a $1.76 billion lawsuit brought by the FTX estate, accusing the defunct crypto exchange of trying to deflect blame for its own failure.
Filed on May 16 in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court, Binance’s legal team called the suit “legally deficient,” stating that FTX’s collapse was not triggered by market manipulation or hostile action but by internal misconduct.
“Plaintiffs are pretending that FTX did not collapse as the result of one of the most massive corporate frauds in history,” the filing said, pointing to Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried’s conviction on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy.
FTX’s estate alleges that Binance received billions in crypto during a 2021 buyback deal, funded improperly with customer assets.
Binance rejects this claim, stating that “…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is nearing a golden cross that has led to 45%–60% price rallies in the recent past.

Fundamentals like rising M2 supply and easing trade tensions support a bullish outlook.

Bearish divergence and overbought conditions show there’s still a risk of BTC falling below $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) will likely confirm a “golden cross” on its daily chart by the end of May, a technical pattern whose occurrences in recent years often preceded rallies.

Previous golden crosses led to 45%-60% BTC price rallies
As of May 20, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average (50-day SMA; the red wave) was eyeing a close above its 200-day SMA (the blue wave) for the first time since October 2024, forming a golden cross.

Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed that less than 1% of its transacting monthly users were affected in an attack that may cost the exchange up to $400 million in reimbursement expenses, Cointelegraph reported on May 15.
However, the “human cost” of this data breach may be much higher for users, according to Michael Arrington, the founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital.
“Very disappointed in Coinbase right now. Using the cheapest option for customer service has its price,” Arrington said in a May 20 X post, adding:

                              <span>South Korea’s Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung proposed creating a stablecoin tied to the Korean won to prevent capital outflows and strengthen national financial sovereignty.
Speaking during a recent policy discussion, Lee argued that a won-based stablecoin would allow South Korea to retain wealth domestically while reducing reliance on foreign-issued digital assets like USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), according to The Korea Herald.
Currently, South Korean law prohibits the issuance of domestic stablecoins, forcing local exchanges to rely on US dollar-based alternatives.
Between January and March, crypto exchanges in the country recorded 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) in asset outflows, nearly half of which were linked to foreign stablecoins, the report said.

A major crypto theft has sent shockwaves through the industry, with $330 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) stolen. Experts say this was a social engineering attack and not a technical hack. 
Investigations led by blockchain analyst ZachXBT suggest the victim was an elderly US citizen who was manipulated into granting access to their crypto wallet. On April 28, 2025, ZachXBT detected a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth $330.7 million. 
The stolen BTC was quickly laundered through more than six instant exchanges and converted into the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Monero (XMR). Onchain analysis shows the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no previous record of s…</span>

                              <span>Update May 20, 11:20 am UTC: This article has been updated with comments from DCG.
Genesis has launched a pair of lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of fraud, reckless mismanagement and siphoning more than a billion dollars in value from the now-bankrupt crypto lender.
On May 19, the Delaware Court of Chancery unsealed a complaint detailing how DCG allegedly used Genesis as a corporate ATM, draining funds through self-serving loans and concealed transfers while presenting a false image of financial health.
Through their court-appointed Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), Genesis creditors claim that over a million digital coins — worth about $2.1 billion — were funneled away, even as Genesis edged toward collapse.

Bitcoin is not in line to cancel its attack on all-time highs, says the Bitcoin Fundamental Index (BFI).

BTC price strength remains “intact,” says Swissblock Technologies, removing the risk of a double top.

Historically, a return to within 10% of all-time highs delivers price discovery almost every time.

Bitcoin (BTC) does not risk a “double top” bull market reversal with its trip past $107,000, new analysis says.

Trump signed the bill into law on May 19, known as the TAKE IT DOWN Act, an acronym for Tools to Address Known Exploitation by Immobilizing Technological Deepfakes on Websites and Networks.
The bill, backed by first lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to publish, or threaten to publish, nonconsensual intimate images, including deepfakes, of adults or minors with the intent to harm or harass them. Penalties range from fines to prison.

In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.
She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.
In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

                              <span>Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.
