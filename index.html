Network protocols serve as the foundation of the internet. HTTP/1.0, HTTP/2.0, and WebSocket each support modern web applications in different scenarios. This article will implement the core logic of these three protocols using pure Python sockets to gain an in-depth understanding of their underlying communication principles. All example code in this article has been verified in a Python 3.8+ environment, covering core technologies such as network programming, protocol parsing, and byte stream processing.
HTTP/1.0 is an early stateless request-response protocol based on TCP connections. It uses short connections by default (closing the connection after each request). Its request consists of a request line, request headers, and a request body, wh…</span>

Here’s what broke, how we replaced it, and why our new setup is better.
When we started, we needed:
Fully isolated VMs per build
Fast boot times
Persistent volumes for Docker layer caching
Auto-suspend and resume behavior to save costs
Fly.io promised all of that:
Firecracker under the hood
Easy per-app VM isolation
Wake-on-request semantics
Persistent volumes that could auto scale to 500 GB
So we launched a dedicated Fly app per customer. Builds would trigger the app via HTTP, and Fly would spin up the VM. Caching worked. Boot times were decent. It felt clea…</span>

The @PropertySource annotation is used to tell Spring to load a specific properties file from a location provided in the annotation. It is used in conjunction with @Configuration at the class level. It allows you, as a developer, to externalize the configuration of your application.
@PropertySource?



It allows you to load properties files from any location.
In Java 8+, you can repeat this annotation many times, allowing you to load multiple configuration files.
It supports the usage of placeholders using Spring Expression Language syntax.
You can handle missing files by ignoring them if they are not found.
Property override: if you have many properties with the same name, the last definition will override the first one.

By extracting usernames and passwords stored in memory or on disk, attackers can move laterally within a network, escalate privileges, and access sensitive systems and data. In this article, we’ll explore what credential dumping applications are, how they work, popular tools used in real-world attacks, and how you can defend against them.

That means half the developers celebrating perfect synthetic scores are actually delivering poor performance to their real users.
Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights run in perfect, controlled environments. They simulate an &quot;85th percentile user&quot; — but their simulation is usually wrong for your specific audience.

I faced a hard time creating a HackerRank contest without proper guidance and clear documentation.
If you’re a fellow tech enthusiast facing the same challenge, you’re not alone! To help others avoid the confusion I went through, I’ve documented my full experience and provided a step-by-step guide to setting up a contest.
The complete markdown is there in my git: HACKER-RANK-CONTESTS



I hope this helps all the aspiring contest creators out there. Happy coding!
The below documentation will guide you how to create a coding contest
what&#x27;s given the below is a part of DSL(Domain Specific Language) which is like a pesudo code that will create code blocks of your defenition.



DSL helps you create code stubs like main function and solution function…</span>

                              <span>PostgreSQL&#x27;s Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) underpins everything from crash recovery to PITR and streaming replication. But streaming WALs safely and reliably, especially into cloud or container-native environments, can be fragile.
Enter pgrwl: a modern WAL receiver written in Go that gives you:
📆 WAL streaming to local/S3/SFTP
🔐 On-the-fly encryption + compression
🐳 Kubernetes-native workflows
📊 Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
🧹 Automatic retention + cleanup
⚙️ Safe WAL handling, with proper fsync guarantees
Let’s explore how it works under the hood.
🧪 Note: pgrwl is a research project, inspired by PostgreSQL’s built-in tools like pg_receivewal, and is
official source code and streaming behaviors.
pgrwl serves as a starting point to explore more cloud-native, container-friendly, …</span>

Isso é feito a partir da apresentação de várias regras e expectativas sobre como um código PHP deve ser formatado, além de proporcionar o desenvolvimento de ferramentas as quais podem revisar e validar se o código se encontra conforme esperado.
Essa PSR substitui o PSR-2, apresentando recomendações sobre contextos e funcionalidades mais modernas (tendo em vista que o PSR-2 foi apresentado em 2012, um contexto mais antigo).

                              <span>I am 22 and 3rd year CS undergrade. Always Wanted to make my own apps but one thing that stopping me (other then that i didn&#x27;t know to build Apps) was Money you have to pay fee to publish app on Play store or App store. 
Then I introduced you to progressive web apps (read about it below).
Now i can make Apps with zero money. 
Thanks GOD
Story


My semester breaks are going on and I decided to do something productive so participated in an hackathon. It was about spreading awareness about finance and economy. Thought finance is always boring what if i can create an app where people can learn in fun way So let me introduce you to FinLingo financial quiz app. Simple but effective. 
Tech Stack i used:
PWA (progressive web apps) : applications that you build by using web technologies, and that can be installed and can run on all devices, from one codebase. PWAs provide native-like experiences to your users on supporting devices.


In short you can build an APP at once and can be used in any platforms (mac, linux, windows, Android, ios). Also no need to worry about publishing fee (It&#x27;s completely free).


Next.js : For both frontend + Backend. It can be use for full-stack development. SEO friendly.


Supabase : To Store my app data. An SQL database. 



This is how i created my first App for free and you can do the same.

Rest-Assured is a Java-based library that simplifies testing RESTful APIs. Its syntax is expressive and BDD-like, making tests readable and maintainable.
Example:
This test sends a GET request to retrieve a post and asserts that the response has a status code of 200 and the userId is 1.
