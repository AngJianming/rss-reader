                              <span>Doodles’ non-fungible token (NFTs) sales surged by 97% in the last 24 hours as digital collectible traders anticipate the project&#x27;s token generation event and airdrop. 
On May 8, data from CryptoSlam showed Doodles NFT sales topping $1.1 million, nearly doubling the previous day’s total. The spike placed Doodles in the third spot for daily NFT sales, following DMarket and Courtyard NFTs.
Over the past week, Doodles recorded $2.6 million in total sales volume — up 368% from the week prior — ranking fifth among all NFT collections, according to CryptoSlam.
The surge comes ahead of the launch of Doodles’ long-awaited DOOD token. The project announced on May 7 that the token generation event will take place on May 9.

Pectra introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, a change that Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, described as “the single greatest UX upgrade to Ethereum so far.” Ambire is among the wallet providers that have already rolled out support for the new features since Pectra went live yesterday.
Ambire’s announcement shared with Cointelegraph explains that EIP-7702 brings smart account functionality to existing user accounts, letting them temporarily act as smart contracts.

Bitcoin’s realized cap is beating records and has almost reached the $900 billion mark.

The market is laying the foundations for a “potentially significant price breakout,” new analysis says.

Profit-taking is not hindering the overall bull market rebound.

Bitcoin (BTC) is setting new all-time highs in network value as BTC price action eyes a return to six figures.
Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirms new record highs for Bitcoin’s realized cap.
Bitcoin realized cap reflects “growing conviction”
Bitcoin is worth more than ever in US dollar terms if its market cap is measured by the value at which the extant supply last moved onchain.

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.
And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?

The leak included a MySQL database dump shared publicly online. It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows.  
Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.

Acting comptroller Rodney Hood said in a May 7 letter that banks and federal savings associations can buy and sell crypto they hold in custody at customers’ direction.
The OCC added in a press release that financial institutions can also outsource bank-permissible crypto activities, including custody and execution services, to third parties in compliance with applicable law.
“Additionally, these banks may provide other custody services, including record keeping, tax or reporting services for their customers,” Hood said in a May 7 video posted to X.

Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza will dominate discussions, but North Korea’s increasing cyber threats and crypto hacks have become a major concern requiring a coordinated international response, Bloomberg reported on May 7, citing people familiar with the plans.
The people said North Korea’s nefarious cyber operations are alarming, as the stolen crypto has become a key funding source for the regime and its programs.

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency passed Senate Bill 21 with no amendments on May 7 in a 9-4 vote along party lines. The bill has already passed the Texas Senate, in a 25-5 vote on March 6.  
SB 21 would establish the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” controlled by the state’s comptroller — currently Glenn Hegar — who would be permitted to invest in digital assets that have obtained a market cap of at least $500 billion over the last twelve months, which would currently only include Bitcoin (BTC).

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…</span>

The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.

All operations — both reads and writes — go through the same path, and everything seems to flow naturally. But then the system starts to grow. Users multiply. The number of queries increases exponentially. And you will realize a simple truth: most of the requests are merely read operations.
Browsing products. Scrolling through a timeline. Searching for posts. Each of these actions consumes I/O, CPU, and memory resources on the database. At first, you may think, &quot;It’s just reading — how heavy can it be?&quot; But reads, when there are enough of them, can gradually and surely choke the system.
That’s when read replicas become a weapon you must consider.

In this article, we will address the issue of the &#x27;file not found&#x27; error related to the SimpleBLE library in C++. If you are trying to compile a project in Xcode and encounter the error simpleble/SimpleBLE.h file not found, this guide will walk you through potential solutions to make your header files visible and ensure successful compilation.
Understanding the Issue
When working with libraries in C++, specifically with the SimpleBLE library version 0.9.1 in Xcode 11.7 on a Late 2013 iMac running macOS Catalina 10.15.7, you might face challenges in linking the necessary header files. This issue often arises due to incorrect project settings, missing paths, or improperly configured build settings.

                              <span>When it comes to website security, just having HTTPS in your URL bar isn’t enough anymore. These days, it’s the baseline, not the finish line. Installing an SSL certificate is a solid first step, but if you&#x27;ve come across the warning &quot;HSTS Missing from HTTPS Server&quot;, it means there&#x27;s still a gap in your defenses that hackers could take advantage of.
In this post, we’ll break down what that error actually means, why it’s something you shouldn’t ignore, and how to fix it, one step at a time.
If you&#x27;re seeing that error, it means your server isn’t sending a specific HTTP response header called Strict-Transport-Security. This header is what activates HTTP Strict Transport Security, or HSTS for short.
Here’s the short version: HSTS tells web browsers, &quot;Hey, this site should only ever load over …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re building a Laravel API that allows users to upload multiple images (like attachments to tasks), this guide will walk you through how to do it — simply and clearly.
In your controller (TaskController), make sure to validate that users can upload multiple images:
$validator &#x3D; Validator::make($request-&gt;all(), [
    &#x27;title&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required|string|max:255&#x27;,
    &#x27;attachments&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;nullable|array&#x27;,
    &#x27;attachments.*&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;file|mimes:jpg,jpeg,png,pdf,docx|max:2048&#x27;,
]);

This accepts an array of files (attachments[]) with allowed formats and size.
Each task can have many images, so we need a table to store them.
Run this command:
php artisan make:migration create_task_attachments_table

Edit the file:
Schema::create(&#x27;task_attachments&#x27;, function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table-&gt;id();

                              <span>In this post, I’ll explain how Flyte’s Dynamic Workflows work and what they mean for your ML pipelines.
Flyte Workflows define a pipeline as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This abstraction allows the representation of complex processes with branches, but without loops. Consequently, each new execution of the DAG must start from the beginning or from an intermediate point, which can impact compute efficiency—more on that in future posts.
Flyte’s workflow lifecycle has two main phases: compile time and run time.
During compile time, Flyte serializes the code, packages it, and uploads it to blob storage, making it accessible to the control plane. This process is called registration. The focus here is on speed and efficiency, primarily by performing type checking without executing the code. I…</span>

                              <span>Selenium is one of the most popular and widely used automation test suites to automate web applications. It can perform from very basic to advanced actions on a web page, such as clicking on a button, sending text in the input field, selecting an item from a drop down, performing mouse-keyboard actions, etc. However, there are instances when Selenium WebDriver cannot interact with certain web elements and that is when JavascriptExecutor is used!
JavascriptExecutor is an interface that facilitates a mechanism to execute JavaScript through Selenium WebDriver. This interface provides various methods to run JavaScript on the selected window or the current web page. Selenium WebDriver supports different language bindings and JavascriptExecutor is available in each of those bindings. JavaScript …</span>

This consistent formatting raises an interesting question: how does wc manage to format its output correctly without reading all files in advance? In this article, we&#x27;ll explore the mechanics behind the wc command, the alignment practices it employs, and why the output retains perfect formatting even when handling large files.
Understanding the wc Command in Bash
The wc command, short for &quot;word count,&quot; is a powerful utility in UNIX and Linux environments that allows users to count lines, words, and characters in files. Specifically, the -l flag counts lines, meaning wc -l  will output the number of li…</span>

According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company&#x27;s local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. 
Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide…</span>

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

                              <span>Threat group COLDRIVER is using new malware to steal documents from Western targets, according to a May 7 report from Google Threat Intelligence. The malware, called LOSTKEYS, shows the evolution of the group from credential phishing to more sophisticated attacks.
According to the Google report, the new malware is installed through four steps. The process involves a “lure website” with a fake CAPTCHA, a PowerShell script downloaded to the user’s clipboard, some device evasion, and retrieval of the final payload. Lastly, the malware is installed.

LOSTKEYS is capable of stealing files from extensions and directories. It can also send system information and running processes back to COLDRIVER. The address from which the parts of the attack come is “16…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways: 

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC).
The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities, a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. 
Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war ches…</span>

Bitcoin price hangs near $97,000 as traders await today’s FOMC minutes.

Bitcoin holding $95,000 as support is key for bullish price expansion in the short term.

Select altcoins are holding their respective support levels, opening the gates for a short-term rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to knock down the immediate resistance at $97,895 and challenge the all-important $100,000 level. Crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin are positive about further gains as they have acquired 81,338 Bitcoin over the past six weeks.
