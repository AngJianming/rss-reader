Meet SafeLine, a free and open source Web Application Firewall with a semantic detection engine, dynamic protection, and over 16.4K GitHub stars. It’s built for real-world attacks—and it&#x27;s free and open-source.

SafeLine can dynamically obfuscate HTML and JS on each page load, making your source code unreadable to crawlers and bots.
/admin/login becomes a random encrypted path like /a8c9f1, and changes every refresh

Real users see no difference. Crawlers see... nothing.
🧪 BurpSuite Test Result:

Crawler blocked from indexing. Browser loads normally. Extra latency: ~1ms.

💡 You can apply this selectively:
Encrypt only admin paths
Whitelist static files (CSS/JS) to avoid layout issues

This feature brings more flexibility, transparency, and debugging ease to your CI/CD pipelines. Let me break it down for you with a simple example.
You can now:
    Add a Deploy Spec file (YAML format) to your source repo.
    Reference it in your EC2 Deploy action in CodePipeline.
    Enjoy real-time EC2 instance-level deployment status in the console.
Think of this like appspec.yml from CodeDeploy—but with added power directly from your pipeline.
Let’s say you’re deploying a web app to EC2 instances using CodePipeline.
Previously:
    Deployment steps were defined manually in the pipeline or via the default behavior.

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of computer science and software development. Whether you&#x27;re preparing for technical interviews, optimizing code performance, or simply looking to deepen your understanding of how programs work, mastering DSA is essential. In this guide, we&#x27;ll explore fundamental concepts, their real-world applications, and how they can help you write efficient code.
Why Learn Data Structures and Algorithms?
Efficient problem-solving is at the core of programming. Data structures help organize and store data, while algorithms define the steps to manipulate that data. A strong grasp of DSA leads to:
Faster and more optimized code – Choosing the right data structure can drastically improve performance.

In this article, you’ll learn how to build a simple monitoring script that checks a website’s availability every minute, logs the result, and lets you watch everything in real time with tail -f.
Step 1: Create the Python Monitoring Script
To begin, we need a Python script that uses curl to check if Google.com is reachable and logs the result with a timestamp. Open your terminal and create a new Python file using your preferred text editor. 
This script does the following:


Sends a simple HTTP request to https://google.com using curl.

This command executes the script and attempts to reach https://google.com using curl . The result of this operation, along with a timestamp, is logged in a file named google_monitor.log located in your home…</span>

Try it now: Upload Time Estimator
Last month, I was uploading a 2GB video project over a flaky connection. The browser gave me zero insight—just a spinning wheel of doom.
&quot;How long is this going to take?&quot; I wondered. &quot;Should I cancel and try later? Will it finish before my meeting?&quot;
That frustration sparked an idea. What if I built a tool that could predict upload times before users commit to them?
We often overlook upload experiences in our applications. But for users, especially those with slower connections, this can be a major pain point.
Consider these stats:
47% of users expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less
40% will abandon a s…</span>

As a developer of HarmonyOS, mastering the Cangjie development language will become an indispensable skill. Today, we start from scratch and share with you the development tutorial of the Cangjie language. What we are going to share today is setting up the development environment.
Cangjie provides development plugins in both DevEcoStudio and VSCode. As HarmonyOS developers, we may be more accustomed to using DevEcoStudio. So today, we will take DevEcoStudio as an example.
First, you need to download the Cangjie plugin. Pay attention to the matching versions of the Cangjie plugin and DevEco-studio. I sugg…</span>

                              <span>How an AI Interview Coach Helped Me Land My Dream Dev Job


Let me start with this: I’ve always dreaded technical interviews. The whiteboard questions, the algorithm drills, the awkward silences when you blank out mid-sentence... it’s brutal. And when you&#x27;re applying for dev jobs in a competitive market, even one bad round can cost you that dream offer.  
That’s why I decided to try something different. Instead of cramming alone or burning out on LeetCode marathons, I let an AI interview coach take over. Yep, I used a platform called OfferGoose — and spoiler alert: it changed everything.  

The first thing that surprised me? OfferGoose isn’t just a glorified question bank. It’s a fully interactive AI interview assistant, tuned specifically for dev roles — front-end, back-end, full-stack, s…</span>

                              <span>Type Inference


TypeScript can often guess types automatically. This is called type inference. When you assign a value without an explicit type, TypeScript infers it. For example:
let count &#x3D; 10;         // inferred as number
let message &#x3D; &quot;Hello&quot;;  // inferred as string

The compiler knows count is a number and message is a string from these initial values. Type inference helps keep code concise and still type-safe. You don&#x27;t always need to write : number or : string because TypeScript figures it out.
Less code: You skip repetitive type annotations.


Safety: Even with fewer annotations, TypeScript checks types.


Readability: Code stays clean while avoiding obvious errors.



However, you can still add type annotations if it makes the code clearer or if a variable’s type isn’t obvious. …</span>

Whether you’re switching careers, coming from a non-traditional background, or learning code between your 9–5 and family time, this guide is for you. Let’s break into front-end development together — no CS degree, no gatekeeping, just real resources that helped me and thousands of others start coding.
Front-end developers build the parts of websites and web apps you see and interact with. If you&#x27;ve ever customized your Myspace page back in the day or edited a Tumblr theme, you were doing baby dev work without even knowing it!
You’ll learn to work with:

CSS for design and layout
JavaScript for interactivity

The AFP-led Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT) said in a May 18 statement that it seized nearly 25 Bitcoin (BTC), alongside the mansion and car, which are together worth a total of 4.5 million Australian dollars ($2.88 million).
The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company.

Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…</span>

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
&quot;We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.&quot;

                              <span>Michael James, the head of institutional business development at Douro Labs — the company that developed the Pyth high-speed blockchain oracle network — told Cointelegraph that oracle networks like Pyth are disrupting the $50 billion financial data industry that provides critical price information to exchanges, brokerages, trading firms, and other institutional entities.
In an interview at Consensus 2025, the executive said that Pyth Network&#x27;s data pull model sets it apart from traditional pricing oracles, allowing customers to pay for data on demand, reducing costs for institutions reliant on real-time market data.

From Mossel Bay to Witsand and Plettenberg Bay to Knysna, Bitcoin has become popular among shop owners and travelers alike for a multitude of reasons.
“We’re seeing the early signs of a parallel, permissionless economy emerging across an entire region,” James Caw, founder of SimplB — a local crypto asset provider — told Cointelegraph, “where small businesses benefit from faster, lower-cost digital payments and where people have more options to earn, send and receive sound money securely.”

Fintechs in the front, decentralized finance (DeFi) in the back: the DeFi Mullet.
Today’s fintech companies offer excellent user experiences but are constrained by traditional financial infrastructure — siloed, slow, expensive and inflexible. Meanwhile, DeFi provides lightning-fast, cost-effective, interoperable infrastructure but lacks mainstream accessibility.
The solution? Combine fintech’s distribution and user experience with DeFi’s efficient back end.
The mullet is inevitable
Fintech companies heavily rely on traditional financial (TradFi) infrastructure that is siloed, slow to deploy and run, and costly to maintain. This inefficiency limits their control over costs and product offerings and has potential infrastructure risks. Fin…</span>

Speaking in a recent interview, Melker cited growing institutional interest and diminishing volatility as key factors that could drive the next leg up.
“250K this year, totally possible,” Melker said, adding that Bitcoin (BTC)’s volatility has declined significantly in recent years.
“It used to be about three times as volatile as the S&amp;P. Now it’s less than two times.” He pointed to increased involvement from pension funds and ETF issuers as evidence of a more mature, stable market.
The shift, he argued, reflects a broader trend of institutional adoption. “The more institutional money, the more Wall Street money, the mor…</span>

The meeting, which also involved the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, comes at a time when over $193 billion in digital assets are staked across major proof-of-stake (PoS) networks.
However, despite the massive scale of participation, staking remains in a legal gray zone in the US as regulators wrestle with its classification under existing securities law.
The previous SEC administration also took enforcement actions against major players such as Kraken, Coinbase, and Consensys due to their staking services. The agency, under pro-crypto President Donald Trump, has recently d…</span>

Prosecutors believe the men may have had ties to Teratech as independent contractors, but are still waiting on official confirmation from the company’s CEO.
The three deported were Chinese nationals Jinping Duan, Tian Jianyun and Zheng Guanglong, who did not have official entry records into the country. Paraguayan authorities and Interpol believe the men illegally entered through Brazil or Bolivia.

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

Traders expect a Bitcoin price pullback to $90,000, but a bull flag could break out to new highs if profit taking near the range highs reduces. 

On-chain data suggests the current profit taking is too weak to extinguish Bitcoin’s current price momentum. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent the bulk of the week pinned below $104,000 to $105,000, which many analysts have labelled as a resistance zone, but an alternative view suggests that BTC is simply consolidating within a bull flag. 
A bull flag is a continuation pattern that is characterized by a period of sideways price action following a sharp uptrend, and when the structure confirms or breaks from the trendline resistance, the uptrend continues.

                              <span>Crypto entrepreneurs and their families in France will receive enhanced security measures amid a recent rise in crypto-related kidnappings in the country, Politico reported.
According to the May 16 report, the measures include priority access to police emergency lines, home security assessments, and safety briefings from French law enforcement to ensure best practices are being followed.
France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau introduced the security measures as part of a broader effort to counter the recent wave of attacks.
&quot;These repeated kidnappings of professionals in the crypto sector will be fought with specific tools, both immediate and short-term, to prevent, dissuade and hinder in order to protect the industry.”

                              <span>Tokenization could open new opportunities for retail investors to access traditionally restricted asset classes, according to Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of Robinhood Crypto, who called it “very important for financial inclusion.” 
Speaking at the Consensus 2025 event in Toronto, Kerbrat said that some real-world assets, such as real estate and private equity, are available only to up to 10% of the US population. “You need to be an accredited investor to invest in private equity right now,” he said. 
“How many people can afford a house or an apartment in New York?” he elaborated. “But you can get a piece of it with fractionalization, through tokenization. And so we think it makes it a lot easier to be exchanged, a lot more accessible for everybody.”

Filecoin and Lockheed Martin adapted the system for use in space and successfully tested it, Belcher said during the Consensus 2025 conference in Toronto.
The IPFS enhances privacy and security compared to traditional web protocols, such as HTTP, by identifying data based on its content rather than its location. This has additional benefits for data transmission in space, Belcher said.

According to a May 16 Bloomberg report, Sequoia Capital Managing Partner Roelof Botha’s personal information available through his Coinbase account was stolen after a group of cybercriminals bribed the exchange’s support agents for access to user data. Though Botha had not publicly disclosed his net worth, estimates suggested he had hundreds of millions of dollars in assets.
Coinbase disclosed the data breach in a May 15 blog post, saying that some of its users had been targeted with social engineering attacks after the criminals had access to their personal account information. The comp…</span>
