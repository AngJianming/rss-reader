The inverted index originates from search engine technology and can be regarded as the cornerstone of search engines. Thanks to the inverted index technology, search engines can efficiently perform operations such as database searching and deletion. Before elaborating on the inverted index, we will first introduce the relevant forward index and compare the two.
In a search engine, the forward table uses the document ID as the keyword, and the table records the position information of each word in the document. When searching, the system will scan the word information in each document in the table until all documents containing the query keyword are found.
The structure of the forward table can be represented by the following box diagram:

Connecting PHP to an Access database can sometimes lead to frustrating errors, such as segmentation faults, particularly when using PDO and ODBC. If you&#x27;re encountering a segmentation fault while trying to connect to an Access DB on Ubuntu 24.04 with PHP 8.3, you’re not alone. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide you with actionable steps to troubleshoot and resolve it.
Understanding the Segmentation Fault
A segmentation fault typically occurs when a program tries to access a restricted area of memory. In the context of your setup—using PDO with ODBC to connect to an Access database—this can happen due to various reasons, such as:
Incorrect ODBC driver settings
Issues with PHP libraries or modules
Mismatched configurations between PHP and the data…</span>

🎮 Step 1: The Game That Started It All – bastet
Forget flashy graphics or touchscreens. My 10-year-old’s first deep dive into Linux wasn’t through Minecraft mods—it was with Bastard Tetris (bastet) on the command line.

This isn’t your regular Tetris. It’s evil. It deliberately gives you the worst pieces possible, and watching my kid giggle every time the dreaded S-piece dropped again was pure joy.
“This game is cheating!”
“Exactly. Welcome to the terminal.”
🎉 It kind of looks like Candy Crush, my kid said, except it&#x27;s all keyboard and no tapping.

  How To, for Web Applications


When a button is clicked, a 100% height sidebar will appear from the left edge of the webpage, squeezing gently the main document content rightwards, to about 250px. The sidebar has a close button that when clicked, it will retract into the left edge of the webpage gently; releasing the main document. This tutorial explains how to create that effect.
The sidebar has a vertical menu, for which, in this project example, the menu consists of hyperlinks. The sidebar is responsive, in the sense that, when the height of the device screen is less than or equal to 450px, the menu list should move upwards, with smaller text.

                              <span>When building web applications with Dash, you may encounter situations where you want to pass a specific string to the pathname property of a dcc.Location component. This issue becomes particularly prominent when the string format includes a question mark (?) intended for queries, such as &#x27;path?query1&#x3D;test&#x27;. However, when it runs, Dash automatically URL encodes the string, leading to improper routing or unexpected behavior. Let&#x27;s explore why this happens and how you can handle it effectively.
Understanding URL Encoding in Dash
URL encoding is a mechanism that converts special characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet. For example, the question mark (?) is a reserved character in URLs used to denote the beginning of a query string. When you pass a string like &#x27;path?…</span>

Decentralizing was turned into a buzz word. But there came reality. As of 2025, most of the blockchain startups failed, and numerous consuming millions before even building a product. So, what&#x27;s going wrong? Let&#x27;s understand the key reasons for this massive failure and what investors, developers, and founders should know before jumping into blockchain.

As per Crunchbase stats, most of blockchain startups fail in the initial 3 years.
Despite raising huge funds their failure rates touched 80%.
The hype reached its peak in 2021–22, but after FTX, Terra Luna, and regulatory clampdowns, the ecosystem has shrunk.

                              <span>As usual, I received JSON data from the backend developer, but it was in a .txt file. I had to download it, copy the content, and paste it into an online formatter to view it properly.
Honestly, I was getting tired of this process, so I started looking for a more convenient solution. That’s when I stumbled upon a website that made things so much easier. If I want to share JSON data with someone, I can simply click &quot;Share&quot; to generate a link instead of sending a file. I just send the link to the other person, and even better, when they open it, the JSON data is already neatly formatted. I think this is absolutely awesome!

Additionally, the link has a one-hour expiration time, after which it becomes inaccessible, ensuring the data remains highly secure.
I continued exploring and discovered that it not only enables quick sharing but also allows you to rapidly generate an API for temporary testing during development. This is incredibly convenient!

Actually, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also run queries here to extract the data I need from the entire JSON dataset, supporting various query languages.

In addition to standard JavaScript code, it also supports JEMSPath, JSONPath, JQ Cmd 

Secondly, it also supports data conversion, allowing seamless transformation between JSON and other data formats, including JS Object, JSON5, JSON Schema,  Query String, Typescript,  Postman Bulk, MXL, YML.

You can manually convert data or directly paste non-JSON data, and it will automatically generate the converted JSON data. For example, you can simply paste the following data:
DEV


Additionally, it can validate whether the provided JSON data meets specific structural requirements, supporting JSON Schema and JSON Type Definition.

Another feature we frequently use is: JSON Diff

In short, I think this tool is an essential asset for programmers, and I’m sharing it with everyone here Online JSON Format Tool</span>

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.
The Justice Department said Chhipa would raise funds for the United Nations-designated terror organization through social media — receiving money online, or traveling hundreds of mil…</span>

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump  administration’s tariffs.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether&#x27;s USDt (USDT), Circle&#x27;s USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) of 2025 Act was blocked by Democrat lawmakers in the Senate on May 8, stalling the bill&#x27;s progress.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP surged on May 8, boosted by risk-on sentiment following US President Donald Trump’s teased trade deal with the UK.

Whale accumulation continues, with the number of addresses holding 10,000+ XRP rising steadily on price dips.

XRP broke above a key falling wedge resistance, increasing the chances of a rally toward $2.80–$3.66.

XRP’s (XRP) price gained 7.50% on May 8 to reach an intraday high of $2.27, mirroring similar upside moves elsewhere in the cryptocurrency market.
Traders pushed the price higher amid Trump’s tariff threats, increased whale accumulation, and favorable chart technicals.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.
To address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

                              <span>US President Donald Trump was reportedly manipulated by a lobbyist tied to Ripple Labs into announcing the XRP token would be part of his plans for a national cryptocurrency reserve.
According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8.
The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement.
“With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…</span>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.
