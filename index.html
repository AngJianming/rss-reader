Omakub is a tool to turn a fresh installation of Ubuntu 24.04 into a friendly system for developers new to Linux. Install it with:
wget -qO- https://omakub.org/install | bash

and reap the benefits!
Optional directions are included for setting up VNC to connect to a remote desktop in the cloud.
I have used Linux for over twenty years. I&#x27;ve run many distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and Arch. There are many reasons why I enjoy Linux such as package management, openness to modification, and philosophy. But this is not about me; it&#x27;s about you!
Linux is a great system. Ubuntu is a fantastic distribution to start with because of its ease to install and setup. It&#x27;s also intuitive and easy to use, especially when coming from Windows or MacOS. It is a free (as in sp…</span>

                              <span>TL;DR: EA CEO Andrew Wilson says the launch window for the next Battlefield is looking a lot clearer now that Rockstar has pushed Grand Theft Auto 6 back to May 26, 2026. Battlefield is locked in for release by March 2026 (with a full reveal this summer), giving it at least a two-month head start before GTA 6 lands.
Wilson also noted that it’s pretty tough for other studios to suddenly pull releases forward just because GTA 6 got delayed, so EA feels good about owning the quieter spring window and maximizing the value they’ve poured into Battlefield.</span>

                              <span>AI projects face security challenges resulting from difficulties in ensuring model integrity and reliability. The Sleepy Pickle and HuggingFace models&#x27; silent backdoors are notable examples of such model security loopholes. 
AI project components comprise data, models, and code. Modifying the data or code often allows for the change of the model component without a trace. Thorough documentation of the creation, operation, and lifecycle of your model’s dependencies, processes, metadata, artifacts, tools, libraries, etc. enables you to protect your AI system from common model breaches like data or model poisoning, model evasion, confidentiality attacks, and model flaws.
Model attestation, similar to a traditional software attestation security strategy, is a practice that enables you to establish a verifiable security supply chain for all system components. It is a strategy that verifies the integrity, authenticity, and lifecycle of your model&#x27;s data, code, and artifacts and their relationship at the different stages of the development lifecycle.
Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) or AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM), in the context of AI projects, is an inventory report you can use for model attestation. It provides an inventory of the components and the dependencies used in building a model. This inventory report should typically include data, model artifacts, dependencies, and their relationships.

                              <span>A variation on our earlier post &#x27;How to Handle File Uploads with Node.js and Express&#x27; (which used express-fileupload). This time, we&#x27;ll use Multer, a powerful middleware for handling file uploads with Node.js and Express.
NOTE: In order to follow this tutorial, you will need the following:
Node.js installed on your machine
Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Express

A text editor or lightweight IDE such as Visual Studio Code





  
  
  Why Choose Multer?


In our previous guide, we showed how easy it is to handle file uploads using express-fileupload. Multer brings additional flexibility and control:
Disk &amp; Memory Storage Engines: Choose between saving files directly to disk or keeping them in memory for immediate processing. Third parties even offer pluggable engines for cloud storage.

                              <span>Introduction
In the world of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), evaluating the quality of generated images is a crucial task. One popular metric for this evaluation is the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score, which typically requires images with three color channels (RGB). However, if you&#x27;re working with single-channel images like those found in the MNIST dataset, this may pose a challenge. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to handle single-channel images and compute the FID score effectively.
Understanding FID Score
The FID score is a statistical distance between the distribution of generated images and the distribution of real images. It uses the activations of a pre-trained Inception model as a feature representation of the images. Under normal circumstances, this model expects…</span>

                              <span>Advanced forms are more than just input fields - they’re user flows, UI components, and accessibility touchpoints all in one. In this tutorial, we’ll walk through building a multi-step HTML form with dynamic validation and custom-styled controls to improve usability, engagement, and form completion rates.
Start by setting up your HTML with container sections for each step. Each form “page” will be displayed or hidden with JavaScript.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

                              <span>A 90-day tariff agreement between the US and China may set the stage for a broader recovery of stock and cryptocurrency markets, as investors look ahead to a potential tax relief package.
The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

Michael Saylor’s Strategy purchased a fresh batch of Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency pushed above $100,000 last week.
Strategy acquired 13,390 Bitcoin (BTC) for $1.34 billion between May 5 and May 11, the firm announced in its filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission published on May 12.
The acquisition has increased Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings by 2.4% to a total of 568,840 BTC, acquired for about $39.4 billion at an average price of $69,287 per coin.

According to a May 12 announcement, Nakamoto Holdings — a new company founded by David Bailey, a crypto adviser to US President Donald Trump — plans to build the first global network of Bitcoin (BTC) treasury companies in partnership with BTC Inc. Bailey said:
“Traditional finance and Bitcoin-native markets are converging. The securitization of Bitcoin will redraw the world’s economic map. We believe a future is coming where every balance sheet – public or private – holds Bitcoin.”

Rohun Vora, known online as “Frank DeGods” on X, said he has stepped down as the project’s CEO, concluding a three-year stint as the head of one of the most popular Solana-based NFT collections. 
He identified pseudonymous figures 0x_chill and Pastagotsauce as the new leaders of DeGods. “There are no investigations, because I have never done anything illegal. That’s the boring truth,” Vora wrote, addressing speculation about his departure.  
The announcement came as the NFT collection started gaining traction on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

Backpack’s support page also said that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU:
“If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.”

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.

In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.
While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. 
At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. 
Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation an…</span>

                              <span>Goldman Sachs-backed cryptocurrency custody firm BitGo is the latest cryptocurrency company to secure regulatory approval to operate across the European Union.
Germany’s financial regulator, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), granted BitGo Europe a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) license to provide digital asset services in the EU, the firm announced on May 12.
The license allows BitGo to offer services to crypto-native firms and traditional finance institutions, including banks and asset managers within the EU.

Uniswap also has a current daily volume of $3.3 billion, according to Dune. DeFillama meanwhile shows Uniswap is the leading DEX with a 23% market share in daily volumes, which it reports as slightly lower at $3 billion over the past 24 hours. 
The second-largest DEX in volume is PancakeSwap, with $2.7 billion and a 21% DEX market share.

Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.

There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now.

                              <span>Bitcoin’s potential price reaction to a trade deal between the United States and China could give insights into whether Bitcoin is being used as a safe-haven asset in the current market. 
Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11.
Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April. 
At the time, people wondered if Bitcoin’s relative strength came from the narrative that countries were using Bitcoin to bypass tariffs. The analyst said the opposite should th…</span>

                              <span>Tinian, a small island in the US territory of the Northern Mariana Islands, could get a second chance at launching a stablecoin after the territory’s Senate voted to override the governor’s earlier veto of its stablecoin bill.
On May 9, the Northern Mariana Islands Senate voted 7-1 to override Governor Arnold Palacios&#x27; April 11 veto of the bill, which would allow the Tinian local government to issue licenses to internet casinos and includes a provision for the Tinian treasurer to issue, manage and redeem a “Tinian Stable Token.” 
The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.
If the House is quick to pass the bill, the Tinian government could be in the lead for the first US …</span>

                              <span>Censorship-resistant “dark stablecoins” could come in increasing demand as governments tighten their oversight of the industry. 
Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”

“One of our contracted moderators had their account compromised, which allowed a malicious bot to post scam links in one channel,” Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright wrote on the Ledger Discord server. 
“The issue was quickly contained: the compromised account was removed, the bot was deleted, the website was reported, and all relevant permissions were reviewed and secured.”
Some members in Ledger’s Discord channel claimed the attacker abused moderator privileges to ban and mute them as they tried to report the breach, possibly slowing Ledger’s reaction.…</span>

                              <span>Tech company Microsoft and artificial intelligence firm OpenAI are reportedly in talks to renegotiate the investment deal between the AI firm and Microsoft, which is OpenAI&#x27;s biggest financial backer.
According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company&#x27;s products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

According to members of the Lido DAO, an address belonging to the Chorus One oracle was compromised, and the Ether (ETH) balance associated with that oracle was drained in an incident still being investigated.
Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.
