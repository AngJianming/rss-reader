                              <span>After receiving JSON from RESTful services, further calculations are often required. Processing such data in Java is cumbersome. In contrast, esProc simplifies this significantly, as it can connect to RESTful interfaces, excels at processing multi-layered data, and can be embedded in Java applications as an in-application computing engine.
First, download esProc Standard Edition ，It&#x27;s free.
After installation, try accessing RESTful data.

                              <span>Hi, I want to focus on why you might be interested in learning Rust in this short article.
If you&#x27;re reading this, you may already be interested in learning Rust. However, if not, I understand you. I am also very skeptical about learning new technologies. But I am here to try to change your mind. 
Here are some reasons to consider it:
Performance: The main reason Rust has become popular is that it is designed to be fast and efficient. This makes it an excellent choice for performance-critical applications. It can often match (or exceed) the performance of C and C++ while providing additional safety features. I believe it strikes a good balance between performance and safety.


Memory Safety: Rust is designed to be memory-safe. This helps avoid common programming errors like null pointer de…</span>

Learning takes time, so I try to do it effectively.
4 things that help:
Chunk: Break down complex topics into manageable chunks
Do it regularly: Spacing out helps you with retention
Write about it: It forces you to understand it better
Get feedback: You will know if you are wrong fast
I am learning about Web3 Data. I will post here the things I learn in the following days.

VPS hosting provides dedicated resources, full root access, and scalability—making it ideal for developers, startups, and growing businesses that need speed without breaking the bank. In this post, we&#x27;ll explore why VPS Hosting is superior to shared or dedicated options and why Algowid VPS Hosting deserves your attention.
A Virtual Private Server (VPS) gives you isolated CPU, RAM, and storage, unlike shared hosting where resources are split among many users. When combined with a Linux OS like Ubuntu, CentOS, or Debian, you get full control over your environment, enabling you to:
Run custom stacks and applications.
Install development tools.

In the realm of parallel programming, ensuring that concurrent threads produce the correct results can be a significant challenge. This article addresses the issues you&#x27;ve encountered while implementing a concurrent version of a heat transfer simulation using pthreads in C. It appears you&#x27;ve already determined that your code functions correctly when run in a single-threaded context, indicating the heat transfer calculations themselves are accurate. However, your multi-threading implementation yields incorrect results, suggesting potential issues in your concurrency handling.

But here’s the kicker: what you’ve built is just a facade — a beautiful, interactive shell that anyone else could replicate in 15 minutes. It’s like building a cardboard castle: impressive at first glance, but not exactly livable.
So, how do you transition from a flashy UI to a real, value-delivering product?
Let’s dive into the three pillars with practical exmples that make the difference:
1. Define Your Target Audience and Their Problem
Who you’re building for.
2. BI: Not Just Business Intelligence — It’s Builder’s Intelligence!
What users are doing on your platform.

Watching our users sessions in posthog

                              <span>CloudFormation Basics


Introduction:
AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to model and provision your AWS resources in a declarative manner. Instead of manually creating each resource individually, you define your desired infrastructure as code in a template, and CloudFormation handles the creation, update, and deletion.  This simplifies infrastructure management, enabling automation and repeatability.
Prerequisites:
Before using CloudFormation, you&#x27;ll need an AWS account and basic familiarity with AWS services.  Understanding JSON or YAML is crucial, as these are the primary formats for CloudFormation templates.
Advantages:
Automation: Automate the creation and management of complex infrastructure.
Repeatability: Easily recreate environments consistently across different regio…</span>

                              <span>🔔 What’s New?
AWS has announced that AWS Code Pipeline now supports using AWS Secrets Manager inside Commands actions!
💡 Why It Matters
Before this update, developers often:
    Hardcoded secrets into buildspec.yml
    Stored sensitive values directly in environment variables
    Used workarounds to pull secrets via scripts
This was risky and error-prone.
Now, you can pass secrets securely and natively using Secrets Manager — no more secrets in plain text!
✅ Real-World Example: Use GitHub Token Securely
Imagine you need to clone a private GitHub repo inside your pipeline.
🔐 Step 1: Store the GitHub token in AWS Secrets Manager
Key: github-token
ARN: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123

⚙️ Step 2: Reference the secret in your Code Pipeline YAML
Actions:
  - Name: ClonePrivateRepo
    ActionTypeId:
      Category: Test
      Owner: AWS
      Provider: Commands
      Version: 1
    Configuration:
      Commands: |
        echo &quot;Cloning repo...&quot;
        git clone https://git:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git
      EnvironmentVariables:
        - Name: GITHUB_TOKEN
          Type: SecretsManager
          Value: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123


✅ Your GitHub token is injected securely as $GITHUB_TOKEN without ever being exposed.
📌 Key Benefits
    🔐 Improved security: No plaintext credentials in code
    ⚙️ Easier automation: Seamless secret injection in pipelines
    📉 Reduced risk: Centralized and managed secret lifecycle

                              <span>Following on from the previous post I decided to attempt to use protobuf rather than json to transmit the data between the producer and the consumers. The updated repo can be found [C# Image Resizer Using ZeroMQ and Protobuf].(https://github.com/deltastateonline/ImageProcessor/tree/Using-Protobuf)
I found this starting point on using protobuf in c# from Fast and efficient data serialisation with Protocol buffers (protobuf) in .NET.
The first step is to add the protobuf-net package then define a class for the Image data definition. This class definition is an exact duplicate of the original, but with the required protobuf annotations.
using ProtoBuf;

In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The firm said on X on May 9 that it was making the cryptocurrency available to more than 100 million customers, adding that “the movement is just beginning,” before signing off as “Steaktoshi.” 
The fast food chain initially hinted at accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in March when it posted “Should Steak ‘n Shake accept Bitcoin?” on social media. 
The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.” 
The firm has built momentum since then with Bitcoin-themed marketing, Tesla promotions, and visual hints on its social media feeds.
“The future is bright,” said the firm in April. Source: Stak…</span>

Through a $21.25 million issue of “0% Ordinary Bonds,”  all the “funds raised will be allocated to the purchase of Bitcoin,” the firm said in a May 9 statement. 
Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.
After its most recent May 9 board of directors meeting, the firm said it will issue a 14th Stock Acquisition Rights to EVO Fund, an investment management firm in the Cayman Islands, with a redemption date of Nov. 7.

                              <span>Ether surged 20% in the past 24 hours following the launch of the Pectra upgrade, with some crypto traders suggesting the growing number of ETH long positions could mark a “turning point” for the asset that has faced uncertain sentiment throughout most of 2025.
At the time of publication, Ether (ETH) is trading at $2,230, up 19.6% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%.

The surge followed the long-awaited Pectra Upgrade, which went live on May 7, introducing new wallet features, increased staking limits and scalability improvements to Ethereum.

Gaming and DeFi are both sitting on 21% dominance in April, judged by percentage of unique active wallets, while AI has climbed to 16%, up from the 11% recorded in the February report, data in DappRadar’s April industry report shows.
“As user interest in artificial intelligence tools grows across industries, AI-powered DApps are steadily carving out their place in the decentralized ecosystem,” DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said. 
“If this trend continues, AI could soon challenge the traditional dominance of DeFi and Gaming, signaling a new era in the DApp landscape.”

A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.
The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said.

The San Francisco Standard reporter George Kelly claimed on May 8 that he briefly spoke with Yu outside of his family’s two-story home, where the crypto influencer refused to discuss the suicide allegations and whether he had financially benefited from it. 
Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.
He was reportedly wearing a T-shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wire-rimmed glasses, possibly similar to the ones he had on while appearing to shoot himself to death during the livestream.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether&#x27;s USDt (USDT), Circle&#x27;s USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
&quot;Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

Whale accumulation continues, with the number of addresses holding 10,000+ XRP rising steadily on price dips.

XRP broke above a key falling wedge resistance, increasing the chances of a rally toward $2.80–$3.66.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). 
After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

                              <span>Missouri House Bill 594, a bill that would eliminate capital gains tax in the US state, has passed a vote in the state House of Representatives and now heads to Missouri Governor Mike Kehoe&#x27;s desk for signature.
According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

                              <span>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 price level for the first time since January, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment among investors.
Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.
