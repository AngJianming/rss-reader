                              <span>Accessibility, often abbreviated as a11y, ensures digital content and functionality are usable by people with disabilities — including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. It’s not an optional feature or a stretch goal. In many regions, it’s a legal requirement. Everywhere, it’s a core quality standard.
One in five people experience disability. If your app doesn’t support screen readers, keyboard navigation, or high contrast modes — it’s broken for millions.
Web accessibility refers to the design and development of websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can perceive, navigate, interact with, and contribute to the web.
Accessibility supports a broad range of user contexts:

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment). It’s a set of modern DevOps practices that help teams deliver software faster, safer, and more frequently by automating the build, test, and deployment process.
CI is all about merging code early and often. Developers push changes to the main branch multiple times a day. Each push triggers automated builds and tests, helping catch bugs and integration issues before they grow into bigger problems.
Benefits:
✅ Catch errors early

✅ Keep the codebase stable

✅ Make collaboration easier

PCF components enabled for Canvas Apps in your environment
This solution includes:
A PCF control for handling the file download


A Power Automate flow to retrieve and convert SharePoint files to Base64


A Canvas App that ties everything together

In this post, let’s explore how to implement enterprise-grade logging using Serilog in .NET — from basic setup to advanced features.
Why Serilog?
Multiple sinks (console, file, Seq, Elasticsearch, etc.)
Enrichers for contextual data
Asynchronous logging
Easy integration with ASP.NET Core
Getting Started
Install the required NuGet packages:
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.File

In Program.cs (for .NET 6+):
using Serilog;
Log.Logger &#x3D; new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    .WriteTo.File(&quot;logs/log-.txt&quot;, rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)

Leadership is the ability to guide, influence, and inspire others toward achieving common goals.  
  
Strong leadership is vital because it:  
Sets clear vision and direction for the team

Motivates and empowers individuals to perform at their best

Builds trust, cohesion, and a positive work environment

Drives innovation and change in dynamic markets

Ensures accountability and effective decision-making



  
Different theories explain how leaders behave and adapt. Key styles include:  
Autocratic  
Leader makes decisions unilaterally

Fast decisions, clear authority

Can stifle creativity and buy-in




Democratic  
Leader involves team in decision-making

Builds commitment and diverse ideas

May slow down urgent decisions




Laissez-Faire  
Leader provides freedom and resources, minimal direction

Encourages autonomy and innovation

Risk of role confusion and lack of coordination




Transactional  
Focus on exchanges: rewards for performance

Clear structure and expectations

Limited to short-term goals and routine tasks




Transformational  
Inspires and motivates through vision and passion

Drives change, fosters personal growth

Requires strong charisma and emotional intelligence




Servant  
Puts team’s needs first, emphasizes empathy

                              <span>Polymorphism—the ability to write functions whose behavior depends on the type and number of their arguments—is a feature of many modern programming languages.
In the C world, this concept is especially relevant to library writers or developers implementing the backend of a complex system: fellow programmers prefer a clean, consistent API over dozens or hundreds of closely related functions that differ only by name and signature.
Too often, APIs end up littered with near-identical functions such as:
result_type mixdown_integer_and_string(int x, char *y);
result_type mixdown_unsigned_integer_and_string(unsigned int x, char *y);
result_type mixdown_string_and_float(char *x, float *y);

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and Nvidia&#x27;s earnings cap risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency industry groups are urging the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue formal guidance on staking, citing continued regulatory uncertainty for Web3 infrastructure providers, according to Allison Muehr, head of staking policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation, a trade group.
Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period.

Trump Media will issue $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in convertible bonds, a type of asset that can be converted into equity at a later date. The size of the raise may change, the FT cited sources familiar with the matter as saying.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …</span>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…</span>

All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.
The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024.

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hyp…</span>

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …</span>

While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including US President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…</span>

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. 

A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300.

Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following a broader altcoin market rally that also saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000. 
Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL hit all-time highs above $300?

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. 
Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis.

US President Donald Trump has extended the deadline of a proposed 50% tariff on EU goods to July 9.

A temporary easing in trade tensions could help fuel Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price climbed back above $109,000 during the late trading hours on May 25, as traders responded to President Donald Trump’s decision to delay the implementation of tariffs on EU goods until July 9.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC rose by as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of $110,100 on May 26 from a low of $106,660 on May 25.

Over 70% of XRP’s realized cap was accumulated near recent highs, echoing previous market top patterns.

XRP’s active address count has plunged over 90% since March 2025, signaling reduced transactional demand.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

                              <span>A TikTok prankster who attended  Donald Trump’s dinner for the US president’s top memecoin holders said the three-course meal served was some of the “worst food” he’s eaten and that Trump’s speech at the event was “pretty much like bullshit.”
“It was the worst food I’ve ever had at a Trump golf course,” Nicholas Pinto told WIRED on May 23, while other attendees the outlet interviewed said that the meal was “OK, but not top-class.”
On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.
“The only good thing was bread and butter,” Pinto said, adding he left the venue still hungry.

                              <span>Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.
Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The New York-listed DDC Enterprise, also known as DayDayCook, said on May 23 that it bought 21 Bitcoin (BTC) in exchange for 254,333 shares in a deal valued at $2.28 million.
The company added it plans on buying another 79 BTC across two purchases in “the coming days” to bring its total Bitcoin stack to 100 BTC.
The buys are part of DDC’s plan announced on May 15 to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, with the goal of buying 500 BTC before the end of 2025.
DDC’s planned 5,000 BTC stack, if it held that much today, would land it just outside the top 10 public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, puttin…</span>
