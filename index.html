Garuda Linux, known for its eye-catching aesthetics and performance-optimized Arch-based distros, has introduced a new flavor to its lineup — Garuda Mokka. This new distribution is designed to strike a balance between a visually appealing, user-friendly experience and a robust toolkit geared toward developers. But what makes Garuda Mokka stand out in the crowded field of Linux distributions, and why should developers take notice?
What Is Garuda Mokka?


Garuda Mokka is a lightweight yet full-featured Linux distribution based on Arch Linux and developed by the Garuda Linux team. While Garuda already offers several editions (such as KDE Dr460nized, XFCE, GNOME, and more), Mokka carves its niche by blending:

Getting started ..
I wanted to build a graphically rich game—something super simple that anyone could pick up and play, anywhere, anytime. The kind of game that keeps you going without overcomplicating things.
So I decided to keep it basic and go with just HTML, CSS, and JS. Now the big question was: what exactly am I building?

                              <span>Why semi-columns


Before making a case for semicolon-less JavaScript, you must first understand why the majority of experienced developers will continue to reject automatic semicolon insertion (ASI). Why these seemingly experienced developers clutter their code and keystrokes.
In short semi-columns in JavaScript helps reduce the surface for bugs in poorly maintained code bases, and provides clearer intent to formatters such as prettier.
I spent a long time searching for reasons for and against JavaScript semi-columns. But almost all of the reasons against semi-columns were &quot;linting should catch semicolon-less errors&quot; and &quot;I can type at 100 words per minute, so if I omit a semi column, I can save 0.6 seconds per line&quot;, or the worst &quot;it looks better&quot;.

                              <span>Working on a large C# or .NET project where entities are getting tangled up?
I recently ran into this while dealing with a moderately complex app:

“Wait… what’s related to what again?”
So I created a small but powerful tool using MSAGL (Microsoft Automatic Graph Layout) — and turned it into a downloadable project that you can use right away.
🧰 What It Does
This toolkit lets you visualize relationships between entities in your application or domain model — like User, Post, Comment, etc. — using clean, auto-arranged graph diagrams.
Here&#x27;s what you get:
✅ A ready-to-run C# project using WinForms and MSAGL

✅ A sample visualization with Dummy Nodes

✅ JPG output of the graph

✅ Just open in Visual Studio and hit Run
I&#x27;ve packaged everything into a downloadable zip on Gumroad.
👉 Get the MSAGL Entity Visualizer Toolkit
You’ll get:
Full Visual Studio solution

Sample image output

Ready To Run Application 
Clean code you can tweak for your own entities
💡 Why I Made This
This started as a blog post explaining how to use MSAGL to visualize application structures. But devs might want a plug-and-play solution instead of starting from scratch.
Rather than leave it as just a code sample, I turned it into a micro-product. Simple. Useful. Done.
Inspired from my Blog post : https://simplifyyourday.blogspot.com/2023/07/Graph-visualization-using-MSAGL.html</span>

                              <span>Refactoring with Result and Custom Errors: Turning Panic-Prone Code into Recoverable Operations


Error handling is one of the less glamorous but absolutely essential aspects of software development. In Rust, where safety and robustness are paramount, mastering error handling is a rite of passage. If you&#x27;ve been sprinkling .unwrap() and .expect() in your code like it&#x27;s sugar on cereal, it&#x27;s time to take your skills to the next level. In this post, we&#x27;ll explore how to refactor panic-prone Rust code into clean, recoverable operations using Result and custom error types.
Whether you&#x27;re building a CLI tool, a backend service, or a game engine, proper error handling is key to creating reliable and maintainable software. By the end of this article, you&#x27;ll know how to replace those p…</span>

                              <span>Generative AI is transforming industries from law to the arts, but it comes with a critical flaw: hallucinations—outputs that sound plausible but are factually incorrect or entirely fabricated.
AI hallucinations occur when models generate content not grounded in reality. These errors can range from subtle math mistakes to completely made-up citations or facts. Even advanced models like GPT-4 can produce such inaccuracies, especially when dealing with complex or underrepresented topics.
Key causes include:
Training Data Gaps: AI learns from vast datasets that may contain errors or lack coverage.
Overconfidence: Models are designed to respond, even when unsure, often producing confident but incorrect answers.
Task Complexity: In fields like law or medicine, even small errors can have serious consequences.
Hallucinations undermine trust in AI. In high-stakes areas—healthcare, finance, legal—misleading outputs can lead to harmful decisions. Without verification, AI can spread misinformation and reinforce biases.
Better Training Data: More diverse and accurate datasets reduce the chance of errors.
Human Oversight: Experts reviewing AI outputs can catch mistakes before they cause harm.
Transparency: Clear documentation helps users understand model limitations and make informed decisions.
AI hallucinations are a real challenge, but not an insurmountable one. With better training, oversight, and transparency, we can build more reliable systems. Trust in AI should be earned—not assumed.</span>

Introduction
As a backend developer specialising in AI chatbots, I recently built a production-ready GenAI chatbot that demonstrates enterprise-level security, scalability, and user experience. This project showcases my ability to create full-stack solutions that clients can trust with their business communications.
You can see the live chatbot in action on my website - it&#x27;s the orange chatbot on the bottom right (I also have a non-GenAI chatbot for comparison - the purple icon on the bottom right).
The Challenge
I needed to create a secure, embeddable GenAI chatbot that could:
Handle multiple clients with proper authentication
Integrate seamlessly into any website
Provide intelligent responses using Google&#x27;s Gemini API
Maintain British English consistency…</span>

                              <span>What I’d change if I had to start my frontend journey over again.
Learning frontend development today is both exciting and overwhelming. There are countless tools, frameworks, and tutorials out there and it’s easy to get lost chasing everything.
I’ve been a frontend developer for 3 years now. I’ve built real projects, made real mistakes, and discovered what actually matters over time.
If I were starting from scratch today, here’s exactly what I’d do differently and what I’d focus on instead.
🎨 1. Learn UX While Learning Frontend
What I missed? User experience.
If you want to build good products, you need to understand:
How users interact with your UI
Spacing &amp; hierarchy
🔧 2. Choose One Framework and Go Deep
Spoiler: I learned none of them well.
If I could go back, I’d pick one probably React (again) and go deep:
Build multiple real projects with it
⚙️ 3. Don’t Skip the Core Fundamentals
How the DOM works
Vanilla JavaScript
🤖 4. Use AI as a Learning Assistant (Not a Shortcut)
If I were a beginner today, I’d use ChatGPT or Copilot to:
Explain code I don’t understand
🧠 5. Focus More on Projects, Not Just Tutorials
If I were learning again, I’d spend less time watching tutorials and more time building things:
A personal portfolio
✅ Final Thoughts
If I were learning frontend development in 2025, I’d:
Learn UX alongside code
📣 What About You?
And if you’ve been coding for a while, what’s your biggest “I wish I knew that earlier” moment?
