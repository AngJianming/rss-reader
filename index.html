But what makes India’s digital entertainment space truly unique is the rise of regional OTT platforms streaming services that offer content in regional languages, capturing the hearts of millions across the country.
From Bhojpuri to Bengali, Malayalam to Marathi, regional OTT platforms are not just filling a niche—they&#x27;re becoming mainstream. If you’re someone who loves content in your mother tongue or simply wants to explore the rich storytelling traditions of India’s various cultures, these platforms are worth checking out.

The trouble is that a lot of the features that these platforms have made famous like achievements, streaks and progress report emails can take weeks to build. This is why we built Trophy, to help developers build these gamification features much faster.
To demonstrate this I built an example web application that hypothetical students could use to practice flashcards. Feel free to use this example app to start a new ed-tech project, or just as inspiration.

                              <span>When Curiosity Strikes
It always starts cute.
You’re scrolling through LinkedIn, hear “AI is the future,” and suddenly your inner coder whispers:  
“Yeah, I’ll become an AI Engineer.”
You open a YouTube tutorial, start learning Python, maybe dabble in a little scikit-learn... and for a moment, you feel invincible.
Then Reality Hits
Boom — you meet:
Gradient Descent (why does it feel like I&#x27;m the one descending?)
Backpropagation (stabbed in the back... with math)
“CUDA not detected” (even though your GPU is flexing in Task Manager)
Transformers (not the Optimus Prime kind )
Your innocent coding dreams become haunted by tensors and traceback errors.
The Dev Setup, but Make it Chaotic
You build your workstation:
Dual monitors 
Fancy keyboard

RGB lights

Motivation? Fading...
Mentally? Still in a baby playpen. Crying quietly as your LSTM forgets what it just learned.
And Now You’re... Aged by 10 Years
You started at 20.

You debugged PyTorch for 3 nights.

You now look like a retired philosopher sipping black coffee at 3AM.  
“I just wanted to make a chatbot…”
But Here&#x27;s the Truth...
Every bug, every crash, every late-night meme scroll — it means you’re growing.
So laugh at the chaos. Embrace the madness.

Post the memes. Share the learnings.

And keep going.
Final Words
To anyone out there struggling with AI engineering:
You&#x27;re not failing. You&#x27;re just leveling up.
Keep the curiosity alive.

Keep coding.

And never stop memeing your journey.
Peace</span>

Security is hard. As developers, we’re not exactly great at it. The issue is that security is binary - it either works 100% or it doesn’t at all. If there’s a flaw in your code, an attacker could gain full access to your system. Worse, you can never truly prove that something is 100% secure. All you can do is try to prevent every possible way in, which requires a lot of experience and a lot of eyes on the code. The only thing that gets you closer to 100% is time and scrutiny.
That’s the key to secure code: experienced developers looking at it, lots of them, and enough time passing without a breach. We never know it’s secure. We can only hope.

                              <span>As developers, we often pride ourselves on clean code, scalable architecture, and efficient design. But what about the experience we’re building for the end user?
When it comes to enterprise software, there&#x27;s a less-discussed but equally important topic we need to address:
🕳️ Dark Patterns.
And yes, they show up in enterprise environments all the time. From subtle interface traps to forced onboarding steps, these patterns can damage trust, reduce adoption, and frustrate the very people we’re supposed to help.
Let’s break down the most common examples—and how we, as developers, can avoid falling into the trap.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m Choice 👋🏽
I’m a Ruby on Rails developer with a background in chemistry — but really, I’m someone who’s rebuilding life from the inside out.
My journey into tech wasn&#x27;t linear. Like many Nigerians, I studied something safe (Chemistry), even though I’d always loved computers. Life happened, and I took detours that forced me to pause, reflect, and reimagine everything. Coding became more than a skill; it became a language of healing, structure, and hope.
Since transitioning, I’ve built full-stack apps like ShopMe (e-commerce), DevConnect (developer community), and I’m currently working on TextMe, a real-time chat app. I’ve used tools like:
Ruby on Rails (8), SolidQueue for background jobs
AWS S3 for image storage
React, Firebase, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap
I’m also learning Django and Next.js 🌱
But beyond the tech, I’m creating soulful, user-centered projects — the kind that feel like quiet spaces on the internet. My content brand DearChoice is where I share faith, healing, and growth. My passion project Yardly aims to help communities in Nigeria discover local talents and preserve culture — online.
I want to connect with devs who are learning with heart. Who are figuring things out slowly. Who care about the why, not just the how.

If that sounds like you, let’s chat 🤝
Let’s build, share, reflect — and grow better together. ✨
🧩 You can check out my projects on GitHub @ChoiceG

💼 And find me on LinkedIn
See you around!

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. 
The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. 
VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with a long-awaited breakout from a narrow trading range around $103,000. 

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

Bitcoin exchange volume delta becomes a key ingredient in assessing the staying power of BTC price breakouts, per analysis from CryptoQuant.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.
What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader&#x27;s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. 
Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet…</span>

Metaplanet said on May 19 that it purchased 1,004 Bitcoin (BTC) for a total cost of around 15.2 billion yen ($104.6 million), bringing its total holdings to 7,800 Bitcoin worth around $807 million at current market prices.
It is the second-largest purchase the firm has made following its buy of 1,241 BTC for $129 million on May 12 in a move that pushed its Bitcoin holdings above that of El Salvador.
Metaplanet has the largest Bitcoin holdings of a public company in Asia and has the tenth largest holdings among public firms globally, according to BiTBO data.

At least six lawsuits were filed against Coinbase between May 15 and May 16, which all made various claims that the exchange failed to keep stringent security protocols to protect user data and handled the data breach aftermath poorly.
In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company.

Smerkis — who previously ran operations for Binance in Russia — is suspected of committing fraud on a “large scale,” pursuant to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, violations of which can result in imprisonment ranging from two to 12 years.
It isn’t clear if charges have been filed against Smerkis.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

Bitcoin notches record weekly close as it reaches back toward peak price
Bitcoin (BTC) notched its highest-ever weekly close at just below $106,500 on midnight UTC on Sunday, May 18, as the cryptocurrency is again nearing its all-time high.
Its last highest weekly close was in December when it reached $104,400. It later went on to reach an all-time high of $109,358 on Jan. 20, according to TradingView.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…</span>

Bitcoin is convincing traders that an upside breakout is around the corner, with all-time highs in sight.

One target demands $116,000 next week, moving BTC/USD firmly out of its narrow range.

A quick dip before continuing higher is among the options for BTC price action into the new week.

Bitcoin (BTC) reduced volatility to a minimum into the May 18 weekly close as traders bet on a fresh breakout.

                              <span>Economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, Saifedean Ammous, has weighed in on the ongoing debate over spam inscriptions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting he would “throw in a few sats” to fund a full-time developer focused on making Bitcoin spamming more difficult and expensive.
Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

                              <span>Retired artist Ed Suman lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency earlier this year after falling victim to a scam involving someone posing as a Coinbase support representative.
Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

The suspects allegedly recruited others to open bank accounts to receive proceeds from fraud cases, which were then converted into crypto at crypto exchange shops to launder the illicit funds, Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported on May 17.
The criminal organization rented a residential unit in the Hong Kong neighborhood of Mong Kok to plan and carry out its money laundering activities. Of the $15 million laundered, more than $1.2 million was linked to 58 re…</span>
