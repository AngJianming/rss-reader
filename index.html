In this article, we’ll explain what BIM is and break down the main benefits of using it in modern construction and infrastructure projects.
Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process that uses digital models to represent the physical and functional characteristics of a building or infrastructure. These models are much more than visual 3D representations. They contain detailed information and visualizations about every building element, including dimensions, materials, structural data, mechanical systems, cost estimates, timelines, and even maintenance schedules.

In modern classrooms, AI is not just a futuristic concept—it’s a practical tool that is already enhancing the way students learn and teachers teach. From personalized learning experiences to automated administrative tasks, AI is playing a significant role in shaping the future of education.
One of the most impactful uses of AI in education is personalized learning. AI-powered platforms can assess a student’s strengths, weaknesses, learning pace, and preferences. Based on this data, they can recommend customized study materials, exercises, and learning paths. This tailored approach helps students grasp concepts more effectively and keeps them engaged.

The Hiccup That Sparked a Journey
Like any curious dev, I asked why.
A quick search led me to the term memory fragmentation. What seemed like a minor partitioning issue turned out to be a deep concept rooted in how operating systems manage memory. This one error pushed me into a spiral of tutorials and docs. By the time I was done, I had unintentionally studied most of what an Operating Systems course would teach.
Key Concepts I Learned


1. 🧱 Memory Fragmentation
External fragmentation: Free space exists but not contiguously, so large partitions can’t be created.
Internal fragmentation: Wasted space inside allocated memory blocks.
I used defragmentation tools to try and reorganize data on the disk—leading me to explore file systems, ho…</span>

                              <span>Just wanted to share a quick behind-the-scenes look at https://podsy.ge/ — a platform built for exploring and learning about vape products in Georgia.
Unlike typical e-commerce sites, Podsy isn’t built for placing orders. Instead, it’s focused on helping users browse products, compare features, and understand what’s out there — especially useful for people who are just getting into vaping or looking to try something new.
Product Browsing Experience: We put a lot of thought into how users explore the site. Whether you&#x27;re looking for nicotine-free options or comparing different devices, the goal was to keep navigation clear and the information accessible.
Structured Content: Building out the content architecture was a big part of the project — organizing products, categories, and blog content in a way that makes sense even to someone new to the vape world.
Built for Exploration: The audience is mostly curious users, not experts, so we aimed to create a low-pressure environment where people can learn before they buy — even if the purchase happens elsewhere.
We’ve also started publishing blogs and are currently brainstorming new content ideas to make the platform even more useful for beginners and enthusiasts alike.
If you’re working on a product discovery platform — especially in a niche space — this was a fun reminder that not everything has to end in a checkout flow. Sometimes it’s about giving people the space to browse, read, and figure out what they actually want.</span>

The 17th series of bonds, issued on May 29, comes with a face value of $525,000 each and will mature on Nov. 28, 2025. Unlike traditional debt instruments, these bonds yield no interest, allowing Metaplanet to borrow without additional repayment costs.
Under the terms, Evo Fund is entitled to early redemption by giving at least five business days’ notice. The bonds can be redeemed in full or in part, in multiples of $525,000.

                              <span>Crypto lobby group the DeFi Education Fund and the Uniswap Foundation have said the Securities and Exchange Commission should be hands-off on regulating decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
The May 27 letter to SEC Crypto Task Force lead Hester Peirce argued that the agency should not treat DAOs under the purview of the securities-defining Howey test if they’re “sufficiently decentralized,” as they are not identifiable and are not a coordinated group.
Instead, the pair said DAOs should be treated as individuals or a group of persons unless proved otherwise. 
“If a DAO has a dispersed collection of tokenholders who have the opportunity to actively participate in and govern the DAO and the network, it is sufficiently decentralized such that neither the network token for that DAO, nor transactions in which that network token are the object, should be considered a security.” the letter read.
The letter was issued in response to Peirce’s Feb. 21 statement, which invited comments on crypto.
Favorable regulatory environment
The SEC has flipped on its crypto enforcement actions under the Trump administration, which successfully installed the former crypto lobbyist Paul Atkins to lead the agency.
Atkins has stated that blockchain technology could usher in new forms of market activity.

The following week, Atkins said that the regulator would not stifle innovation and lambasted the Biden administration’s approach to crypto.
In a May 20 SEC oversight hearing, Atkins confirmed that the Crypto Task Force’s first report will be released in the next few months, the group is also holding a series of crypto-related roundtable discussions with industry players.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Adams pledged to advocate for and support the creation of municipal bonds backed by Bitcoin (BTC).
“We have financial instruments for all other bonds. You can have tax-exempt bonds and other bonds. It is time for the first time in the history of this city to have a financial instrument that is made for those who are holders of Bitcoin,” he said.
“I believe we need to have a Bitbond, and I am going to push and fight to get a Bitbond in New York so you can do those same bond investments in New York City.”

                              <span>Bitcoin is poised to rally toward $120,000 after a US federal court blocked the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a crypto analyst says.
“The trade court decision was an epic mic drop, and it’s going to intensify momentum behind Bitcoin,” Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal told Cointelegraph. 
The US Court of International Trade reportedly blocked Trump from imposing his tariffs on May 28, arguing that he overstepped his authority.

Hundal said the decision would have a domino effect on Bitcoin’s price and believes “new all-time highs are imminent, and the momentum is largely irreversible at this stage.”

The strength of Bitcoin’s (BTC) run from $75,000 on April 7 to its all-time high just below $112,000 on May 22 “is starting to break down,” Woo wrote to X on May 28. 
“This week is absolutely critical,” he said. “If we do not get follow-through, then we will be up for another consolidation period.” 
Woo said that in the short term, “late comer speculators” are taking long positions while potential profit taking “is ready to dump” as seen in the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), which is a measure of the price paid divided by the price sold.

Warrants are zero-interest securities that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. K33 could purchase up to 57 Bitcoin (BTC) at BTC’s current price of just over $108,000.

                              <span>Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam has said the crypto market will remain unregulated unless the agency he led is given greater authority.
In a May 28 Bloomberg TV interview, Behnam sided with the crypto industry on its long-standing argument that cryptocurrencies are commodities.
“If you look at existing law, the few largest tokens are commodities, which means the SEC does not have jurisdiction over those tokens, which include Bitcoin and Ether,” he said. 
He added that the Securities and Exchange Commission currently cannot properly regulate crypto because its law doesn’t allow it to regulate commodities, and the CFTC cannot regulate because it is a derivatives regulator.

The crypto market remained unscathed, despite the stock drops among crypto miners.
Uncertainty about the economic outlook looms
The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on May 6 and 7, released on May 28, stated, “the Committee might face difficult tradeoffs if inflation proves to be more persistent while the outlooks for growth and employment weaken.” 
The Fed had decided after its meetings in early May to keep interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, with the minutes revealing the reason was due to “a further increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook and a rise in the risks of both h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Historical chart patterns and the Fibonacci Retracement metric hint at a Solana price rally to $300.

Solana’s $7.5 billion in futures open interest and negative funding rates could be a sign that a powerful short squeeze is in the making.

Solana (SOL) price tested the $180 resistance level on May 11, but it has since consolidated below this key threshold and appears unable to establish a sustained bullish position. However, the altcoin has maintained a positive signal by closing above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA) for three consecutive weeks. This critical level has historically acted as a catalyst for significant price rallies.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

97% of ETH put options will expire worthless if ETH holds above $2,600.

A bullish ETH price outcome could be limited by macroeconomic factors and trading strategies that cap Ether gains.

On May 30, $2.4 billion in Ether (ETH) options will expire—an event that could support ETH’s attempt to break above the $2,700 mark for the first time in over three months. Despite the recent gains, Ether is down 21% in 2025, while the broader cryptocurrency market has seen a 5% increase.
Ether bulls are motivated to keep ETH above $2,600 ahead of the monthly expiry. However, weak network activity on Ethereum suggests that the upside potential may be limited.

Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam said on May 28 that the crypto market will remain unregulated unless the agency he led is given greater authority.
Behnam argued in a Bloomberg TV interview that “the few largest tokens are commodities” and the Securities and Exchange Commission cannot properly regulate crypto because it can’t regulate commodities and the CFTC can’t regulate crypto because it is a derivatives regulator.

On May 28, the Labor Department revoked a 2022 guidance that had urged fiduciaries to be “extremely cautious” when considering cryptocurrency for 401(k) retirement plans. The move could give asset managers more flexibility to include digital assets in retirement investment options.
The government agency removed the guidance asserting that it represented a departure from the department’s “historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions.”

Bitcoin researcher Sminston With says BTC could gain 100% to 200%, with a cycle peak between $220,000 to $330,000.

Bitcoin continues to exhibit strong cyclical volatility, contradicting the belief that its price swings are softening over time.

Over $4 billion in BTC has been moved by long-term holders, warning of a price correction.

Analysis from Bitcoin (BTC) researcher Sminston With implied that a BTC price peak is still 100% to 200% away from current prices. In a recent X post, With shared a Bitcoin price chart using a 365-day simple moving average (SMA) aligned with a power law model (R²&#x3D;0.96). 
The model suggests Bitcoin’s price follows a predictable, non-random pattern over time, distinct from the exponential growth models often applied to stocks and equities.

Bitcoin’s market structure is still bullish, even as a phase of profit taking and consolidation sets in.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher.
Glassnode had a similar view. In its latest report, the market intelligence company said that the relative strength indicator (RSI) has weakened, suggesting easing momentum, which could lead to “a potential pause or reversal in the recent bullish trend.”

Conduit markets its payment system as an alternative to the messaging network SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications. Banks have relied on the SWIFT protocol to process wire transfers since the 1970s. 
Conduit claims its platform offers a modern alternative, enabling near real-time cross-border settlements by combining stablecoins with local fiat currencies through crypto infrastructure.

                              <span>BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. 
A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 20…</span>

Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …</span>

Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.
