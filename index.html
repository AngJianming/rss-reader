Now, let&#x27;s introduce user interactions through functions and event listeners, enabling dynamic task addition directly through user input. But to do that we need to learn couple of interesting javascript concepts.
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help reduce repetition and improve readability by breaking complex operations into steps, also making code easier to debug and maintain.
Function Declaration:
These are the most common type of functions. They are defined using the function keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body.

                              <span>Real-time systems are those that must adhere to strict timing constraints, ensuring tasks complete their operations within predetermined deadlines. In domains such as automotive control, industrial automation, robotics, and aerospace, microcontrollers often operate under these real-time requirements. When engineers design software for these constrained environments, many issues surface that do not commonly arise in desktop-level or cloud-computing applications. One particularly critical challenge revolves around dynamic memory allocation.  
Dynamic memory allocation involves requesting memory from a central resource (the heap) at runtime, rather than at compile time. In a desktop environment, this process might be handled by a sophisticated operating system or runtime library with mechanis…</span>

                              <span>State management in React has evolved dramatically. Gone are the days when Redux was your only choice for complex applications. Today&#x27;s atomic state management libraries offer fine-grained reactivity, minimal boilerplate, and better performance. But which one should you choose?
Traditional state management forces entire components to re-render when any part of the state changes. Atomic state management flips this approach - only components subscribed to specific pieces of state update when those pieces change.
This granular approach offers several key benefits:
Performance: Eliminates unnecessary re-renders
Simplicity: No complex provider trees or reducer boilerplate
Scalability: Independent state atoms that don&#x27;t interfere with each other

read-only volumes - isn&#x27;t this revolutionary?
Say goodbye to the old way of &quot;cramming everything into one container&quot;, and hello to:
Application code
Runtime
Libraries
...all split into separate images and mounted independently!
This is especially powerful for scripting language users (Node.js/Python/etc.)!
node:22.15.1.
The beauty of Image Volume is creating ultra-lightweight OCI images containing only code and config files.
index.js – The App




const http &#x3D; require(&#x27;http&#x27;);
http.createServer((_, res) &#x3D;&gt; res.end(&#x27;Hello from OCI volume!\n&#x27;))
    .listen(process.env.PORT || 80);

A simple HTTP server in Node.js that returns &quot;Hello from OCI volume!&quot;

If you&#x27;re building a React app and want to support multiple languages, using a localization library like Tolgee can make your life much easier. In this post, I’ll walk you through how to add Tolgee to a React project using the App Router (Next.js 13+), support multiple languages, and even set up a language switcher.


  
  
  🔧 What is Tolgee?


Tolgee is a modern i18n (internationalization) tool for web apps. It supports in-context translation, works well with TypeScript, and integrates nicely with React. It’s like i18next, but a bit easier to set up and manage—especially with its cloud UI.


  
  
  🛠️ Getting Started


Let’s start by installing the required packages.
npm install @tolgee/react tolgee

Create a file called tolgee.ts in your lib folder…</span>

                              <span>In this project, I built a basic static file server using Node.js. The server listens on port 3000 and serves HTML, CSS, JS, and PNG files from the project directory. It uses Node&#x27;s built-in http, fs, and path modules to handle requests and serve files with the correct MIME types. If a requested file is not found, the server responds with a custom 404 message.
This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand how to serve static files with Node.js without any external frameworks. The main purpose of this project is to teach and to demonstrate the capabilities of nodeJS.

                              <span>🔰 什麼是 WAF？


WAF 全名為 Web Application Firewall（網站應用程式防火牆），是一種專門針對 Web 應用程式層級（第七層）的資安防護機制。

它不像傳統防火牆只檢查 IP、Port、協定，而是能深入檢查 HTTP/HTTPS 請求的內容，防範駭客常用的攻擊手法。



攻擊類型
說明




SQL Injection
透過注入惡意 SQL 查詢操控資料庫，例如 1&#x27; OR 1&#x3D;1--



Cross-Site Scripting（XSS）
嵌入惡意 JavaScript，例如 alert(123)



Cross-Site Request Forgery（CSRF）
偽造使用者請求執行操作，例如偷偷發送刪除帳號請求


Command Injection
注入 OS 指令，例如 ; rm -rf /



File Inclusion（LFI/RFI）
引入惡意程式碼檔案執行


HTTP Flood、DoS 攻擊
短時間大量請求癱瘓網站服務



WAF 通常會部署在 Web Server 之前，扮演流量的代理者，外部訪客的流量會先進到 WAF，再由 WAF 轉發至內部伺服器。
[Client]
   ↓
[WAF ← 對外開放 IP/Port]
   ↓
[Web Server（VM）]




功能
說明




請求內容過濾
攔截包含惡意 Payload 的參數、Header、Body


IP 控制
封鎖特定來源 IP 或設白名單


負載平衡
部分 WAF 可做多台主機流量分配


日誌與警報
記錄可疑請求與阻擋記錄，供後續分析


SSL 終止
可在 WAF 處理 SSL 解密，減少後端負擔


行為學習
進階 WAF 有 AI 模型可自動學習並預測異常行為（如 Cloudflare Bot 管理）






類型
代表產品




雲端型
Cloudflare WAF、AWS WAF、Azure WAF、Imperva


軟體型
ModSecurity（支援 Apache/Nginx）、NAXSI


硬體型
F5 BIG-IP ASM、Fortinet FortiWeb、Palo Alto WAF



保護購物網站避免被植入惡意腳本、SQL 注入造成資料外洩。
強制部署資安設備防止駭客攻擊網站介面。
攔截非法 API 存取請求，避免敏感資料被未授權使用。
保護多租戶環境中的各個客戶資料，避免跨站操作。
你可以用以下技術製作一套基本的 WAF：
使用 Nginx + Lua（OpenResty）做請求過濾
在 ASP.NET Core / Django / Node.js 寫 Middleware 分析請求內容
使用 Regex 或字串比對過濾常見攻擊字樣
加入封鎖機制與黑名單功能
📌 建議參考 OWASP CRS（Core Rule Set） 當作 WAF 規則庫基礎
WAF 是現代網站不可或缺的資安防線。隨著 Web 應用日益複雜，攻擊手法層出不窮，WAF 能有效減少漏洞被濫用的機率。

不論是商業網站、API 系統、或是內部平台，只要有對外服務，都建議部署 WAF 來保障系統與資料安全。</span>

I was drinking lassi.
Wikipedia.
Whatever, I was drinking lassi and scrolling through YouTube, when I stumbled upon this video by Mr.PiwPiew.
After completing the video, I looked through the comment section, and then I came here to write this blog.
The top comment was made by @NFvidoJagg2. It was
HTML is not a programming language, it&#x27;s an XML based markup language used to build webpages.
I can&#x27;t describe how shocked I was at that time. All the time I didn&#x27;t knew HTML isn&#x27;t a programming language
Now you can call me dumb, but in the end I found out that it&#x27;s not a programming language and now I am here to help those who still consider it as a programming language.
First, if you already knew the full form of HTML, I am 60% sure you also know it&#x27;s not a programming language, b…</span>

                              <span>AI was supposed to make development easier.
What we’re left with is half-understood code, test coverage duct-taped together, and developers trusting output they didn’t write, don’t own, and can’t fully explain.
So now we’re here:
Here’s how we got here—and what nobody’s saying out loud.
🧠 Prompt Engineering Isn’t Engineering
Prompt engineering sounds smart—until you realize it’s just creative Googling with better grammar.
We wrote about why the term “engineering” doesn’t belong here. Because if your process breaks when phrasing changes, it’s not engineering. It’s trial-and-error with a marketing spin.
🔀 AI vs Traditional Coding Isn’t the Right Debate
People love debating whether AI will replace traditional coders.
Traditional coding builds muscle memory. AI coding builds dependency.
🧨 We’re Creating Technical Debt Faster Than Ever
The more you rely on AI, the less you review what it does.
This isn’t a rant—it’s a warning.
By the time you’re fixing it, the damage is already deployed.
🧟‍♂️ And Now It’s Writing SEO Content Too...
It’s not just code. AI is now pumping out articles that say nothing—but rank anyway.
And just like bad code, bad content piles up until the signal gets buried.
AI’s not the problem.
We’ll keep debugging, rewriting, and firefighting until we treat AI as a tool, not a shortcut.
You just swapped one problem for another.
