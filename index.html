  🚀 What I Built


I built an Automated PR Review Helper, a command-line tool that streamlines the pull request review process. This tool automatically:
Fetches open pull requests from a selected GitHub repository
Runs static analysis on code changes using Amazon Q Developer


Generates a summary highlighting:
Risky or complex code blocks
Suggested refactors
Security or performance issues
Posts these insights as automated comments on the pull request




This eliminates the need for manual code review in early stages, helping teams ship code faster and more confidently.

You can also check out a short video walkthrough here:
YouTube Demo Video
🔗 GitHub Repository - Automated PR Review Helper
Feel free to explore, clone, and run the CLI tool locally. Detailed setup instructions are provided in the README.md.

  🧠 How I Used Amazon Q Developer


Amazon Q Developer was a core part of this solution. I used it to:
Analyze pull request diffs and modified code sections
Identify code smells, complexity, and refactoring suggestions
Generate AI-powered summaries and comments for developers
The Q CLI helped integrate this analysis directly in the terminal, which I then automated into the review workflow.

                              <span>Introduction
Scheduling local notifications in an Ionic 3 application can be a useful feature, particularly for reminding users about important events or tasks. You’ve already implemented basic local notifications, but now you want to enhance your functionality by sending a notification every day at a specific time. In this article, we will delve into how you can set up daily local notifications using Ionic 3&#x27;s local notification plugin.
Understanding Ionic Local Notifications
The Ionic local notification plugin allows developers to schedule notifications at specific times. This plugin is lightweight and perfect for reminders that do not require internet connectivity, unlike push notifications. As you&#x27;ve experienced, it works seamlessly for daily reminders that need to be shown to the user…</span>

                              <span>This is a submission for the Amazon Q Developer &quot;Quack The Code&quot; Challenge: That&#x27;s Entertainment!
SceneCraft is an AI-powered storytelling experience that turns a short text prompt into a full sensory adventure. It generates a complete short story using Amazon Bedrock, breaks the story into scenes, and brings each one to life with:
Illustrations per scene (via generative image models)


Narrated voiceover using Amazon Polly


Emotion-based background music to match each scene’s mood


Scene-by-scene rendering in a cinematic layout



The experience feels like a lightweight, animated audiobook — making it fun for both kids and adults. You give it just a sentence, and in return, you get an immersive, narrated story complete with visuals and sound.
It’s designed to feel magical, yet it&#x27;s entirely powered by AWS-native AI services.

🔗 GitHub Repository
I used Amazon Q Developer inside the AWS Console and VS Code extension to:
Scaffold AWS SDK usage quickly
Generate boilerplate for Bedrock and Polly integration
Debug tricky payload formats for Claude and image models
Speed up Lambda function setup and S3 interactions
Amazon Q helped accelerate development, especially during early exploration of the Bedrock APIs and troubleshooting parameter configurations.
While this submission didn’t use Q Apps directly, it showcases what developers can build using AWS-native AI services — with Amazon Q Developer acting as the copilot behind the scenes.</span>

                              <span>When scripting in Bash, it&#x27;s common to want to exit a script gracefully when an operation fails. This is essential for ensuring that your script does not continue to run in an erroneous state. In this article, we’ll explore how to exit a Bash script with a custom error message and discuss some common pitfalls that may arise in the process.
Understanding the Basics of Exit Codes in Bash
Bash scripts use exit codes to indicate completion status. A successful command returns an exit code of 0, while a failure returns a non-zero exit code. You can capture this behavior using conditional statements. For example, command || echo &#x27;Error message&#x27; will output the error message if the command fails.

Enter Jenkins, the granddaddy of CI/CD tools. It’s here to automate the boring stuff so you can focus on what matters: building awesome things. But let’s be real—Jenkins can feel intimidating at first. Declarative? Scripted? What’s the difference?  
Don’t sweat it! By the end of this guide, you’ll have your first pipeline up and running, and you’ll finally understand which syntax to use (and when). Let’s dive in!  
What’s a Jenkins Pipeline?

However, if you encounter behavior where the output from your module&#x27;s destructor is displayed before the constructor&#x27;s output in the system log, it can be perplexing. In this article, we will explore the likely reasons behind this order and provide some insights into how Linux kernel modules operate.
Understanding Linux Kernel Modules and Their Lifecycle
Before jumping to the issue, let&#x27;s briefly cover how modules are structured and their lifecycle events. A kernel module goes through the following phases:

Welcome back to my second weekly dev log where I document what I’ve been learning and building on my journey into game development.
I’ve been making my way through Unity Learn’s Junior Programmer Pathway, and this week I wrapped up Chapter 3: Sound and Effects. It was a really fun chapter that helped me understand how much sound and visual feedback can enhance the feel of a game — even a simple one.
The first task was to build a fast-paced endless runner. The player has to jump over obstacles while the world scrolls by. Here’s what I tackled in this project:
Built a looping background to create a seamless side-scrolling effect

Added animations for running, jumping, and falling

Integrated particle effects for jumps and collisions

Implemented background music and sound effects …</span>

According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company&#x27;s products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

According to members of the Lido DAO, an address belonging to the Chorus One oracle was compromised, and the Ether (ETH) balance associated with that oracle was drained in an incident still being investigated.
Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

                              <span>Crypto services platform Nexo shared its plans to reenter the United States market on Monday, marking the eighth major crypto firm to announce such plans since US President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year.
Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”

                              <span>Worldcoin’s latest hardware, the Orb Mini, aimed at enabling portable human verification, has been met with ridicule across Crypto Twitter.
Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

The attacker deployed the contract from address 0xb32a53... at 07:31:38 UTC and initiated the exploit at 07:33:56 UTC, draining funds from the victim wallet 0xb5252f...
Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

                              <span>Altcoin markets are flashing early signs of a breakout, with several analysts calling for a potential surge over the next few months.
Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…</span>

Armstrong said the Bitcoin (BTC) strategy could have risked the company’s cash position and potentially killed the crypto exchange. “We made a conscious choice about risk,” he added.

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the &quot;loss of chance&quot; claim made against Binance for delisting the token, should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages, in the original case.
The investors continue to claim that Binance&#x27;s 2019 delisting of BSV and similar major exchange delistings are the primary drivers of BSV&#x27;s long-term price decline and its failure to attract the investor atte…</span>

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…</span>

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

Over the past trading week alone, IBIT posted $1.03 billion in inflows, according to Farside data.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.
