                              <span>A trio of major Abu Dhabi institutions, including the Emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, have teamed up to launch a new dirham-pegged stablecoin.
Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates&#x27; largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

The OCCRP reported on April 28, citing leaked company records and bank statements, that nearly half of the funds from Bankera’s 100 million euro ($114 million) ICO were transferred to a bank in the Pacific Island country of Vanuatu that was purchased by the project’s founders, Vytautas Karalevičius, Justas Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius.

As part of the experiment, AI-powered accounts faked a variety of personas, including a rape victim, a person opposed to specific social movements and a trauma counselor specializing in abuse, moderators of the r/changemyview subreddit said in an April 26 post.
“Our sub is a decidedly human space that rejects undisclosed AI as a core value,” the moderators said. “People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon.”

Lawyers for Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill said in an April 28 letter to Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman that they jointly requested with the government “for a continuance of the pretrial motions schedule by 16 days.”
The Samourai executives&#x27; lawyers said on April 10 that they wrote to Acting Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton to request the dismissal of the case after an April 7 memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche shuttered the Justice Department’s crypto team.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while USD-backed stablecoins may currently dominate, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins. He said: 
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space. The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it&#x27;s not currencies. It&#x27;s other types of backing.”
Collins said that these other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

The trade tensions are fracturing the monetary, political and international world orders by fueling deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, Dalio, the former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in an April 28 X post.
Dalio added that this is leading to irreversible damage, and an increasing number of importers and exporters, particularly between the US and China, are drastically reducing interdependencies and “making alternative plans.”

In an April 28 letter to White House crypto czar David Sacks, the group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice&#x27;s lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.” 
The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins, regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28.
The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them.
He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use …</span>

The board will act as the “security council to protect the heart and soul” of the foundation and set visions for Ethereum, while the new management will be focused on the strategic and operational execution of those visions, the Foundation said in an April 28 blog post.
It added in an April 28 X post that Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were appointed as co-executive directors on March 2 to deliver on those visions — which are centered around championing censorship resistance, open-source innovation, privacy and security

Whether you are a student, a developer, or an automation enthusiast, having access to a Python compiler is essential. But with the rise of browser-based tools, the question arises: should you use an online Python compiler or stick to a traditional desktop IDE?
Both options have their strengths and drawbacks. In this article, we’ll explore the differences between the two and help you decide which one suits your needs best.
An online Python compiler is a web-based tool that allows users to write, compile, and execute Python code directly in their browser. These tools require no installation or setup and often come with a minimalistic interface focused purely on writing and testing code q…</span>

Hey there, fellow code wranglers and AI enthusiasts! Remember when running a language model meant renting out half of AWS and selling a kidney? Well, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage because those days are gone. We&#x27;re diving into the wonderful world of open-source LLMs you can run on your trusty local machine. No cloud required, pants optional.
Before we jump into our list, let&#x27;s talk about why you&#x27;d want to run an LLM locally:
Privacy: Your conversations stay between you and your computer. No eavesdropping clouds here!
Offline access: Internet down? No problem. Your AI buddy is always there for you.
Customization: Tweak and train to your heart&#x27;s content. Make an LLM that truly gets your obscure Star Trek references.

                              <span>How to Structure a Fullstack App (Without Making a Complete Mess)
Most beginners think building fullstack is just:
✅ Frontend folder
Then a few weeks later...
The frontend can’t talk to the backend properly
APIs are a spaghetti mess
Environment variables are leaking
You don’t even remember where you put your models 😵‍💫
STRUCTURE MATTERS.
If you can&#x27;t find your own files, imagine what a recruiter or a senior dev will think looking at your repo.
Here’s how to actually set up your fullstack app like a pro 👇🏽
Step 1: Organize Your Frontend
✅ /components: Reusable UI pieces (buttons, forms, cards)
Bonus tip:
Step 2: Structure Your Backend
✅ /controllers: Logic for what happens when routes are hit (what to send, how to respond)
And yes:
Step 3: Connect Them Properly
🧠 Quick Mental Model:
If your app is a body, and the APIs are broken, the brain and the face are just screaming into the void. 😭
📌 SOOOO:
✅ Keep frontend and backend cleanly separated
✅ Use folders with real purpose, not random dumping grounds
✅ Name your files and routes clearly like getUser.js is better than stuff.js
✅ Connect through APIs with clear endpoints and error handling
✅ Deploy smart: Frontend + Backend + Database &#x3D; working ecosystem</span>

Here’s how to stream AWS Lambda logs directly to a browser UI in real time, without CloudWatch. We’ll use Kinesis, Lambda destinations, and a simple WebSocket server to build a powerful, cost-effective logging pipeline.
Kinesis Firehose is the simplest way to buffer log messages and route them downstream.
In the AWS Console:
Go to Kinesis → Firehose → Create Delivery Stream

Choose Direct PUT

Select destination: Amazon S3, or just Discard records for dev/testing
Name it lambda-logs-firehose



Take note of the stream name.
Instead of writing to console.log, use the AWS SDK to put logs into Firehose.

 Install python3 git depot\_tools Visual Studio 2017Windows 10 SDK&#x60; (required for non-Googlers only). Make sure to install the “Debugging Tools for Windows” feature.
 git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git

 cd flutter

 git remote rename origin upstream

 Fork flutter and change the origin to your fork: git remote add origin git@github.com:\/flutter.git

 Add flutter/bin to PATH.

make sure flutter is in your PATH where.exe flutter you&#x27;d might need to restart your terminal

 Add these to your env vars:


DEPOT_TOOLS_WIN_TOOLCHAIN&#x3D;0
GYP_MSVS_OVERRIDE_PATH&#x3D;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community (make sure the path is correct)
 cd flutter/engine
 cp .\scripts\standard.gclient .gclient

 Flutter has a tool for building the engine called et. Add it to PATH: C:\Users\temp\Desktop\flutter\engine\src\flutter\bin

 cd into flutter/engine and run et build to build the engine. (make sure et is in your PATH)
 Go make some ☕️ 🕐
 In the mean time, you can configure your VS Code C++ LSP. I suggest that you first disable Dart and Flutter extensions in order to avoid them running commands you don’t want.
 What should be done is:


 Open Code in flutter/engine and make sure you have the ms-vscode.cpptools extension installed.
 Configure VS Code to use compile_commands.json, which should be in C:\Users\temp\Desktop\flutter\engine\src\out\host_debug.

After several years et build should finish successfully, if not, don&#x27;t start making changes you&#x27;d regret that later.
Implement your patches and create a PR on Flutter.
Remember that Flutter&#x27;s team requires signed commits…
___
### Running Flutter projects with your custom engine
as per flutter docs on GH you should use et run inside your project (as if it was flutter run ) although for some reason it didn&#x27;t worked for me, so I instead ran the et tool directly like so

                              <span>Most devs reach for Cloudinary, Squoosh CLI, or a Node backend to optimize images.
But what if you could do production-grade image compression — including WebP and MozJPEG — directly in the browser, using WebAssembly? No server, no upload, no cost.
Here’s how to build your own browser-based image optimizer using WebAssembly and wasm-bindgen.
Google’s Squoosh project exposes production-ready WASM image codecs like MozJPEG, WebP, and AVIF — and you can use them in your own app.
Install the core codecs:
npm install @squoosh/lib
Then load a codec like MozJPEG:
import { ImagePool } from &#x27;@squoosh/lib&#x27;;

const imagePool &#x3D; new ImagePool();

Set up an input to handle image uploads:

                              <span>Most developers think you must pay for AWS EventBridge Scheduler or CloudWatch Events to run cron jobs on AWS Lambda.

But there&#x27;s a clever way to deploy completely free, production-grade cron jobs using only AWS services you already have access to.
Here&#x27;s how.
You don&#x27;t need &quot;Scheduler&quot; (which is a paid service). The free-tier &quot;EventBridge Rules&quot; can trigger Lambdas on a cron schedule.
Go to AWS Console → EventBridge → Rules → Create Rule.
Set up:
Rule Type: Schedule
Schedule Expression: Use cron syntax


Example: cron(0 9 * * ? *) — runs daily at 9:00 AM UTC
Then set the Target to your Lambda function.
Prefer IaC? Here&#x27;s how to create it with AWS CLI:
aws events put-rule \
  --name &quot;DailyJobRule&quot; \
  --schedule-expression &quot;cron(0 9 * * ? *)&quot; \
  --state ENABLED

And set the permission so…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin gained 10% over the past week, but overhead resistance continues to obstruct a rally to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below.

Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst
The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.

                              <span>Wallet provider MetaMask is launching a crypto payments card that will allow users to spend self-custodied funds, offering crypto holders additional ways to use their tokens.
The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum.
The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion, an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space.

                              <span>Today in crypto, a crypto group petitioned the White House to drop charges against crypto devs, including Tornado Cash’s Roman Storm, Arizona’s House passed two crypto reserve bills, and Coinbase launched a Bitcoin Yield Fund for institutional investors.
Crypto group asks Trump to end prosecution of crypto devs
The DeFi Education Fund has led an April 28 petition to White House crypto czar David Sacks asking to end what it claimed was the “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers, including Roman Storm, a creator of the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
The group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice&#x27;s lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.”

                              <span>Despite growing competition from emerging issuers, the stablecoin market remains largely dominated by a few key players. According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt (USDT) continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies.
As of April 25, Tether has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC (USDC), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. 
Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. 
“With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said.

                              <span>Lawmakers in the Arizona House of Representatives passed two bills that could allow the state to adopt a reserve using Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies.
In a third reading on April 28 of Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay.
“This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025.

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

A week full of US macroeconomic reports could impact Bitcoin traders’ sentiment. 

Bitcoin’s rally could stall if there’s a sharp reduction in spot buy volumes.

If PCE, the ISM PMI, and jobs data align with market expectations, BTC could rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price could face a period of range-bound trading after managing a 10.37% rally over the past 7 days. Robust spot purchasing demand from Strategy, the spot BTC ETFs, and announcements from 21Shares and Coinbase played a role in Bitcoin’s rally to $95,700. With the exception of the April 28 announcement of a $1.42 billion BTC purchase from Strategy, a quiet week on the crypto news front could translate to a reduction in spot demand and lower support tests from Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin’s year-over-year return and realized price metric signal strong long-term support from holders and suggest that BTC is currently undervalued.

 Standard Chartered estimates a Bitcoin price target in the $110,000–$120,000 zone by Q2 2025.

Positive funding rates point to a potential long squeeze to $90,500.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly close near $94,000 delivered an impressive year-over-year total return of 53.61%. Since the last halving in 2024, the market has shifted from the early 2024 euphoric phase to a &quot;mature bull trend&quot; based on onchain growth, rather than speculative frenzy.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin continues to face resistance at $95,000, but the possibility of an upside breakout remains high.

Solid spot Bitcoin ETF inflows do not always signal a short-term top.

Select altcoins are showing early signs of a short-term trend change.

Bitcoin (BTC) pierced the $95,000 resistance on April 28, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are trying to defend the level. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a move toward $100,000.
Another positive is that institutional demand seems to be back, as seen from the solid $3.06 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week. Although some instanc…</span>

US Treasury funds saw $19 billion inflows, the highest since March 2023, as the 30-year yield fell 30 basis points.

Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%.

Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. 

The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion — the highest since March 2023.

The exploiter pilfered approximately 5.7 million USDC (USDC) and 1,200 Solana (SOL) tokens from two of Loopscale’s yield vaults on April 26, prompting the decentralized finance protocol to temporarily pause its lending markets. 
The following day, the hacker sent a message on the Etherscan blockchain scanner “indicat[ing] a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty,” Loopscale said in an April 27 X post. 
“We are agreeable to collaborating with you to reach a white hat agreement. However, we would like to negotiate the bounty percentage; our expectation is 20%,” the hacker said. “To demonstrate our commitment …</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin price dropped alongside falling Treasury yields, signaling investors’ flight to safer assets.

Strategy’s $4.28B Bitcoin purchases and stock market strength have supported BTC above $90,000.

A true breakout toward $100,000 will require Bitcoin to decouple from equities and stronger liquidity signals.

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp $2,000 correction to $93,500 on April 28. This price movement closely tracked the decline in US Treasury yields, suggesting that traders were seeking the relative safety of more secure assets.
While Bitcoin traders are moderately satisfied with the 6% gains achieved over the past week, there is ongoing uncertainty as to why BTC has been unable to maintain levels above $95,000.

Altcoins have lagged Bitcoin year-to-date, but BNB price shows relative resilience, trading only 10% lower than the previous cycle’s all-time high.

BNB Chain shows a robust activity, consistently ranking third in daily transactions, active addresses, and TVL, while leading in the number of DApps.

The blockchain’s weakest point is its revenue, which still lags compared to competitors.

Altcoin price action has been underwhelming for much of the 2023-2026 cycle, pushing many crypto traders to focus primarily on Bitcoin. However, with moderate optimism returning to the markets, a closer look reveals that not all altcoins are struggling. In fact, the total altcoin market cap remains solidly above $1 trillion — $1.17 trillion, to be exact — and its 9% surge over the past week o…</span>

Blockchains were designed as systems of trust that are transparent, decentralized and accessible. The age of AI has, however, introduced significant new challenges. Nearly half of all internet traffic is generated by bots, with up to 80% of blockchain transactions now automated and AI agents accounting for most onchain activity. 
While some bots serve legitimate and helpful purposes, others — like those used for airdrop farming and fake account creation — clog networks, drive up fees, and monopolize space and resources.

Ethereum’s Fusaka hard fork is expected to take place in the third or fourth quarter of this year, according to an Ethereum Foundation official.
In an April 28 X post, Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak said that the organization is aiming to deploy the Fusaka Ethereum network upgrade in Q3 or Q4 2025. Still, the exact rollout schedule has not been decided yet.
Stańczak said a controversial implementation of the EVM object format (EOF) upgrade for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was expected to be a part of the Fusaka network upgrade, which Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko later ruled out.
