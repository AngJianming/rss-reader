In just under two weeks, the community built browser extensions, tools for automating safe dependency upgrades, Kubernetes companions, games about HTTP codes, and so much more! The judges were thrilled to see such a huge variety of high quality submissions across our three challenge prompts.
This was a highly competitive challenge and whether or not you win, we hope you’re proud of what you accomplished.
Now, let’s introduce our winners.

And you know what? It’s pretty damn good at it.
So if your job revolves around glueing together APIs you barely understand, copying code from StackOverflow or ChatGPT, and pushing commits without knowing what your code even does — well, I’ve got bad news for you: you&#x27;re replaceable.
But that doesn’t mean you should panic. It means you should grow.
Let AI handle the repetitive, mechanical stuff:
Writing CRUD endpoints? Automate it.
Refactoring a giant switch statement? Let it do its thing.
Generating types and test stubs? AI is faster and probably more accur…</span>

I built a Real-Time Resume Tailoring Agent — an AI-powered tool that helps job seekers instantly tailor their resumes to job descriptions they provide.
Users simply paste in a job description, and the AI intelligently rewrites and structures their resume to match the role — highlighting relevant experience, skills, and keywords.
It eliminates the manual, time-consuming process of editing resumes for every application and ensures job seekers are presenting themselves in the best possible light for each opportunity.

In the dynamic world of cloud-native applications and Kubernetes, the term “Operator” has become synonymous with intelligent automation. But what exactly are these mystical entities, and how do they revolutionize the way we manage applications on clusters, from deployment to their entire lifecycle?
At their core, Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that leverage custom resources to manage complex applications and their components. Think of them as highly skilled, domain-specific robotic administrators. While Kubernetes provides robust built-in automation for deploying and scaling stateless applications, it often lacks the deep, nuanced knowledge required to manage stateful applications like databases, message queues, or cust…</span>

                              <span>Introduction to any framework begins with writing a simple component. Most often, this component will be a &quot;click counter&quot;. It’s a kind of &quot;hello world&quot; in the world of frontend development. That’s why I’ve chosen it as the basis for this material.
A long time ago, I wondered: is it possible to create frontend applications as easily as in React, but without re-renders and hidden layers for state computation and DOM updates, using only native JavaScript constructs?
Finding the answer to this question and refining the API took me several years of experimentation, rewriting everything from scratch, understanding the essence of the approach, and universalizing the method.
So, without further ado, I want to present the code for this component. Below, I’ll show three versions of the same compone…</span>

                              <span>Burnout doesn’t always look dramatic. Sometimes it feels like being tired all the time. Sometimes it’s not caring anymore, even about things you used to love.
Anyone can burn out—whether you’re working, studying, caregiving, or just trying to do it all. Here are three simple ideas that can help us understand burnout and start feeling better.
“When you’re always tired, feel disconnected, and nothing feels worth it anymore—it might be more than just a rough patch.”
Burnout can look a lot like depression. You might feel numb, frustrated, or like you&#x27;re just going through the motions. It can be hard to tell the difference, and both are important to take seriously.
🧠 What Can Help:  
Talk to someone—a friend, a therapist, or a support group. You’re not meant to carry this alone.

It&#x27;s been almost 50 years since in 1977, the first complex for interactive self-service, which is now known as “kiosk” or “information stand”, was developed. Based on PLATO computer system and therefore named “Plato Hotline”, this device enabled students to access information on extracurricular activities and college courses, as well as view maps, lecture, and bus schedules.

In the 1980s, the developing of interactive voice response (IVR) technology, that was also used for addressing customer queries using automated menus and pre-recorded messages, prompted the emerging of the first devices to replace personal consultations with innovative and convenient remote sel…</span>

Ideally, it would be as simple as providing a link and letting the system handle the rest. To move faster, we decided to start with what looked like low-hanging fruit: UI bug detection.
It sounded simple enough. But once we got into it, we realized just how tricky it was. We explored multiple approaches, ran into licensing and model limitations, spent weeks generating datasets, and rebuilt parts of the system more than once.
This is a step-by-step look behind the scenes at how we designed and developed our UI bug detection system — and what we learned along the way.
From the beginning, we aimed to keep the…</span>

                              <span>As the question of stablecoin regulation heats up in the US Senate, so has the issue of which members are personally invested in cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency firms. 
On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

                              <span>Cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can help investors protect their eroding purchasing power during an era of exponential currency debasement, according to analysts and industry leaders.
Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

                              <span>What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. 
In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here&#x27;s some of our money. We&#x27;re putting it down. We&#x27;re showing that we&#x27;re serious about doing this.”

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000.

                              <span>The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

                              <span>A crypto trader spent $3.8 million to buy Ether at a significantly higher price after selling the asset for almost the same amount about a month ago. 
On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

However, ownership declined, falling to 29% in 2025 from 40% the previous year, according to Independent Reserve’s fifth annual Singapore Crypto Market Survey released on May 21.
The survey, conducted in February with 1,500 participants, revealed that men remain more active in crypto investing than women, 35% compared to 24%.
Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”
Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchav…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

                              <span>Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. 
On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. 
Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.

                              <span>Key points: 

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”
Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many.

                              <span>What is shilling in crypto?            
            
                
At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals.

IBIT’s May 21 net inflows hit $530.6 million, its biggest single-day net inflow since it took in $531.2 million on May 5, according to Farside Investors. The ETF hasn’t had an outflow since April 9.
In one day alone, IBIT has accumulated over 10 times the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) mined over the same timeframe, with it scooping up 4,931 BTC against just 450 BTC produced for the day.
IBIT also saw its largest volume day since January, according to the ETF tracking X account Trader T. 
“Given trading volume today, expect these inflow numbers to increase,” said ETF Store president Nate Geraci.

                              <span>Decentralized finance platform Synthetix has axed its $27 million plan to acquire crypto options platform Derive after negative community feedback.
A Synthetix spokesperson told Cointelegraph on May 22 that its acquisition proposal, pitched to its community and to Derive’s, “did not resonate,” and both projects agreed to “step back from the proposed acquisition.”
Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. 
Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of les…</span>

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each.
ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows.
