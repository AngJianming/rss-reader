setState Feels Delayed in React (And What You Can Do About It)


Hey everyone! If you’ve just started coding in React—creating components and managing state—I’m pretty sure you’ve run into this common issue:
You update the state using setState, and in the very next line, you&#x27;re expecting the new value, right?

const [count, setCount] &#x3D; useState(1);

const handleCount &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
  setCount(prev &#x3D;&gt; prev + 1);
  console.log(count); // This won&#x27;t log what you&#x27;re expecting! It will still log the old value which is 1
};

Let’s explore why this happens and how you can deal with it effectively.
React is More Optimized Than You Might Think


React is designed with performance in mind. Every time a state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect that new changed value in the UI. It was ve…</span>

Companies are constantly seeking ways to optimize performance, minimize downtime, and develop a more resilient workforce. One proven strategy that stands out in this pursuit is cross-training employees.

Cross-training refers to the practice of training employees to perform tasks and responsibilities outside of their regular roles. This approach not only enhances operational flexibility but also fosters a culture of continuous learning and teamwork. Here’s a closer look at why cross-training is becoming a staple in modern workforce development.
One of the most immediate benefits of cross-training is workplace flexibility. When employees are trained in multiple functions, they can easily s…</span>

Ah, JavaScript. For years, I thought it belonged only in the browser. But then I discovered Node.js, and—well—let’s just say my late-night debugging sessions took a much darker (and surprisingly delightful) turn.
Let me take you through how Node.js yanked me out of backend despair and made me believe that server-side code could actually be fun. Yes, fun. I said what I said.
I was knee-deep in legacy PHP code. You know the kind: 200-line functions, zero comments, variable names like $x1, and error messages that make you question your life choices. It was a Tuesday. I remember because my coffee tasted like defeat, and the codebase smelled like 2008.
My teammate casually mentioned, “Hey, have you tried Node.js?”

You have the finest ingredients – the raw data – but simply throwing them together won&#x27;t create a culinary masterpiece. You need to carefully select, prepare, and combine these ingredients in the right way to achieve the desired flavour and texture. This careful preparation is analogous to feature engineering in machine learning.
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to a machine learning model. It&#x27;s the art and science of selecting, manipulating, and creating new variables that improve a model&#x27;s accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability. Instead of feeding a model raw data, we carefully craft features that highlight the patterns and relationships crucial for …</span>

                              <span>“How do I level up as a developer?”
Every junior dev has asked this. Some ask out loud, some keep it quietly in their heads while debugging a mysteriously broken function at 2 AM. The truth is, experience matters—but in 2025, experience isn’t the only teacher. Tools, when used wisely, can fast-track you from junior to senior faster than you might think.
Git &amp; GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket)



“A senior developer isn’t just writing code—they’re collaborating, reviewing, branching, and shipping code like a pro.”
Mastering Git isn’t optional—it’s survival. But beyond git add and git push, senior engineers use Git for versioning strategies, release flows (trunk-based, GitFlow), and advanced debugging (git bisect, git blame, etc.).
Rebase vs Merge (and when to use each)

                              <span>In Excel, you may often work with multiple worksheets or workbooks while managing data. Sometimes, you need to sync data between two or more worksheets. Whether you’re using templates, repeating headers, or shared report values, Excel does not offer a built-in feature to link a selected range across multiple sheets directly.
In this tutorial, I’ve added the two methods including using:
  VBA Code to Sync Worksheets.
  Sync Worksheets values using Select All Sheets option.

Sample Values in Sheet 1 in a Workbook!

Sample Values in Sheet 2 in a Workbook!
  Firstly, you need to select a range of cell values in the current active worksheet that you want to select in the all worksheets.

📱You&#x27;ve defined the problem, analyzed the data, and seen the patterns. The logical next step is to find a solution. But what if the obvious answers, even those suggested by an LLM, aren&#x27;t good enough?
💡This is where innovation begins. The next essential skill is Creative Problem Solving: the ability to think &quot;outside the box,&quot; challenge the status quo, and generate novel solutions.
LLMs generate solutions based on the vast dataset of existing human knowledge they were trained on. True creativity, however, involves generating ideas that have never existed before. It&#x27;s about forging new paths, not just following old ones.
Every major breakthrough in technology came from someone who dared to think differently. Creative problem solving is the engine of progress, allowing us to…</span>

This agent leverages Google Sheets to manage project details, budget breakdowns, and funder requirements, and Google Docs to generate tailored proposal narratives, executive summaries, and supporting documents. The problem it solves is the immense time, effort, and specialized knowledge required to craft compelling and compliant grant applications, often leading to missed funding opportunities or burnout for organizations with limited resources.

Labs have access to advanced tools for generating files, presentations, images, mini-apps, and other interactive elements not available in Research mode.
