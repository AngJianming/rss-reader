                              <span>Legal tech is booming, but building for the legal industry comes with hidden technical, ethical, and compliance challenges..here’s what every dev should understand before jumping in.
So you want to build the next AI tool that revolutionizes law? Great!!legal professionals need better, faster tools. But before you start coding your first legal document parser or compliance bot, there are real-world landmines to avoid.
Legal data is often highly sensitive and subject to strict confidentiality rules (think attorney–client privilege or court-sealed documents). Scraping, storing, or even training on this kind of data without safeguards could expose you and your users to legal risk.
Also, when your AI outputs a compliance decision (e.g., GDPR audit findings or AML flags), you&#x27;re not just providing a &quot;suggestion&quot;, you may be influencing legal liability. Many jurisdictions require explainability, auditability, and even human-in-the-loop systems.
Legal language is dense, full of nuance, and jurisdiction-dependent. Two identical phrases may have opposite meanings depending on where and how they appear.
Of course, you know there are already APIs and frameworks built for legal applications. Don’t reinvent the wheel. 
Legal professionals are risk-averse by design. They value clarity, documentation, and accuracy over speed. Your app’s UX must reflect that. If they can’t trust it, they won’t use it, no matter how smart it is.
Are you building legal tech tools? What challenges have you run into? Drop a comment or connect—let’s push the future of legal AI forward, together.</span>

From schools and offices to entertainment and healthcare, computers have become essential tools in our daily lives. But what exactly is a computer? How does it work? And why is it often called a “digital brain”? If you’ve ever asked yourself these questions, you’re in the right place.
At Tpoint Tech, we believe that understanding technology is the first step toward using it effectively. In this guide, we’ll break down the core components of a computer, explain how it functions, and help you see why this machine is such a vital part of modern life.

                              <span>Introduction
What is a Load Balancer?
Imagine a highly skilled air traffic controller for your data. A load balancer acts as this crucial orchestrator, intelligently distributing incoming network requests across a cluster of servers. Its primary role is to prevent any single server from becoming overwhelmed, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted service delivery. It&#x27;s like having a smart dispatcher for your application&#x27;s traffic, routing each request to the most available and capable server.
Why are Load Balancers Indispensable?
Optimized Performance: By evenly distributing workloads, they eliminate bottlenecks and ensure faster response times, leading to a superior user experience.
Guaranteed High Availability: Should a server fail or go offline, the load balancer automatically reroutes traffic …</span>

If you want to know why I&#x27;m doing this or want to read my take on how accessible code Gemini creates, the first post is available at Does Gemini Create Accessible Android Apps?. 
So, I got into the Early Access Program (EAP) before Junie was generally available and generated the first app. I had all these plans to proceed to the second run and write this blog post sooner, but then life happened, and I founded my own company. Suddenly, time passed, and Junie is now generally available.

  Hi there! 👋


I&#x27;m Rozita, a frontend developer living in Austria. About a year ago, I moved here after working in tech for a few years, and today I want to share a little project that’s very close to my heart: MarkdownResume.app — a small open-source tool I built to help job seekers create clean, simple resumes.
As AI tools and large language models (LLMs) keep evolving, I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about how technical documents — and especially resumes — need to adapt too.
I realized that so many resumes today look beautiful to human eyes, but behind the scenes, they’re a nightmare for applicant tracking systems. It made me wonder:
What if we just wrote resumes in markdown?

If you&#x27;ve found yourself frustrated while working with C# in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) due to the code snippet selection issue, you’re not alone. In VS Code, when you type a snippet, it often appears as the second option so pressing Tab doesn’t automatically select it. This article aims to guide you through how to better manage code snippets in VS Code, specifically for C# development, helping you work more efficiently.
Why Code Snippet Selection Issues Occur
When you type in VS Code, the editor matches snippets you might want to use, showing them in a suggestion list. The issue arises when your desired snippet isn’t the first suggestion. This can happen if there are multiple entries that match what you’ve typed or if there&#x27;s a lack of specificity in your input. This can sl…</span>

                              <span>Hey devs 👋,
I’m Bilal, and today I’m super excited to share something I’ve been working on: CreateNodeSpark—a CLI tool that helps you scaffold Node.js projects exactly how you want them.
We’ve all been there, right?
    You spin up a project with some boilerplate tool…
    It dumps 100 files you don’t understand…
    And suddenly your “simple app” feels like it’s drowning in fluff.
I was DONE with that. So I built create-node-spark.
TL;DR: It’s lean, fast, and 100% customizable.
When you run:
npx create-node-spark
you’re in control of:
    Language: JavaScript or TypeScript
    Framework: Express or None (no framework at all—bare bones)
    Database: MySQL, MongoDB, or None
    ESLint: Add it if you care about clean code (which, let’s be real, you should 😉)
    Multi Setup: Need multiple…</span>

List is the most flexible and commonly used collection in C#. It’s a dynamic array that automatically resizes and provides indexed access.



Use Case
Why Use List




Need dynamic resizing
Automatically expands as needed


Index-based access
Like arrays, but flexible


Frequent insert/remove
Especially at the end


Storing objects or models
Generic and powerful

List numbers &#x3D; new List();

// Initialize with values
List names &#x3D; new List { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot; };

numbers.Add(10);       // Add to end
numbers.AddRange(new int[] { 20, 30 }); // Add multiple

numbers.Remove(20);    // Remove by value
numbers.RemoveAt(0);   // Remove by index

HashSet is one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in coding interviews. It allows constant-time lookup and guarantees unique elements only.



Use Case
Why Use HashSet




Check for duplicates
Fast Contains() check


Track seen items
O(1) add/lookup


Unique collections
Prevents duplicates automatically


Set operations (union/intersect)
Built-in set logic



var seen &#x3D; new HashSet();

seen.Add(5);        // true
seen.Add(5);        // false (duplicate)

bool exists &#x3D; seen.Contains(5); // true
seen.Remove(5);     // removes 5

foreach (int num in seen)
{
    Console.WriteLine(num);
}

public bool ContainsDuplicate(int[] nums)
{
    var set &#x3D; new HashSet();
    foreach (int num in nums)
    {
        if (!set.Add(num)) return true;
    }
    return false;
}

public int LengthOfLongestSubstring(string s)
{
    var set &#x3D; new HashSet();
    int left &#x3D; 0, maxLen &#x3D; 0;

    for (int right &#x3D; 0; right () { 1, 2, 3 };
var b &#x3D; new HashSet() { 2, 3, 4 };

a.IntersectWith(b);  // a &#x3D; {2, 3}
a.UnionWith(b);      // a &#x3D; {1, 2, 3, 4}
a.ExceptWith(b);     // a &#x3D; {1}




Feature
Syntax Example




Declare
new HashSet()


Add
set.Add(value)


Check Exists
set.Contains(value)


Remove
set.Remove(value)


Set Ops

UnionWith(), IntersectWith()

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures used in programming and appear frequently in coding interviews.
An array is a fixed-size, indexed collection of elements of the same type.
// Declare and allocate memory
int[] numbers &#x3D; new int[5];

// Declare and assign values
int[] scores &#x3D; new int[] { 90, 85, 78, 92, 88 };

// Short-hand initialization
string[] names &#x3D; { &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot; };

int first &#x3D; scores[0];
scores[2] &#x3D; 80;
int last &#x3D; scores[scores.Length - 1];

// Using for loop
for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; scores.Length; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(scores[i]);
}

// Using foreach loop
foreach (int score in scores) {
    Console.WriteLine(score);
}

Array.Sort(scores);         // Sort ascending
Array.Reverse(scores);      // Reverse array
int index &#x3D; Array.IndexOf(scores, 92); // Find index of 92




Use Case
Description




Fixed-size data storage
e.g., Top 5 student scores


Indexed logic
Two pointers, prefix sum, etc.


Brute force comparisons
e.g., nested loops for pair matching



public int[] TwoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    for (int i &#x3D; 0; i &lt; nums.Length; i++) {
        for (int j &#x3D; i + 1; j &lt; nums.Length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] &#x3D;&#x3D; target)
                return new int[] { i, j };
        }
    }
    return new int[] { -1, -1 };
}




Feature
Syntax Example




Declare
int[] arr &#x3D; new int[5];


Access

arr[0], arr[arr.Length - 1]



Update
arr[2] &#x3D; 100;


Loop

for or foreach



Sort/Reverse

Array.Sort(arr), Array.Reverse()

                              <span>Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy — urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.
In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

                              <span>BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) capped off the trading week with another day of inflows, pulling in $356.2 million on May 9. The fund has now extended its inflow streak to 19 consecutive days — its longest run of inflows so far this year.
IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

Over the past trading week alone, IBIT posted $1.03 billion in inflows, according to Farside data.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

                              <span>Strategy founder Michael Saylor says Bitcoin hasn’t reached $150,000 yet because holders without a long-term outlook have been selling off while a new cohort of investors are beginning to enter the market.
“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said “lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

According to data from DEX Screener, DOOD’s market cap fell from over $100 million shortly after launch to around $60 million at the time of writing.
Overall, the much-anticipated airdrop was “[d]efinitely underwhelming,” a crypto commentator said in a May 9 X post.

Joining the trend, NFTs in Doodle’s flagship collection sharply dropped in value on May 9.
The collectibles are down roughly 60% to less than 1.5 Ether (ETH) per NFT from about 3.5 ETH on May 8, according to OpenSea. As of May…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana&#x27;s 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the…</span>

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.
According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.
Other crypto ETF issuers share that view. On Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to introduce staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. In April, the SEC delayed a decision…</span>

According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. 
Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning.

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Revenue fell to $34.4 million from $42.4 million in the same period of 2024, according to the company&#x27;s earnings report, published May 9. Cost of revenue rose sharply to $24.5 million, up from $14.4 million a year earlier.
As a result, TeraWulf&#x27;s cost of revenue accounted for 71.4% of total income from operations in Q1 2025, more than double the 34% recorded in the prior-year quarter. In Q1 2024, the company posted a net loss of $9.6 million.

During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much ETH they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: 
“Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it&#x27;s not the case that if you&#x27;re a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential election.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it&#x27;s also created a blind spot that&#x27;s holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They&#x27;re incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That&#x27;s why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

Instead, real-world use cases like student loans backed by DeFi may be crypto’s most convincing value proposition to date.

DeFi student loans
On April 30th, Pencil Finance, a project supported by Animoca Brands and its education arm Open Campus, announced a $10 million student loan financing initiative aimed at providing cheaper, blockchain-backed loans.

                              <span>Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott blamed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act’s failure on partisan politics during a Senate speech on May 8.
Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation, “Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

Ko, a legislator at-large in Taiwan’s legislative body, the Legislative Yuan, took to X on Friday to report that he had advocated Bitcoin (BTC) investment by the Taiwanese government at the National Conference on May 9.
In his remarks, Ko cited Bitcoin’s potential to become a hedge amid global economic risks and urged Taiwan to recognize the cryptocurrency alongside gold and foreign exchange reserves to boost its financial resilience.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin (BTC) is at its highest levels since January, and traders are eyeing key levels to watch for what’s next.

After hitting $104,000, BTC/USD is retracing to establish support, but the fate of $100,000 is among the concerns for market participants.

Current price action represents an important battleground, as measured from the $75,000 lows this year.


” Headline driven” BTC price gains draw scrutiny
Just $6,000 from new all-time highs, per data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView, BTC price action has stunned the market by jumping 10% in days.
The pace of the BTC price gains has come as a surprise for many, but longer-term perspectives show where the most difficult battleground lies.
