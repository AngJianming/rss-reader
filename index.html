Today&#x27;s adventure is a little more of a discussion than a demo, but it&#x27;s super important, especially given how much we&#x27;ve been talking about Git this season.
We&#x27;re diving into GitOps.
Don&#x27;t feel like reading this?  I got you.  Here&#x27;s a Youtube link:

GitOps is a strategy where we manage all of our operations: infrastructure, applications, even data, using Git.
The idea is simple but powerful:

On our last writing we had an introduction to Networks in the Catalysis Ecosystem. We talked about what Networks how, why we should build on them and the various things we can be build on them.
Now on to today&#x27;s big question: WHAT IS A CATALYST SDK?
Catalyst SDK is like a toolbox (or a Swiss Army knife) for developers who want to build AVSs (Actively Validated Services).
It gives you:
Ready-made parts you can plug in and use.
Custom options so you can build things your own way.
Best practices so you build it the right way from the start.
And now just to clear up any confusion we&#x27;re going to talk a bit about Actively Validated Services.

As I continue my 30-Day Linux Challenge in preparation for the RHCSA exam. Today I’m covering something every system admin must know user management in Linux.
Whether you’re onboarding a new team member, securing a system, or automating access control, creating and managing users is one of the most core tasks you’ll perform.
In this article, I’m walking you through the essentials: creating users, modifying them, assigning passwords and removing accounts safely; all using just the terminal.

Our new API brings AI-powered intelligence to resume screening. Instead of just looking for the word “JavaScript,” it asks:  
How experienced is this person with JavaScript?


Is that experience relevant to this specific role?

Does their education, project history, or certifications back it up?
In other words, it thinks like a recruiter—but processes results in milliseconds.

In an age where we’re always connected, the need for a real break has never been more crucial. You know the feeling—the constant pinging of emails, texts, and social media updates, leaving you mentally drained and disconnected from what really matters. If you&#x27;re craving a true escape, there’s no better way to disconnect than with a cabin rental retreat.
A True Escape from the Digital World
Sometimes, the best way to refresh is by completely stepping away from technology. And what better place to do that than a cabin tucked away in nature? Imagine waking up to the rustling of leaves, not the buzzing of your phone. This is exactly the kind of experience cabin rentals offer. They provide…</span>

Building on our earlier discussion about enterprises needing dedicated hosting for MCP servers and ToolHive&#x27;s Kubernetes-based solution, we&#x27;re excited to announce our new Kubernetes Operator for ToolHive. This specialised tool streamlines the secure deployment of MCP servers to Kubernetes environments for enterprise and engineers.
In this article, we&#x27;ll explore practical ways to leverage this new operator&#x27;s capabilities. 
Let&#x27;s jump right in! 🚀
For the installation of the ToolHive Operator, we’ve assumed there is already a Kubernetes cluster available with an Ingress controller. We have used Kind for this post as it is simple to set up, free and easy to use. 
For simplified local ingress setup with Kind we utilise a basic IP with the Kind Load Balancer - feel free to follow…</span>

Your app’s blowing up—users are uploading feline masterpieces left and right, and now third-party developers are knocking at your door, eager to integrate with your API. But here’s the catch: how do you let these apps in without turning your API into a free-for-all buffet of sensitive data? How do you keep your users’ cat video collections safe from the digital wild west? 😱
Cue the entrance of OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect, the dynamic duo of API security! Think of them as the bouncers at the hottest club in town—only the VIPs (authorized apps) get past the velvet rope, and they only get access to the dance floor (your endpoints) they’re cleared for.

By the minute, developers are picking up more interest in the field of artificial intelligence and going further into AI agents. AI agents are autonomous, work with tools, models, and prompts to achieve a given task with minimal interference from the human-in-the-loop.
With this autonomy of AI, I am a firm believer of training an AI using your own data, making it specialized to work with your business and/or use case. I am also a firm believer that AI agents work better in a vertical than as a horizontal worker because you can input the needed guardrails and prompt with little to no deviation.

                              <span>Banking giant Morgan Stanley reportedly plans to list cryptocurrencies on its E*Trade investment brokerage and trading platform.
According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026. The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024.

This would not be Morgan Stanley’s first exposure to digital assets. The bank’s wealthiest clients have had access to crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and futures for some time, with the firm’s advisers allowed to pitch Bitcoin ETFs since August 2024.

Regulatory tailwinds push crypto forward
The news follows previous reports that Morgan Stanley was considering adding cryptocurrency trading to its E*Trade online brokerage platform in early January. The reports at the time cited the expectations of a friendlier crypto regulatory environment.
The move comes amid an increasingly favorable regulatory environment in the United States following the election of President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a pro-crypto platform and is personally involved in several blockchain ventures.  
Related: Morgan Stanley discloses $188M in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings
The first 30 days of the Trump administration brought significant changes to the local crypto industry. More recently, US crypto proponents have shown optimism following the swearing-in of pro-crypto Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins.
The SEC had significantly changed its stance even before Atkins took office. In late February, the agency had already paused multiple cryptocurrency enforcement cases with imminent deadlines.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in that the US Federal Reserve might cut rates sooner than expected.

The restaking narrative has moved fast — from side conversations in validator circles to the forefront of DeFi infrastructure discussions.
It’s not hard to see why. DefiLlama states that major liquid restaking protocols now hold over $12 billion in total value locked (TVL), with dozens of middleware services aligning their security with Ethereum’s economic base layer. What started as an idea to increase capital efficiency for validators has evolved into a serious attempt to redefine how security is provisioned across decentralized systems.
While restaking is gaining momentum among crypto-native participants, institutions — the kind with multi-year horizons and regulatory constraints — still keep DeFi at arm’s length.

Ethereum upgrades are essential to scale, secure and evolve the network without compromising its decentralized foundation.
Ethereum still stands as the heavyweight of smart contract platforms, but staying on top means relentless reinvention. Every upgrade isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a high-stakes move to crack the toughest problems in crypto: clogged scalability, soaring gas fees, clunky onboarding and the constant creep of centralization.
In a race where rivals are slashing transaction times and polishing user experiences, standing still isn’t an option. To hold its ground at the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 as a whole, Ethereum must keep sharpening both its exe…</span>

                              <span>Fragmentation and complicated user experience remain two of the most significant obstacles to cryptocurrency’s mainstream adoption, according to a new industry report. Most users now use at least two wallets to manage their cryptocurrency investments.
The lack of interoperability across blockchains means users need to create multiple wallets to interact with different networks, with users having at least two wallets rising by 16% over the past year. 
According to a research report published by onchain user experience platform Reown and crypto intelligence firm Nansen, 62% of crypto users reported using at least two wallets over the past three months, up from 45% in 2024.
More than 18% of respondents said security was their top concern related to wallet use, while 10.6% cited poor user expe…</span>

The report, published on April 30, alleged that the board had approached recruitment firms due to concerns over Musk’s political activity and split focus across multiple ventures.
Musk took to X to denounce the article, stating that the WSJ deliberately published false information while knowingly excluding an “unequivocal denial” from Tesla’s board.
Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm also issued a strong rebuttal early Thursday morning, posting on Tesla’s official X account that the board had not contacted recruiters.

Strategy’s stock rose 32% in April, its biggest monthly gain since November.

Speculation is building that Strategy will announce a major capital raise during its Q1 earnings call on May 1 as it continues to grow its Bitcoin holdings.

Analysts expect a 1% year-on-year revenue bump to $116.6 million, following the firm’s $120.7 million revenues for Q4 2024.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy closed April with its highest monthly gain since November, ahead of the firm’s highly anticipated earnings call on May 1.
Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, closed April 30 trading at $380.11, a 32% increase from its closing price of $288 on March 31, according to Google Finance data.

The project, which aims to verify humans in the age of artificial intelligence, is initially coming to what it calls the “key innovation hubs” of Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco, according to an April 30 announcement.
World offers a crypto token, Worldcoin (WLD), to those who verify their identity with its spherical device called an Orb, which scans a user’s face and eyes. 
The firm had previously skirted launching in the US due to regulatory concerns over offering a token, fears now seemingly allayed with the crypto-friendly Trump administration.

CertiK said in an April 30 X post that a total of $364 million was lost to exploits, hacks and scams in April, jumping from the $28.8 million recorded by CertiK in March. 
The firm added that white hat exploiters had returned around $18.2 million from exploits on the crypto protocols KiloEx, Loopscale and ZKsync, which brought down the month’s total.
The largest hack in April, and the fifth largest to date, involved an elderly US individual who lost 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million. The Bitcoin was stolen from their wallet after a hacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access on A…</span>

The CCI’s Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) group argued in an April 30 letter to the agency’s Crypto Task Force lead, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, that staking is fundamentally a technical process, not an investment activity. 
“Staking isn’t niche — it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” the letter said. 
The letter responded to the SEC’s call for public input on whether staking and liquid staking, where crypto users lock up their tokens to earn more, should be regulated under federal securities laws.
The coalition called for the SEC to support responsible inclusion…</span>

                              <span>About one in four crypto tokens launched since 2021 have failed in the first quarter of this year amid a crypto market downturn and token creation becoming easier than ever, says crypto data platform CoinGecko.
Since 2021, nearly 7 million cryptocurrencies have been listed on CoinGecko’s token tracking tool GeckoTerminal, and over half, or 3.7 million tokens, “have since stopped trading and are considered failed,” CoinGecko research analyst Shaun Paul Lee said in an April 30 report.
“Alarmingly, the first quarter of 2025 alone saw the collapse of 1.8 million tokens,” he added, which is “the highest number of failures recorded in a single year.” It also comprises just under half of all failures and represents a quarter of all tokens launched since 2021.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

                              <span>Trading platform Robinhood has still managed to beat Wall Street estimates as its first-quarter revenues fell and its crypto trading volume cooled from a record high in Q4.
Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.
Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volum…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

“I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don&#x27;t have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.”

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&amp;P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…</span>

The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. 
The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis, Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana (SOL) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively.
