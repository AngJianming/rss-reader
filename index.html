                              <span>This article presents a practical, scalable, and cost-effective solution for handling large volumes of IoT messages using AWS serverless services. It originated from a real business demand: an environmental services company needed to receive information in near real-time (though not necessarily process it immediately) from geographically distributed sensors, using MQTT as the communication protocol. Below, we detail the main challenges, the proposed architecture, service choices, and the benefits delivered.
The company monitors environmental indicators for large clients, such as hydroelectric power plants. The main requirement was to capture and store field sensor data — for example, river levels — which send MQTT messages periodically. The company’s current system is a monolithic applicat…</span>

                              <span>Multi-tenant architecture is a powerful concept in software development, especially in SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms. If you&#x27;re just starting out in backend or full-stack development, understanding how multi-tenancy works is essential.
What is Multi-Tenant Architecture?
In simple terms, multi-tenancy means that a single instance of your software runs on a server and serves multiple customers (called &quot;tenants&quot;). Each tenant’s data is isolated, but they all use the same application.
Types of Multi-Tenant Architectures:
1. Shared Database, Shared Schema
All tenants share one database and one set of tables.
Tenant data is separated using a tenant_id column in each table.
2. Shared Database, Separate Schemas
All tenants use the same database, but each tenant has its own set of tables (schemas).
3. Separate Databases
Each tenant has its own database.
Offers better isolation and security, but can be harder to manage at scale.

Each tenant can have its own database or share the same one depending on your architecture choice.
Key Benefits:
Cost-Efficient: One app serves multiple users.
Scalable: Easily add more tenants.
Centralized Management: Easier to update and patch.
Challenges:
Data Isolation: Must ensure no tenant can access another&#x27;s data.
Complex Migrations: Updating schemas across tenants is tricky.
Security: More tenants &#x3D; higher security responsibility.
** Best Practices**
Always use tenant-specific identifiers (tenant_id).
Design for scalability from the start.
Monitor tenant performance individually.
Secure your APIs and data access.
Final Thoughts:
Multi-tenant architecture is the backbone of scalable SaaS platforms. Whether you go for shared schemas or separate databases, the goal is to balance cost, security, and scalability.
If you’re planning to build a SaaS product, learning this basic concept and start development.</span>

                              <span>GraphQL is basically a query language for - API´s and it also provides a server-side runtime for executing the queries you have created.
Type system:
You can create a GraphQL service by defining types and fields that we can call Schema, and create functions for each field to provide the required data. This functions are called resolvers.
Creating our first Schema
As you can see, we have a type Query, if we query our field called me, it will return an object User then we will have access to this data. 




Creating the resolver for the field hello on Query type
The resolver is a function with the same name as the field we want to retrieve data. 
Notice that the return will be an object with the same type of User.




How to query?
The default entry point is called Query .
So we can query like this:

If we change the entry point called Query to MyQuery we cannot use only curly braces to query, we must do this way:

Executing Query

                              <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll address a common issue faced by SwiftUI developers when using StoreKit 2 for handling in-app purchases. Specifically, we&#x27;ll explore how to automatically dismiss a modal sheet once a user acknowledges an alert confirming their purchase. This scenario is particularly relevant when you want to enhance user experience by ensuring that the modal does not linger after the user taps the &#x27;OK&#x27; button on a confirmation alert.
Understanding the Issue
When you handle in-app purchases using StoreKit 2, it&#x27;s common to present a confirmation alert to users after a successful transaction. However, many developers find that although the alert is displayed and acknowledged, the modal sheet (which presents ProductView) remains visible. This can lead to confusion and a poor user experie…</span>

                              <span>5 reasons why I migrated to PayPal instead of Stripe for https://Mock-API.net
When I first launched Mock-API.net, I chose Stripe for its developer-friendly API and robust subscription support. But very quickly I hit a roadblock: Stripe requires a registered legal entity before you can collect any payments. For a one-person indie project still testing product-market fit, that barrier just didn’t make sense.
Switching to PayPal was a game-changer. Here are the five key reasons I decided to make the move:
PayPal lets you collect recurring payments using just your personal account. No incorporation, no paperwork, no delay—my users could subscribe the same day I flipped the switch.
Setting up a “$5/month Unlimited Mock APIs” plan in PayPal took under five minutes. Everything from trial periods to billing cycles is configurable in the dashboard—no extra code or third-party plugins needed.
Many developers already have PayPal accounts. Seeing a familiar checkout flow increases confidence, reduces drop-off, and ultimately leads to more conversions, especially on day one when I had zero marketing momentum.
With just a handful of early adopters, PayPal’s fee structure (2.9% + $0.30) ended up slightly cheaper for my low-volume setup. That extra margin helps me reinvest in the product.
Switching over took under an hour. I simply swapped my payment button, updated a few environment variables, and tested the webhook flow. Maintaining the integration has been just as painless—PayPal’s dashboard handles the heavy lifting.
Switching to PayPal unlocked revenue from my very first users—no legal entity required, zero friction, and a trusted checkout experience. If you’re building a side project or MVP and need to start charging fast, give PayPal a try!

                              <span>Eu, você, nós todos já fizemos isso (ou continuamos). True?
Olha esse trecho de código a seguir:
...
{user.name}

...

Simples, inocente… e altamente perigoso.
Em ambientes reais, esse user provavelmente vem de uma API. E o que acontece quando a API falha, atrasa ou retorna um valor nulo?
💣 “Cannot read properties of undefined (reading ‘name’)”

Num projeto real, recebíamos dados de um usuário externo via API. Às vezes, o backend estava lento. Outras vezes, retornava incompleto. A solução?
Programação defensiva com TypeScript + Fallbacks:

Sem erros de runtime quando a API falha.
A interface continua funcionando  , mesmo com dados incompletos.
Experiência do usuário protegida. Reputação da aplicação também.
Tipagem  : A definição de valores opcionais na tipagem vai ajudar a IDE a ti ajudar (linhas 4,5,9) ;
Uso de FAIL FAST: Quanto mais cedo um usuário ou outro sistema for notificado que há um problema com o processamento de sua entrada, melhor ; (linha 14)
Operador || : Para que a imagem não quebre, uma vez que esse operador não só valida quando user.avatar for null ou undefined , mas também quando for falsy — como “” (string vazia), 0, false, NaN. (linha 18)
?? (nullish coalescing operator): utiliza o texto default quando user.name for null ou undefined. (linha 19)
Assuma sempre que nada vai vir como o esperado (ou seja, não confie 100% no seu backend. srrsrs) — e seu código vai sobreviver ao caos da produção.

We also discuss some key use cases that might apply to your environment and list the common challenges you will face when first getting up and running with Terraform to speed up your implementation. Let&#x27;s get acquainted!
Terraform is a key infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool in the DevOps ecosystem. It is designed to manage and automate infrastructure provisioning through code.
Terraform&#x27;s declarative syntax lets you specify the desired state of your infrastructure while the tool determines the necessary steps to achieve it. It supports various cloud platforms and on-premises data centers through plugins called provide…</span>

                              <span>ASP.NET Core is built on a modular pipeline of middleware components that handle requests and responses. These components let you add custom logic before or after processing an HTTP request.
The .NET Core framework includes built-in middleware like:
UseDeveloperExceptionPage


UseHttpsRedirection


UseCors



But what if you need custom logic?
In this article, we’ll show you how to create custom middleware in an ASP.NET Core API to simplify code, reduce duplication, and keep your app modular and maintainable.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

Political shifts
With US President Donald Trump openly backing Bitcoin — and reportedly owning it himself — Held said he sees a regulatory and reputational change.

Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8.
The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement.
“With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…</span>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.

                              <span>The Ethereum Pectra upgrade introduced a significant upgrade in account abstraction accessibility, with multiple wallets already implementing the change.
Pectra introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 7702, a change that Ivo Georgiev, founder and CEO of self-custodial smart wallet Ambire, described as “the single greatest UX upgrade to Ethereum so far.” Ambire is among the wallet providers that have already rolled out support for the new features since Pectra went live yesterday.
Ambire’s announcement shared with Cointelegraph explains that EIP-7702 brings smart account functionality to existing user accounts, letting them temporarily act as smart contracts.

Bitcoin’s realized cap is beating records and has almost reached the $900 billion mark.

The market is laying the foundations for a “potentially significant price breakout,” new analysis says.

Profit-taking is not hindering the overall bull market rebound.

Bitcoin (BTC) is setting new all-time highs in network value as BTC price action eyes a return to six figures.
Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirms new record highs for Bitcoin’s realized cap.
Bitcoin realized cap reflects “growing conviction”
Bitcoin is worth more than ever in US dollar terms if its market cap is measured by the value at which the extant supply last moved onchain.

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.
And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?

Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.

Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza will dominate discussions, but North Korea’s increasing cyber threats and crypto hacks have become a major concern requiring a coordinated international response, Bloomberg reported on May 7, citing people familiar with the plans.
The people said North Korea’s nefarious cyber operations are alarming, as the stolen crypto has become a key funding source for the regime and its programs. 
North Korean-affiliated hacking groups such as the Lazarus Group have already stolen billions of dollars worth of crypto this year, including pulling off the $1.4 billion hack on Bybit in February, the largest ever for the crypto indu…</span>

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

The Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency passed Senate Bill 21 with no amendments on May 7 in a 9-4 vote along party lines. The bill has already passed the Texas Senate, in a 25-5 vote on March 6.  
SB 21 would establish the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” controlled by the state’s comptroller — currently Glenn Hegar — who would be permitted to invest in digital assets that have obtained a market cap of at least $500 billion over the last twelve months, which would currently only include Bitcoin (BTC).

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…</span>

The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.

According to a May 7 announcement, the new feature will allow the platform&#x27;s clients &quot;to send, receive, and hold US-dollar stablecoin account balances, similar to how a traditional fiat bank account works.&quot;
The product&#x27;s technical page shows that the new account feature will support Circle&#x27;s USDC (USDC) and Bridge&#x27;s USDB (USDB) stablecoins. Stripe acquired the Bridge platform in October 2024.
The product will be available to clients in more than 100 countries, including Argentina, Chilé, Turkey, Colombia, and Peru, among others.

                              <span>Brokerage fintech Robinhood is reportedly developing a blockchain network that will enable retail investors in Europe to trade US securities.
According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company&#x27;s local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. 
Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
Tokenizing securities instead of providing direct exposure can offer several advantages: reduced costs by eliminating traditional financial infrastructure, enhanced accessibility, faster settlement…</span>

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide…</span>

In a May 6 X post after court proceedings had likely ended for the day, Karony said he was innocent and “did not commit fraud” in response to media coverage of his trial. The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.
According to reporting from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) on May 6, Karony implied that Nagy, who reportedly fled to Russia after authorities filed charges, was responsible for some of the alleged fraud at Saf…</span>

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward. 
“This resilience isn&#x27;t just about price action — strong fundamentals also back it,” Joao Wedson, CEO of investing analytics platform Alphractal, said in an April X post. “Binance has built a massive ecosyste…</span>
