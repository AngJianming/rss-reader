Access to tools such as web search has enabled chatbots like ChatGPT access latest and updated information, significantly improving their usefulness. LLM or similarly large multi-modal models, when given separate tools to interact with its environment (aka agency) as per its own reasoning, are often termed as AI agents. 
More formally,
“An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfil tasks.”
AI agents are sum of two main components: the brain (an AI model), and the body (its capabilities and tools). They usually has the following characteristics:

                              <span>What If You Could Design Like a Pro Without Writing Code?
That&#x27;s when I learned the magic of drag-and-drop UI tools.
In a few clicks, I was creating components, dragging in buttons, images, and icons—no HTML, no CSS. Three days later, I was presenting a functional UI mockup in Webflow. The client was blown away. So was I.
And that&#x27;s when it hit me:
What Is Drag-and-Drop UI Design?
The tools close the gap between vision and realization. No more waiting for designers or front-end developers. If you&#x27;ve got an idea, you can create it.
Why It Matters (Especially Now)
Cost-effective – No need for full dev or design teams
Accessible – Anyone can learn the basics in a few hours
Responsive design – Tools handle different screen sizes for you
Beautiful templates – Save time with professionally designed layouts
The Top Drag-and-Drop UI Tools in 2025
Framer
Bravo Studio
Softr
Tips to Get the Most Out of Drag-and-Drop Design
Use templates, but make them your own
Test on devices
Don&#x27;t neglect UX
Learn the basics of spacing, alignment, and hierarchy
Who Is This For?
Freelancers who create fast solutions for clients
Developers who are tired of waiting on design assets
Marketers who are putting up landing pages fast
Designers who want to build and test live prototypes of their ideas

                              <span>Goal
STM32(What is STM32?) microcontroller using:
Cycle counters
GPIO pin toggling
STM32CubeIDE&#x27;s built-in profiler (SWV/SWO)

Required Tools

Method 1: Cycle Counting Using DWT (Data Watchpoint &amp; Trace)
Enable DWT Cycle Counter (for Cortex-M3/M4/M7)
c

#include &quot;core_cm4.h&quot;  // Adjust to your core type

void DWT_Init(void) {
  CoreDebug-&gt;DEMCR |&#x3D; CoreDebug_DEMCR_TRCENA_Msk;  // Enable trace
  DWT-&gt;CYCCNT &#x3D; 0;                                 // Reset cycle counter
  DWT-&gt;CTRL |&#x3D; DWT_CTRL_CYCCNTENA_Msk;             // Enable counter
}

Example Usage
c

DWT_Init();

uint32_t start &#x3D; DWT-&gt;CYCCNT;
myFunction();
uint32_t end &#x3D; DWT-&gt;CYCCNT;

printf(&quot;Cycles: %lu\n&quot;, end - start);

Multiply by 1 / SystemCoreClock to convert cycles to time.
Method 2: GPIO Toggling + Oscilloscope/Analyzer
Example
c

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_0, GPIO_PIN_SET);  // Start timing
myFunction();
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOB, GPIO_PIN_0, GPIO_PIN_RESET); // Stop timing

You can observe the pin on a logic analyzer to measure function duration down to microseconds or less.
Method 3: STM32CubeIDE SWV/SWO Profiling
Requirements:
MCU with SWO pin
Use ST-Link or J-Link debugger
Connect SWO pin (often on PB3 or similar, depending on your MCU)
Steps:
Enable SWV I/O in STM32CubeMX (under SYS &gt; Debug &gt; Serial Wire)


In Project Settings &gt; Debug Configuration:




Go to SWV Settings
Enable Trace and Profiling
Launch debugger and open:
SWV Console
SWV Data Trace / Performance Analyzer
Profiling Views:
Function Execution Time
Instruction Count
CPU Usage over Time
Optimization Tips Based on Profiling

Optional: Use CoreMark or Dhrystone Benchmarks
These industry benchmarks help compare MCU performance objectively.
You can run CoreMark on STM32 and see DMIPS/MHz.
ST sometimes provides optimized CoreMark examples in STM32Cube repos.

                              <span>Hi, quick post.
I love speed typing and practice it almost everyday, i think its a great way to practice you brain processor, but, most of the tools that are presented right now is either outdated or do not completely implemented for developers and mirrors what we actually need, so i thought why not implement my vision
Meet the codewave.sh, modern + minimalistic speed typing game for developers

Current features:
15+ programming languages based on 3 levels of difficulty
3 game mods to practice different aspects of typing
20+ code themes from Monokai to GitHub Dark and Nord
leaderboard (try hardcore mode on hard difficulty btw)

My current goal is to build an open platforms so anyone can:
a)practice different aspect of code typing
Right now im working on building a story mode where you can learn different code structure from variable and loops to functions and classes.
Thanks to anyone for reading this, im thinking of opensourcing this project so will be glad to see you!</span>

                              <span>AI has found a new track in the automotive space—this time, in car rentals. Car rental businesses are now leveraging AI and machine learning to transform core functions such as fleet management, pricing, and customer engagement.
So, how does this work technically?
By integrating telematics and AI-driven anomaly detection systems, rental companies can predict vehicle servicing needs. This reduces downtime and ensures optimal fleet availability. Tools like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn can be used to train models on historical maintenance and mileage data.
Using AI models trained on demand signals, weather, seasonality, and competitor data, rental companies can implement dynamic pricing strategies similar to airlines. Frameworks such as PyTorch or XGBoost help in building real-time pricing models.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like Dialogflow or Rasa are deployed for customer support and bookings. Integrating them with CRM systems offers a unified, seamless experience for users.
Time series forecasting using models like Prophet (by Facebook) or LSTM networks is empowering companies to anticipate demand fluctuations and position vehicles accordingly across locations.

                              <span>Understanding lifetimes in Rust is crucial to mastering memory safety without garbage collection. In this post, we break down dangling references, lifetime annotations, and how Rust&#x27;s borrow checker ensures your code is always safe and sound. Let&#x27;s dive in.
Let’s take a look at the code snippet below.
fn main() {
    let x : &amp;i32;

    {
        let y : i32 &#x3D; 10;
       x &#x3D; &amp;y; // This line will cause a compile-time error
    }

    println!(&quot;x: {}&quot;, x);

}

This causes a classic compile-time error in rust  - “borrowed value does not live long enough”. Let’s understand.
y is a variable which is stack allocated and as soon as the scope ends, it is dropped.
     {
        let y : i32 &#x3D; 10;
       x &#x3D; &amp;y; // This line will cause a compile-time error
    }
    //y gets dropped

在户外运动应用中，绘制运动速度轨迹不仅可以直观地展示用户的运动路线，还能通过颜色变化反映速度的变化，帮助用户更好地了解自己的运动状态。然而，如何在鸿蒙系统中实现这一功能呢？本文将结合实际开发经验，深入解析从数据处理到地图绘制的全过程，带你一步步掌握如何绘制运动速度轨迹。

绘制运动速度轨迹的关键在于两个工具类：PathGradientTool和PathSmoothTool。这两个工具类分别用于处理轨迹的颜色和优化轨迹的平滑度。
1.轨迹颜色工具类：PathGradientTool
PathGradientTool的作用是根据运动速度为轨迹点分配颜色。速度越快，颜色越接近青色；速度越慢，颜色越接近红色。以下是PathGradientTool的核心逻辑：
export class PathGradientTool {
  /**
   * 获取路径染色数组
   * @param points 路径点数据
   * @param colorInterval 取色间隔，单位m，范围20-2000，多长距离设置一次颜色
   * @returns 路径染色数组
   */
  static getPathColors(points: RunPoint[], colorInterval: number): string[] | null {
    if (!points || points.length &lt; 2) {
      return null;
    }

    let interval &#x3D; Math.max(20, Math.min(2000, colorInterval));
    const pointsSize &#x3D; points.length;
    const speedList: number[] &#x3D; [];

                              <span>前言
在户外运动中，步频（每分钟的步数）和步幅（每步的距离）是衡量运动效率和强度的关键指标。无论是跑步爱好者还是健身达人，了解这些数据不仅可以帮助他们优化运动表现，还能有效预防运动损伤。然而，如何在鸿蒙系统中准确计算步频和步幅，并将运动轨迹实时展示在地图上呢？本文将结合实际开发经验，深入解析从传感器数据采集到核心算法实现，再到地图路线绘制的全过程，带你一步步掌握户外运动数据的精准计算与可视化展示。

步频和步幅是运动数据中的两个核心指标，它们能够直观地反映运动的节奏和效率。
1.步频：运动的节奏
步频是指每分钟的步数，通常用于衡量跑步或行走的速度和节奏。较高的步频通常意味着更快的运动速度，但也可能因过度疲劳而导致效率下降。理想的步频因人而异，一般来说，跑步时的步频在160-180步/分钟之间较为理想。对于初学者来说，保持一个稳定的步频比追求高步频更为重要，因为过高的步频可能会导致身体疲劳和受伤。
2.步幅：运动的效率
步幅是指每一步的长度，即两脚之间的距离。较大的步幅可以提高运动速度，但过大的步幅可能导致身体重心不稳，增加受伤风险。因此，合理控制步幅对于提高运动效率和安全性至关重要。一般来说，步幅的大小应根据个人的身体条件和运动习惯来调整。例如，身高较高的人可能会有较大的步幅，但过大的步幅可能会导致膝盖和脚踝的过度压力。
二、鸿蒙步数传感器：数据采集的核心工具
在鸿蒙系统中，我们可以利用内置的步数传感器（Pedometer）来获取运动过程中的步数数据。步数传感器能够实时监测用户的步伐，并提供精确的步数统计。以下是步数传感器的使用方法和关键代码解析。
1.步数传感器的初始化与权限申请
在使用步数传感器之前，我们需要申请运动权限，并初始化传感器服务。以下是相关代码：

“It was the worst food I’ve ever had at a Trump golf course,” Nicholas Pinto told WIRED on May 23, while other attendees the outlet interviewed said that the meal was “OK, but not top-class.”
On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.
“The only good thing was bread and butter,” Pinto said, adding he left the venue still hungry.

                              <span>Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.
Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

                              <span>Nvidia will reportedly launch a new lower-cost artificial intelligence chip specifically for China, following restrictions on exporting its more expensive model.
Nvidia plans to start mass production of the new AI chips in June, which will be part of the firm’s latest generation of AI chips, Reuters reported on May 26, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.
An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters it was still evaluating the company’s limited options. “Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the US government, we are effectively foreclosed from Chin…</span>

                              <span>US House Speaker Mike Johnson has brushed off corruption concerns surrounding President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin and dodged answering whether the list of attendees should be released in the interest of transparency.
Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on May 25 that he knew nothing about Trump’s May 22 memecoin dinner and opted not to share his opinion on the event, which 35 House Democrats have called for the Justice Department to investigate.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president doing the exact same thing, you wouldn&#x27;t be outraged.”

                              <span>American banking and financial industry advocacy groups have petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission to repeal its cybersecurity incident public disclosure requirements. 
Five US banking groups led by the American Bankers Association asked the regulator to remove its rule in a May 22 letter, arguing that disclosing cybersecurity incidents “directly conflicts with confidential reporting requirements intended to protect critical infrastructure and warn potential victims.”
The group, which also included the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Bank Policy Institute, Independent Community Bankers of America and the Institute of International Bankers, claimed that the rule compromises regulatory efforts to enhance national cybersecurity.

Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.”
Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier, with several of its customer support …</span>

                              <span>Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns
US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president …</span>

                              <span>Blockchain security firm Dedaub released a post-mortem report on the Cetus decentralized exchange hack, identifying the root cause of the attack as an exploit of the liquidity parameters used by the Cetus automated market maker (AMM), which went undetected by a code &quot;overflow&quot; check.
According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
&quot;This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens.&quot;

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm&#x27;s fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.
Cardone told Cointelegraph the impetus to start the fund followed a suggestion from his brother. The CEO said:

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

&quot;I only buy Bitcoin with money I can&#x27;t afford to lose,&quot; Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company&#x27;s most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy&#x27;s total holdings to 576,230 BTC.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today&#x27;s tran…</span>

                              <span>AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

                              <span>The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.
Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

Hyperliquid&#x27;s native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors — including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states — is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn&#x27;t just power — it&#x27;s a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra&#x27;s OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …</span>

The move came hours after Wynn exited his Ether (ETH) and Sui (SUI) longs at a $5.3 million loss. At the time, he used the proceedings to double down on Bitcoin (BTC), increasing his position to 11,070 BTC.
Wynn began his Bitcoin long position with $830 million on May 21, trimming $400 million in profits the same day. By May 22, he ramped the position back up to $1.1 billion, holding high leverage as BTC crossed $110,000 and gained $39 million on paper. He later sold 540 BTC for …</span>
