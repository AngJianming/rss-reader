🧰 Tools &amp; Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas – for reading and updating the CSV

smtplib – to send emails via SMTP

email.mime – for formatting the emails in HTML

For a long time, I ran my development and DevOps tooling inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It felt like the best of both worlds: I could run Linux commands and tools while still using my Windows desktop apps. I even configured Docker, Minikube, Microk8s and a bunch of other tools to work inside WSL. But as my DevOps workflow grew more complex especially around Kubernetes, CI/CD, and observability I kept running into annoying limitations.
So I made a decision: I wiped the whole windows OS and WSL then installed Ubuntu as my main OS. The result? Everything just works better. Faster. Cleaner. More reliable.
This post walks you through why I switched, what changed, and why I’m never looking back.

  DevOps


DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to unify software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). The goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle and deliver continuous software updates with high quality.
DevSecOps stands for Development, Security, and Operations. It&#x27;s an extension of the DevOps philosophy that integrates security practices into every phase of the software development lifecycle, rather than treating security as a separate or final step.
DevSecOps is the practice of automating, integrating, and embedding security into the DevOps process, making security a shared responsibility across development, operations, an…</span>

Figma has become a go-to platform for designers, and the integration of AI is seriously changing how things are done. It&#x27;s not just about making things look pretty anymore; it&#x27;s about working smarter and faster. Let&#x27;s look at how AI conversion tools in Figma are helping to streamline design workflows.
Automating Repetitive Tasks with Figma AI
Let&#x27;s be real, some design tasks are just plain boring and take up way too much time. AI is stepping in to automate these repetitive actions, freeing up designers to focus on more creative and strategic work. Think about things like resizing elements, renaming layers, or even generating basic layouts. These tasks, which used to eat up hours, can now be done in minutes with the help of AI. F…</span>

                              <span>TL;DR


SnaxVim is a minimal starting point for building your own Neovim setup. It’s aimed at those who want just the essentials for a fast, IDE-like experience — with a startup time that seems noticeably faster than many other distros I’ve tried.
It includes only 10 well-chosen plugins and avoids layers of abstraction, making it easier to learn and customise — similar in spirit to kickstart.nvim, but designed to be even more minimal and curated in its plugin selection.

Before I started using Neovim, I wasn&#x27;t even aware of things like LSP or DAP. In VSCode, everything just worked as soon as I installed a few extensions, so I never had to think about how it all fit together. When I tried to turn Neovim into an IDE, I struggled to gather the n…</span>

This guide walks you through the top 10 algorithms and data structures that consistently show up in coding interviews, complete with examples, visuals, and actionable insights.
Why it matters:

Arrays and strings are the building blocks of most coding problems. Whether it’s two-pointer problems, sliding windows, or frequency maps you’ll see them everywhere.
Common problems:  
Two Sum

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Hey, to all my fellow developers in the trenches of code! Let me guess if this &quot;universal crisis&quot; sounds familiar:
You&#x27;re at your desk, staring proudly at that page on localhost:3000 that has consumed countless hours of your life (and a good chunk of your hair). Suddenly, a notification &quot;dings&quot; on your screen. It&#x27;s your boss/client/product manager: &quot;How&#x27;s that new feature coming along? Send me a link so I can check it out on my phone.&quot;
For a moment, the world freezes.
Your internal monologue probably goes something like this: &quot;Check it out? How? Should I mail you my laptop?!&quot; You can&#x27;t exactly ask them to huddle around your screen, and you certainly don&#x27;t want to go through the whole tedious process of deploying to a staging server just for a quick preview…</span>

                              <span>Displaying large numbers in dashboards or reports can clutter your UI and overwhelm users. Let’s solve this by creating a custom Angular pipe that converts numbers into a more readable format — like 1,500 to 1.5K and 2,500,000 to 2.5M.
In this post, you&#x27;ll learn how to build a clean, reusable pipe that formats large numbers using suffixes like K, M, and B.
Angular comes with built-in pipes (like date, currency, and number) — but sometimes you need more control. A custom pipe:
Keeps templates clean
Promotes reusability
Keeps formatting logic separated from business logic
In your Angular project, run the following command:
ng generate pipe numberSuffix

This creates a new file: number-suffix.pipe.ts.
Open number-suffix.pipe.ts and replace the contents with:
