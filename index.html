                              <span>Slices in Go are a very powerful data structure, demonstrating particular flexibility and efficiency when dealing with dynamic arrays. Slices are a core data structure in Go, providing an abstraction over arrays that allows for flexible expansion and manipulation.
Although slices are widely used in Go, many developers may not fully understand their underlying implementation, especially when it comes to performance tuning and memory management. This article will deeply analyze the underlying implementation principles of slices, helping you better understand how slices work in Go.
In Go, a slice is a dynamically sized array that offers a more flexible way to operate than arrays. A slice is essentially a reference to an array and can be used to access the elements of that array. Unlike arrays…</span>

The TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake is a vital procedure that enables secure communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a web server). Below is a detailed breakdown of the entire TLS handshake process:  
Client Hello  
The client starts the handshake by sending a &quot;Client Hello&quot; message to the server.

This message contains:


The TLS versions supported by the client.

A list of cipher suites (encryption algorithms) it supports.

A random byte string (referred to as Client Random).






Server Hello  
The server replies with a &quot;Server Hello&quot; message.

This message includes:


The selected TLS version.

The chosen cipher suite.

A random byte string (known as Server Random).

                              <span>Is writing a good commit message really that important?
After working on projects for quite some time, I’ve realized that a clear, to-the-point commit message makes teamwork a whole lot easier — and it helps me too when reviewing or debugging code later!
Lately, I’ve been more intentional about how I write my commits, and honestly, the entire process has become smoother and more enjoyable.
Easier team collaboration: No more guessing games about who changed what.
Faster debugging: Tools like git blame and git bisect are only useful when the messages give actual clues.
Quicker code reviews: A good message helps the reviewer understand what to focus on instantly.
The format I follow (and it really works!)
I stick to a simple, consistent format:
(): 

type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test
scope: the part of the project (like auth, ui)
summary: under 50 characters, written in the imperative mood (e.g., “Add”, “Fix”, “Refactor”)
If needed, I also add:
Body: What I did and why I did it (not just what)
Footer: Issue numbers (e.g., Closes #123) or notes about breaking changes
A few real examples I use:
feat(api): add user-profile endpoint
fix(ui): prevent navbar overflow on mobile
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(auth): extract token logic into service
test(payment): add unit tests for Stripe webhook handler
What I avoid now:
❌ Vague messages like &quot;stuff&quot; or &quot;bugfix&quot;

❌ Non-descriptive ones like &quot;updated files&quot;



Since I started following this approach, things have become more efficient — both for me and my team. Less confusion, fewer meetings, and faster progress. 😄

                              <span>Continuing to our last post on the rust language fundamentals, today we will discuss on language foundations. What are variables, constants and Mutability works in Rust.
Understanding how to store and manage data is fundamental. Rust has specific rules around the variables and mutability that are key to its safety guarantees.
let :



Variables are declared using the let keyword:




let variable_name &#x3D; value;

Example:
let my_var &#x3D; 5;

By default, variables in Rust are immutable. Once a value is assigned with let , it can not be changed.
This default behaviour helps prevent the accidental data modification and makes code easier to reason about.
mut :



To allow a variable&#x27;d value to change, you must explicitly use the mut keyword:




let mut variable_name &#x3D; value;

Example:
let mut my_var &#x3D; 123;
my_var &#x3D; 345;

const :



Declared using the const keyword:




const NAME: Type &#x3D; value;

Always immutable, can not use mut with constants.
Must have their type annotated

Can only be set to a constant expression which is computable at compile time.
Often used for hardcoded values and conventionally named in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.
Declaring a new variable with the same name as previous one using let.
Example:




let x &#x3D; 5;
let x &#x3D; x + 1;

The second x is a new variable shadowing the first.
Key difference from mut: Shadowing creates a new variable, allowing you to change the type of the bound to the name. mut changes the value in place but not the type.
Useful for transforming a value while reusing the variable name.
Variables in Rust store data, which can be of various basic data types like integers, floats, booleans, and characters ( we will cover this in more details in coming articles).
Rust&#x27;s emphasis on immutability by default, combined with option of mut and feature of shadowing, provides fine grained control over data manipulation.

                              <span>I found webmaster can go to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools to add sitemaps. This is a continuation per previous discussion on Search Engine Architecture.
A sitemap is simply a file (or sometimes a webpage) that tells search engines about the pages on our site. 
Better discovery: Search engines won’t have to “guess” at pages.
Faster indexing: New or updated content gets found more quickly when we update the sitemap.
Structured hints: Metadata in an XML sitemap gives crawlers extra clues about how often and how important different pages are.
There are two main flavors:
XML Sitemap (for search engines)


It’s an XML‑formatted file (usually named sitemap.xml) that lives at website’s root.
Inside, it lists all of the website’s important URLs, plus optional metadata like:

A constructor is a special type of method it used to initialize objects.
Constructor
Java constructor is special type of method  that are used to initialize object when it is created
It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method ,however constructors  have no explicit return type include void .
You will   use  a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class or to perform any other star-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.
All classes have constructor , whether you define one or not because java automatically provides a default constructor  that initializes all member variables to zero.once you  define your  constructor , the default constructor is no longer used.

For some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain&#x27;s well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn&#x27;t actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.
While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every tra…</span>

Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. 
The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. 
Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.…</span>

Ethereum is forming a bull flag on the daily chart, with a potential breakout to $4,000.

If Ethereum’s network activity and total value locked continue to grow, ETH price may see further gains.

Ether’s price printed a “bull flag” on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong upward momentum. Could a strengthening technical setup and increasing transaction fees signal the continuation of ETH’s rally toward $4,000?
Ethereum transaction fees rising is bullish
Marketwide recovery, fueled by Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs and improving macroeconomic conditions, saw Ether’s (ETH) price rise by nearly 56% to an eight-week high of $2,734 on May 23, from a low of $1,750 on May 6.

On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.
Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.
The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addre…</span>

It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.
Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. 
“This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. 
Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.

In a May 22 announcement, Genius Group explained that it has resumed accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) following a favorable ruling by the US Court of Appeals.

Genius Group announced it increased its Bitcoin Treasury 40% with the purchase of 24.5 BTC, worth around $2.7 million. The company now holds 85.5 BTC acquired for a total of $8.5 million, at an average price of $99,700 per coin.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.

The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.
MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:
1. You need a license
To issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 
2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banks
This is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significa…</span>

Other financial institutions linked to the potential stablecoin include Early Warning Services, the parent company of digital payments network Zelle, and the payment network Clearing House.
The discussions are still in the early stages, and a final decision on the project could change depending on the regulatory environment and the demand for stablecoins.

“Initially, attackers could use the clone to steal passwords, notes, and wallet details to get a glimpse of the wallet’s assets, but they had no way to extract the funds,” the Moonlock team said.
“Now, within a year, they have learned to steal seed phrases and empty the wallets of their victims,” it added.

Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that allow traders to bet on the future price of Bitcoin, which have not been settled or closed, showing the total amount of current market speculation.

Spotting the next big crypto project before it explodes demands data, discipline and a sharp eye for real signals. This guide explores how to identify early winners by analyzing onchain metrics, tokenomics, dev activity and community traction while avoiding the common traps of hype-driven pumps and red-flag projects.
Despite the crypto space being crowded, fast-moving and full of noise, some investors manage to consistently find promising projects while they’re still under the radar.
So, how do they do it? 
Crypto trendspotters know how to read onchain data. They understand tokenomics. They read GitHub commits and follow the money. It takes more than jumping on the hype bandwagon ahead of the crowd.

                              <span>Crypto perpetual futures contracts could receive regulatory approval in the US “very soon,” says outgoing Commodities and Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Summer Mersinger.
Perpetual crypto futures “can come to market now,” Mersinger told Bloomberg TV on May 22. 

“We’re seeing some applications, and I believe we’ll see some of those products trading live very soon,” she said, adding it would be “great to get that trading back onshore in the United States.” 
Mersinger, who will leave the CFTC at the end of May, said having crypto derivatives trading and regulated in the US would be a “really good thing for these markets and would be really beneficial to the industry broadly.”

Boston federal court Judge Richard Stearns sentenced Trung Nguyen, from Danvers, Massachusetts, to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered him to forfeit $1.5 million, the Boston US Attorney’s Office said on May 22. 
Prosecutors said Nguyen ran an unlicensed money-transmitting business called National Vending between September 2017 and October 2020, which used various techniques he learned in an online course to evade authorities.
As part of the course, Nguyen was taught how to conceal his actual business from banks, crypto exchanges and state authorities by …</span>

Republican state Representative Bill Schuette introduced House Bill 4510 on May 21, which would amend Michigan’s Public Employee Retirement System Investment Act to allow the state treasurer, currently Rachael Eubanks, to invest in cryptocurrencies that have averaged a market cap above $250 million over the last calendar year.
Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are the only cryptocurrencies that currently meet that threshold. The bill adds that any cryptocurrencies must be held in the form of an exchange-traded product issued by a registered investment company.
A similar bill was introduced in February, permitting the state treasurer …</span>
