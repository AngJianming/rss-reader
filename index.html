                              <span>In today&#x27;s fast-paced digital landscape, seamless teamwork is paramount. Cloud collaboration tools have emerged as indispensable allies, transforming how we work together, regardless of physical location. Mastering these platforms isn&#x27;t just about knowing the basics; it&#x27;s about strategically leveraging their features to unlock significant productivity gains.
The beauty of modern cloud collaboration lies in its integrated nature. Platforms like Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Asana offer a suite of tools encompassing document sharing and co-editing, real-time communication via chat and video conferencing, and streamlined project management features like task assignment and progress tracking.
Centralize Communication: Move away from scattered emails and embrace platform-specific chat channels for focused discussions. This reduces inbox clutter and ensures everyone stays in the loop.


Real-time Co-editing: Leverage simultaneous editing features on documents and presentations to accelerate content creation and feedback loops. Say goodbye to version control nightmares!


Visual Project Management: Utilize task boards and timelines to gain a clear overview of project progress, identify bottlenecks, and ensure accountability.


Automate Workflows: Explore built-in automation features to handle repetitive tasks, such as assigning tasks upon completion of a previous one or setting up automated reminders.



By intentionally adopting these strategies, teams can experience enhanced communication, improved efficiency, and a more organized digital workspace. Investing time in understanding and mastering the nuances of your chosen cloud collaboration tools is an investment in your team&#x27;s productivity and overall success.</span>

                              <span>Avoiding Clones: Borrowing Smart in Rust


When you first start writing Rust, .clone() can feel like a lifesaver. Need to use a value after it&#x27;s been moved? .clone() it. Want to pass something into a function without relinquishing ownership? .clone() it. But here’s the catch: .clone() isn’t free. Every time you call .clone(), you&#x27;re creating a deep copy of your data, which can incur significant performance overhead.
If you&#x27;re coming from languages with garbage collection, this might seem natural. But in Rust, borrowing is often the better (and faster) way to go. This post will teach you how to recognize when you don’t need .clone() and how to write efficient, idiomatic Rust code by mastering the art of borrowing.
.clone() Is a Tempting Trap


Before diving into borrowing, let’s understand …</span>

This ensures that as a user interacts with one chart, relevant data for the same point (typically based on the x-axis value) is highlighted across all linked charts.
This article outlines a concise and effective solution for coordinating tooltips in CanvasJS Charts rendered within a React application, even when these charts are defined in separate component files. The core of this approach lies in leveraging the showAtX method provided by the CanvasJS API and managing the shared tooltip state using React Context.

                              <span>In an era where data breaches, cyberattacks, and regulatory scrutiny are on the rise, safeguarding information has become a cornerstone of organizational success. ISO 27001, the international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), provides a robust framework to protect sensitive data and ensure business resilience. Far from being a luxury or an optional certification, ISO 27001 is a critical necessity for organizations of all sizes. This blog explores why ISO 27001 is a must-have, detailing its benefits, real-world impact, and actionable steps for implementation.
Trust is the currency of the digital economy. Customers, partners, and regulators expect organizations to handle data responsibly. ISO 27001 signals a commitment to information security, fostering confidence …</span>

                              <span>I got a surprise email from Google recently:
“Your developer account is inactive and may be closed…”
I created this account back when I was still a student, mainly to publish a couple of small side projects. Then I kind of forgot about it. Years passed. Now Google warned me I had 60 days to publish something new — or the account would be deleted. And honestly? I didn’t want to lose it. It held a little piece of my dev journey.
&quot;Okay,&quot; I thought. &quot;I’ll whip something up real quick. Should take, like, 10 minutes!&quot;
And that’s how I ended up building a full open-source crypto portfolio app — with donuts and LLM generated prompts. Here’s how it all spiraled out of control.
My first plan? Just update an old app. But I had forgotten how to React Native. Then I figured, hey, maybe I’ll add some fe…</span>

Whether you&#x27;re a junior dev leaving your first PR comment or a tech lead guiding a team, this guide will help you give clear, kind, and impactful feedback every time.
(Fun fact: Teams with strong review practices ship 30% faster, according to GitHub&#x27;s 2023 research.)
Let&#x27;s be honest: code reviews can feel tedious. But here&#x27;s what happens when you do them right:
Bugs die early: Google&#x27;s research shows 60% of critical issues are caught in reviews
Your team gets smarter: Every PR comment is a mini-lesson (especially for juniors)
No more &quot;WTF commits&quot;: Consistent reviews prevent spaghetti code
Good: &quot;Can we optimize this loop? It&#x27;s O(n²) and might slow down large datasets.&quot;

                              <span>AngularJS, developed by Google, introduced a new way of building dynamic web applications. One of its most powerful features is directives, which allow developers to extend HTML with custom behavior. In this blog, we’ll explore how to use directives in AngularJS, the different types available, and provide real-world examples to help you master them.
In AngularJS, directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, or CSS class) that tell AngularJS to attach specific behavior to that element or even transform the DOM.
In simpler terms, directives are instructions that AngularJS uses to enhance HTML functionality.
Promote code reusability

Simplify complex UI behavior
Separate logic from templates
Create custom HTML components

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) announced that it had released Version 2.0 of the Rulebooks. 
The regulator said it had strengthened controls around margin trading and token distribution services, harmonised compliance requirements across all licensed activities and given clearer definitions for collateral wallet arrangements. 
VARA’s team will engage with licensed entities and expects the companies to comply with the updated rules after a 30-day transition period.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) starts a new week with a long-awaited breakout from a narrow trading range around $103,000. 

BTC price action grabs liquidity before reversing to its starting position, liquidating many an emotional trader on the way. A fakeout or a taste of things to come?

The May 18  daily and weekly close nonetheless became Bitcoin’s highest ever.

US trade deals remain high on the list of macro volatility triggers for risk asset traders this week.

Crypto’s correlation with stocks paints a mixed picture, adding to uncertainty over how macro developments will influence Bitcoin and altcoins going forward.

Bitcoin exchange volume delta becomes a key ingredient in assessing the staying power of BTC price breakouts, per analysis from CryptoQuant.

A crypto drainer is a malicious script designed to steal cryptocurrency from your wallet. Unlike regular phishing attacks that try to capture login credentials, a crypto drainer tricks you into connecting your wallets, such as MetaMask or Phantom, and unknowingly authorizing transactions that grant them access to your funds.
Disguised as a legitimate Web3 project, a crypto drainer is usually promoted via compromised social media accounts or Discord groups. Once you fall prey to the fraud, the drainer can instantly transfer assets from the wallet.
Crypto drainers may take various forms:

Malicious smart contracts that initiate unauthorized transfers.
Fake NFTs or token systems that create deceptive exchanges or assets.

Bitcoin dropped over 4.5% on May 19, confirming a bearish divergence and threatening a break below $100,000.

Analysts highlight $97,000–$98,500 as key support that the bulls must hold. 

A potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern points to a retest of $91,000 before any bullish continuation.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down over 4.5% from its intraday high on May 19, falling to around $102,000 in its worst daily drop in over a month.

Ether’s price fell over 5% to $2,380 on May 19, mirroring similar downward moves across the wider cryptocurrency market.

Long liquidations accompanied ETH’s price drop.

Below $2,400 could be a buy-the-dip opportunity.

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin unveiled a proposal to preserve trustless, censorship-resistant access to Ethereum, even as the network scales. 
On May 19, Buterin shared a post outlining how to make Ethereum’s layer-1 scaling “more friendly” to users running local nodes for personal use. The Ethereum co-founder highlighted the importance of independent users running nodes, saying that a market dominated by a few Remote Procedure Call (RPC) providers risks censorship. 
RPC providers let wallets, users and apps interact with the blockchain without running their own nodes. Crypto wallets are usually connected to an RPC provider behind the scenes. Buterin said there are risks to this setup.

This post explores how to interpret a Bitcoin liquidation map, allowing you to trade smarter in the volatile world of cryptocurrency.
What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader&#x27;s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position. 
Long liquidations occur when prices fall, affecting traders who bet on an uptrend. Short liquidations happen when prices unexpectedly rise, impacting those who bet…</span>

Metaplanet said on May 19 that it purchased 1,004 Bitcoin (BTC) for a total cost of around 15.2 billion yen ($104.6 million), bringing its total holdings to 7,800 Bitcoin worth around $807 million at current market prices.
It is the second-largest purchase the firm has made following its buy of 1,241 BTC for $129 million on May 12 in a move that pushed its Bitcoin holdings above that of El Salvador.

In one of the lawsuits, filed in a New York federal court on May 16, plaintiff Paul Bender argued that Coinbase failed to protect the sensitive personal information of millions of users during the data breach.

Bitcoin developer John Carvalho introduced Bitcoin Improvement Proposal-177 on April 23, which seeks to eliminate the concept of satoshis, of which there are 100,000,000 in 1 Bitcoin (BTC), and effectively split Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million into 21 quadrillion units.
It follows a 2017 proposal from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song to create “bits,” representing one-millionth of 1 Bitcoin. However, Carvalho said Song’s approach would still require Bitcoin users to think about decimals and “shifts complexity rather than eliminating it.”

Plaintiffs Scott Bernstein, Gina Greeder and James Lonergan claimed in the May 13 lawsuit filed in a federal court that Coinbase’s “wholesale collection” of faceprints for its Know Your Customer requirements violates BIPA, as they weren’t notified.
The group claimed Coinbase failed to notify users in writing of the collection, storage, or sharing of their biometric data and the purpose and retention schedule for their data.
“Coinbase does not publicly provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying Plaintiffs’ biometric identifiers as specified by BIPA,” they alleged.

The AFP said its investigation began in September 2018 after law enforcement in Luxembourg shared information about suspicious Bitcoin transactions that the agency claimed were connected to the Queensland man, who was previously convicted of hacking a US gaming company.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin’s rally to $105,980 has traders predicting new all-time highs this week. 

Traders lift their end-of-year Bitcoin price targets to $200,000 based on technical factors and institutional investor adoption. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a narrow range for the past few days, but the rally above $105,500 on May 18 increases the possibility of an upside breakout. Popular trader Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin could soar to $116,000 early next week.
Another bullish voice was that of Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. While speaking to Cointelegraph, Hougan said that a supply shock due to increased institutional demand could propel Bitcoin to $200,000 by the end of 2025. He expects seller exhaustion to occur at the $100,000 level.

&quot;You can&#x27;t &#x27;defend democracy&#x27; by destroying democracy. You can’t &#x27;fight election interference&#x27; by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both.&quot;

Additionally, French law enforcement officials recently announced enhanced security measures for crypto entrepreneurs and investors, following at least three separate kidnapping incidents so far in 2025.

The measures include security briefings and expedited access to police lines in the case of emergencies …</span>

Ether price rose 3% to $2,550 on May 18, triggering $22 million in short ETH liquidations.

A bull flag on the chart suggests a $3,700 target, with analysts predicting Bitcoin’s price to go as high as $5,000 in May.

Ether’s (ETH) price was up on May 18, rising more than 2.5% over the last 24 hours to trade at $2,536. This recovery reinforces the optimism among traders that ETH price could hit $3,000 in May, citing strong technicals.

Every couple of weeks, it seems another layer 2 rolls out, much to the chagrin of some Web3 industry commentators who are concerned about fragmentation. A recent Gemini Institutional Insights report actually noted how a new Ethereum L2 solution is launched approximately every 19 days. In response to the seemingly endless conveyor belt of new zkEVMs and optimistic rollups coming to market, the chorus of criticism continues to grow louder: “This is definitely the saturation point, no more chains are needed.”
Some of the most outspoken critics of L2s argue that L2s are redundant, but this is narrow thinking. In many ways, the idea that creating new L2s should be slowed down is like arguing that there were too many websites in 1998.…</span>

Ammous made the remarks in response to a thread initiated by the pseudonymous developer GrassFedBitcoin, who called for Bitcoin Core to merge pull request #28408, which would enable node operators to filter inscriptions more easily.
According to GrassFedBitcoin, the lack of inscription filtering tools contributes to unnecessary blockchain bloat and undermines Bitcoin (BTC)’s role as a monetary protocol.

Suman, 67, spent nearly two decades as a fabricator in the art world, helping build high-profile works such as Jeff Koons’ Balloon Dog sculptures, according to a May 17 report by Bloomberg.
After retiring, he turned to cryptocurrency investing, eventually accumulating 17.5 Bitcoin (BTC) and 225 Ether (ETH) — a portfolio that comprised most of his retirement savings.
He stored the funds in a Trezor Model One, a hardware wallet commonly used by crypto holders to avoid the risks of exchange hacks. But in March, Suman received a text message appearing to be from Coinbase, warning him of unauthorized account access.

According to the May 16 announcement from the rating agency, US lawmakers have failed to stem annual deficits or reduce spending over the years, leading to a growing national debt. The rating agency wrote:
&quot;We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from the current fiscal proposals under consideration. Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat.&quot;
The credit downgrade is only one degree out of the 21-notch rating scale used by the company to assess the c…</span>
