In this article, I&#x27;ll explore how to leverage GitHub Copilot&#x27;s repository custom instructions and prompt files to supercharge your team&#x27;s development workflow.
By default, GitHub Copilot provides good code suggestions, but it lacks awareness of your team&#x27;s specific:
Coding conventions and style preferences
Project architecture and patterns
Tech stack and tooling choices
Workflow processes
This means you often need to manually adjust Copilot&#x27;s suggestions or repeatedly provide the same context in your queries, which …</span>

In this blog, I will walk you through why MSW mocking is useful, and how to implement it in your React.js application.
Let’s say you’re building a feature that consumes data from a backend API, but:
The backend isn’t ready yet
You’re having CORS issues, and the backend developer took a sick day :(
You’re on a tight deadline



In most cases, you might just mock the data using a single constant.
But there’s a better approach.
MSW works by intercepting actual network requests at the service worker level. What does that means?
Your application thinks it’s communicating with a real API
Your mocks work both in the browser and in tests

You can simulate everything from successful responses to errors, timeouts, and more. This is very important

                              <span>Workplace culture has become a key differentiator in attracting top talent, retaining employees, and boosting productivity. Companies are increasingly realizing that diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) are more than just moral imperatives—they’re business imperatives. Yet, despite widespread commitments to equity and belonging, many organizations still struggle with one crucial component: the language used in everyday workplace communication.
inclusive language tool becomes not just helpful—but essential.

The Business Case for Inclusive Language
The benefits of inclusive language extend beyond interpersonal harmony. Numerous studies link inclusive workplaces to higher employee satisfaction, stronger team collaboration, and improved organizational performance. When employees feel heard and respected, they’re more likely to contribute their best work.
Moreover, inclusive communication plays a crucial role in external branding. The way your team speaks internally influences how you engage with customers, partners, and the broader community. Companies that embrace inclusivity are better positioned to attract diverse talent, win consumer trust, and avoid costly reputational risks.
Making an inclusive language tool part of your organizational toolkit is not just a nice-to-have—it’s a strategic investment in your people, your culture, and your bottom line.
**Take the First Step Toward Equity
**Creating a truly inclusive workplace doesn’t happen overnight. It takes commitment, consistency, and the right tools to support behavior change. Language is a foundational element of this journey. By equipping your team with tools that promote inclusive communication, you lay the groundwork for a culture of respect, empathy, and equity.</span>

I just pushed live the landing page for a SaaS project I’ve been working on, and I’d love to get your thoughts.
🔗 Here’s the link: Link
Right now, the main goal of the page is to:
See if the core idea clicks with people
Start building a waitlist of folks who might be interested
Get some honest feedback before going too deep
And make sure the messaging/design actually make sense
I’m especially curious to know:
Does the message come across clearly?
Is the layout easy to follow and not too cluttered?
Would you be interested enough to sign up or keep following the project?
Trying not to over-explain the product here just want to see if the landing page does its job on its own.
Any feedback is super welcome good, bad, or brutally honest. Thanks a ton in advance 🙏</span>

You can call toSql() on any Query Builder instance to see the SQL statement it will execute—without actually running the query.
DB::table(&#x27;users&#x27;)-&gt;toSql();
// Output: select * from &#x60;users&#x60;

It also works with conditions:
User::where(&#x27;status&#x27;, 1)-&gt;toSql();
// Output: select * from &#x60;users&#x60; where &#x60;status&#x60; &#x3D; ?</span>

When I’m inspired, I can be motivated almost to mania. I’ll start a side project and spend all my free time working on it. I’ll immerse myself in Polish music, and watch Polish Peppa Pig. The ideas feel complete and within my reach if I just push a little further.
And then comes the crash.
Maybe work gets busy or the task becomes more demanding than expected. Maybe life just barges in, uninvited. Whatever the reason, my energy runs out. The inspiration is still there, just… shoved to the back. I feel guilty. I wonder why I can’t just push through it — why I can’t just stick with it.
I know I’m in obsession mode when I’m on my personal laptop in the morning, maybe again at lunch, and definitely after work and on weekends. I’m a develop…</span>

An oil change light is a self-reminder feature for oil changes built into modern vehicles and is different from oil pressure warning lights because it warns of low oil pressure and the chances of an engine developing damage.

XRP price is forming a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong bullish momentum following an upward breakout. Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?

                              <span>GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account.
The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin (BTC) or when the purchases were made. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.
The announcement is GameStop&#x27;s first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies.
GameStop (GME) stock shares have climbed amid the speculation, jumping 12% in March. February rumors helped fuel an 18% spike in GME stock prices.
According to TradingView, GameStop shares closed at $35 on May 27 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market at the time of publication. The stock is up around 30% in the past 30 days, with year-to-date gains of about 10%.
Cointelegraph contacted GameStop for comment regarding its Bitcoin purchase but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Plecas will be responsible for shaping and executing TON’s payment infrastructure strategy, the company said in a May 28 blog post.
He is tasked with expanding the network’s capabilities, managing financial partnerships and ensuring compliance across jurisdictions as the foundation scales services for over 1 billion Telegram users.
“Joining TON Foundation represents an incredible opportunity to shape the future of payments on a truly global scale,” Plecas said.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

Let’s look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin price remains stuck.
Bitcoin runs into resistance at $110,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price oscillates within a tight range between $106,600 and $110,700, with no clear directional bias.

The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release.
The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years.
“I’m incredibly proud of our team’s tenacity and focus, which led to quarterly profitability in Q4 2024, a pivotal milestone that confirms the value of our approach,” CEO Franz Bergmueller said.

As part of the sale, Telegram is offering investors five-year bonds at a 9% yield, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.
Telegram plans to use the proceeds to buy back remaining debt from bonds issued in 2021, which are due to mature in March 2026.

In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.

                              <span>White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks says the US could buy more Bitcoin if the government can fund the purchase in a “budget-neutral” way without a tax or adding to the growing national debt.
Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

Guo will face the court on “allegations relating to multiple breaches of his directors’ duties,” the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a May 28 press release.
ASIC alleged Guo made multiple breaches of directors’ duties relating to his dealings with ACX Exchange customer funds, and claimed he made false and misleading statements about those dealings and failed to maintain proper books and records. 
The now-liquidated Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from mid-2016 until December 2019, when it collapsed as customers could no longer withdraw their assets.

“I don’t understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner,” MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe said in a May 28 X post.
Calls for altcoin season mount
“They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the deal, El Salvador will need to fulfill its prior obligations around limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin (BTC), and it will have to cease its involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July.
“On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said.

The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. 
“I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said.

Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

                              <span>Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of $111,970 has sparked optimism among crypto market participants, but whether that carries through into the third quarter of this year remains uncertain, analysts say.
“The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3,” Bitfinex analysts said in a May 28 markets note.
Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy”
Bitcoin (BTC) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22; however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter. 
“A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher,” the analys…</span>

                              <span>Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

                              <span>Nasdaq has filed for crypto asset manager 21Shares to list a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US, initiating the Securities and Exchange Commission’s review process.
The stock market’s May 23 19b-4 filing, which asks the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, follows 21Shares’ April 30 submission of its S-1 registration statement to the SEC, which asked the regulator to approve trading of the proposed fund.
Both regulatory filings are needed for the Sui (SUI) tracking fund to go live, with the 19b-4 filing kicking off the SEC’s review process. The agency must decide whether to accept, reject or delay the application within 45 days and it can delay its decision multiple times, for a maximum review period of 240 days.
The SEC must decide on 21Shares’ application by Jan. 18, 2026, at the…</span>

SharpLink Gaming establishes the first ETH treasury, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. 

Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.”
In March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin (BTC) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. 
As Cointelegraph reported, the Trump administration has reiterated the need to use “budget-neutra…</span>

                              <span>Selling Bitcoin is like “playing in a really bad house-rate casino,” according to Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest adopters. In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

                              <span>Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services.
According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears.

Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside.

Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s (BTC) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions.
