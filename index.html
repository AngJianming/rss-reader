                              <span>Understanding data structures is essential for every programmer. Whether you&#x27;re writing simple scripts or building complex systems, knowing the right way to store, manage, and access data can dramatically improve your code’s performance and readability. Mastering data structures also plays a big role in coding interviews, making them a key area for anyone pursuing a career in software development.
Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They store elements in a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory and allow direct access to elements using indexes. Their simplicity and efficiency make them ideal for tasks like storing sequences or performing quick lookups when the index is known. However, since their size is fixed, inserting or deleting elements can be less efficient.

That’s where CI/CD pipelines come in. They automate the entire workflow:

Depo yönetimi uzun yıllar boyunca elle yapılan işlemler, kâğıt formlar ve Excel tablolarıyla yürütüldü. Ancak günümüzün hızla büyüyen e-ticaret ve üretim sektörlerinde bu yöntemler artık yeterli değil. Gerçek zamanlı takip, minimum hata oranı ve entegre sistemler, işletmeler için vazgeçilmez hale geldi.
İşte bu dönüşümün tam kalbinde Depo Yönetim Sistemi (WMS) yer alıyor.
WMS (Warehouse Management System), depo içi operasyonları dijitalleştiren, ürün hareketlerini izleyen, stok doğruluğunu artıran ve lojistik süreçlerde maksimum verimlilik sağlayan yazılım sistemidir.
Stokların anlık takibi yapılır
Giriş, çıkış ve iade süreçleri dijitalleşir

                              <span>Prerequisites



AWS console access
S3 bucket
Two Amazon SNS
Lambda configuration

Step 1: Create first SNS

Add SNS policy




{
  &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
  &quot;Id&quot;: &quot;sns-ID&quot;,
  &quot;Statement&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;Example SNS topic policy&quot;,
      &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
      &quot;Principal&quot;: {
        &quot;Service&quot;: &quot;s3.amazonaws.com&quot;
      },
      &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;SNS:Publish&quot;,
      &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;SNS-topic-ARN&quot;,  #arn of thie created sns
      &quot;Condition&quot;: {
        &quot;StringEquals&quot;: {
          &quot;aws:SourceAccount&quot;: &quot;426857564226&quot;
        },
        &quot;ArnLike&quot;: {
          &quot;aws:SourceArn&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:s3:::prashansa-sns-bucket&quot;
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

*Step 2: * Go to subscription and click on create subscription
Create subscription setting protocol as AWS Lambda that means the destination of this SNS is AWS Lambda. 

Step 3: Create another SNS
Another SNS for notifying user via email

Set policy for this SNS
*Step 4: * Create subscription
Set the protocol to email for this SNS to send direct notification to the user via email

*Step 5: * Create S3 bucket

Step 6: Go to properties &gt; event notification &gt; create event notification

Step 7: Go to Destination
Scrolling down there is destination

Step 8: Create lambda function

Step 9: Add trigger
Add the first SNS whose protocol was set to lambda as trigger

Step 10: Set Lambda destination
In the lambda destination, set the SNS secondly created that was set the protocol for email as the lambda destination

Step 11: Upload the image in S3 bucket

Step 12: Check the email for notification

                              <span>Multi-tenancy is a type of software architecture where multiple users share a single infrastructure resource. A multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster serves several customers, teams, or apps, improving cost efficiency and ease of management.
Correctly configuring Kubernetes for multiple tenants can be challenging. You must isolate your tenants properly, set correct resource constraints to maintain performance, and enable monitoring systems to track tenant activity. 
This guide explores these requirements and explains how built-in features and external tools help you build an effective multi-tenant Kubernetes environment.
Kubernetes multi-tenancy is the practice of using one Kubernetes cluster to operate workloads belonging to several independent customers, projects, or environments. The workload…</span>

                              <span>Q: How many tags should we slap on our AWS resources?
A: Look, I&#x27;ve been doing this for years across probably 20+ different companies, and here&#x27;s what actually works in the real world. Most places that don&#x27;t hate their lives use around 5-8 mandatory tags - stuff like CostCenter, Environment, Owner, Project, Application. That&#x27;s your baseline. Then maybe 3-5 more depending on what kind of weird edge cases your business throws at you.
But seriously, don&#x27;t be that guy who tries to tag literally everything. I worked at one place where they had a 23-tag minimum. Nobody followed it. Half the tags were garbage. The whole thing was a mess. Stick to tags that solve actual problems you&#x27;re having right now.
Q: What&#x27;s the difference between cost allocation tags and regular tags anyway?

                              <span>In this article, I will show you how to read JPEG images in Java using ImageIO and JDeli. We also have a related article covering how to write JPG files in Java.
ImageIO is able to handle most JPEG files but does not fully implement the spec. If you want more complete JPEG support, JDeli has been written to provide this. JDeli is the best enterprise-level Java image library for image manipulation.
Create a File, InputStream or URL Object pointing to the JPEG.
Pass the value into ImageIO which will convert to a BufferedImage.
File file &#x3D; new File(&quot;/path/to/image.jpg&quot;);
BufferedImage image &#x3D; ImageIO.read(file);

Add JDeli to your class or module path (download the trial jar).
Create a File handle, InputStream pointing to the raw JPEG image. You can also use a byte[] containing the image data.
Read the JPEG image into a BufferedImage
File file &#x3D; new File(&quot;/path/to/image.jpg&quot;);
BufferedImage image &#x3D; JDeli.read(file);

In this article you learned how read JPEG images in Java. Our Java image library JDeli has JPEG support for writing and converting as well, you can learn more on our support site.</span>
