                              <span>In the world of software engineering, designing systems that are scalable, maintainable, and robust is just as important as writing clean code. That’s where System Design comes in — and within system design, two foundational concepts stand out: High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD).
High-Level Design is the architectural blueprint of a system. It focuses on what the system should do and how major components interact with each other.
🧱 Key Characteristics:
Describes the overall architecture
Focuses on major modules and data flow
Identifies external interfaces
Helps in choosing the tech stack
Think in terms of services, databases, queues, APIs

Component diagrams
ER diagrams (basic database design)

Raycast has a nice feature called AI Commands, which allows you to add instructions and placeholders, making it easier to call the command later.

These instructions come with placeholders that make the command highly customizable.

In my case, I use the {argument name&#x3D;&quot;I did:&quot;} placeholder. Before Raycast runs the AI command, it asks me, &quot;I did:&quot; so I can write a brief summary of what I did.
I include browser and web context since in my prompt I include reference to conventional commits documentation

But what you may not know is that in its latest version, React Router has evolved significantly. It now incorporates concepts from Remix like loaders, actions, ErrorBoundaries, SSR support, and more.
Remix? That’s right. The Remix framework has always been built on top of React Router. But with this new version (v7), the experience has been unified—now you can use that same architecture directly in React Router, without needing to adopt a full framework.
The best way to understand what React Router v7 brings is by looking at its three usage modes, each designed for different levels of…</span>

Why, when talking about AI, do I almost always primarily mean Augmented, not Artificial Intelligence? 
What is Augmented Intelligence anyway? 
In translation, this would sound like – Augmented, not Artificial intelligence.
It&#x27;s quite difficult to establish the authors of the term, because the idea began developing long ago, long before the appearance of transformers, roughly around the same time when AI was first talked about as Artificial (late 60s, early 70s). 
Augmented Intelligence is talked about in so many ways – both as a system design pattern, and as an approach to &quot;human enhancement,&quot; productivity improvement. The word Augmented appears in the context of theoretical LLM training methodologies and much more. Someone, for example, would rather remember AR,…</span>

                              <span>What if designing a SwiftUI form was as easy as describing it in plain English?



Imagine building user interfaces in your iOS app without writing a single line of SwiftUI layout code. That’s now possible with the help of Generative AI. In this guide, you’ll learn how to dynamically generate SwiftUI forms from AI-generated JSON layouts — perfect for login, registration, or survey flows that may change often.
In this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn how to:
Create form layouts from natural-language prompts
Decode them from JSON
Render SwiftUI views dynamically
Bind user input and handle actions like “Register”
Safely load your OpenAI API key from a .env file
A full registration form with:
🖼 A logo image at the top
All dynamically generated from AI using a simple prompt.

git reset --hard
git clean -d -f

The convergence of AI-assisted programming and language preservation is creating unprecedented opportunities for cultural heritage protection and community empowerment.

Vance highlighted the strategic and geopolitical importance of Bitcoin, emphasizing that the US should maintain leadership in the crypto industry to remain competitive in the age of digital finance. Vance told the audience:
&quot;What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we do not make the right decisions. The first thing that I would ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.&quot;

                              <span>BlackRock is reportedly planning to take a significant stake in Circle’s upcoming initial public offering (IPO). 
According to a May 28 Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, BlackRock is looking to purchase roughly 10% of the offering. Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, is aiming to raise $624 million in its initial public offering
Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management is also interested in buying $150 million worth of shares in the offering, the report said. 
Circle launched its offering of 24 million shares of Class A common stock on May 27. The offering consists of shares from the company as well as shares of existing stakeholders, including co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire. According to the report, Circle’s IPO has now received orders for multiple times the shares available.
The company filed for an initial public offering on April 1, but delayed plans citing economic uncertainty. Crypto firms Ripple and Coinbase were reportedly exploring a potential acquisition of Circle. The company has since dismissed the speculation, saying it “is not for sale.”

USDC market share
With a market capitalization of $60.9 billion as of May 28, Circle’s USDC (USDC) represents 24.6% of the stablecoin market, only behind Tether’s USDt (USDT).

According to its Form S-1 registration statement, Circle had $1.67 billion in revenue in 2024, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. However, its net income fell from $267.6 million in 2023 to $155.7 million in 2024, a 41.8% decline.
Circle’s main competitor, Tether, is seemingly not interested in pursuing an IPO. In an X post on April 4, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that “Tether doesn’t need to go public.”

Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. 
Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams.

Cybersecurity firm Cyvers said the hack occurred at 11:23:19 UTC and was funded by an address ending in “762B.” According to the firm, the attacker used the exploit to steal roughly 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH), which was converted to Ether (ETH) almost immediately after the attack.
“We are investigating a potential exploit on Cork Protocol and are pausing all contracts. We will report back with more information,” Cork Protocol co-founder Phil Fogel wrote on X.

A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.
Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized …</span>

                              <span>Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?            
            
                
Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.
Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.

Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.
Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.
Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.
Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.

Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block.
Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game.
Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home.
Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost.

Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made.
Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you&#x27;ve seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy, which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin (BTC), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset.

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake.
It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling.
Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far).

                              <span>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. 
Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. 
This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. 
The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined.

Gooner EMA is a technical indicator created by trader NebraskanGooner that uses the 11- and 22-period exponential moving averages (EMA). When the price crosses above the EMA range, it often leads to further gains. 
When the price closes below the EMA range, it tends to follow deeper losses.

XRP’s falling wedge pattern signals a bullish reversal; 48% price surge potential.

SEC’s review of WisdomTree’s XRP ETF may spark investor interest as approval odds jump to 84% on Polymarket. 

XRP price is forming a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a technical chart formation associated with strong bullish momentum following an upward breakout. Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?

The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin (BTC) or when the purchases were made in the announcement, while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing.
The announced acquisition is GameStop&#x27;s first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March.
At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier.

The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release.
The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years.

Bitcoin whales are adding to their BTC positions while price ranges below all-time highs.

If a new market correction comes, one potential bounce level lies in the mid-$90,000 zone.

Hyperliquid trader James Wynn hints at large-volume traders shaping low-timeframe price performance.

Bitcoin (BTC) may see support only at $94,000 if a fresh BTC price correction ensues, new analysis says.
In its latest X commentary, Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, pointed to a Bitcoin bounce zone at the 21-week moving average.

                              <span>Sui-based decentralized exchange Cetus may be one step closer to recovering funds lost in a recent exploit, pending the outcome of a community governance vote scheduled to end June 3.
Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.
The vote is part of a broader recovery plan that includes using Cetus’s treasury and securing an emergency loan from the Sui Foundation.

In a May 28 announcement, the company said it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value.
Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin (BTC) buys.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

“They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.
