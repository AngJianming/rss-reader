                              <span>I am trying to create an application for Android TV using Kotlin. The goal is to launch the application automatically when the TV boots up.
I have already created the app using a BootReceiver and BroadcastReceiver, which works correctly on Android 9 and below. However, it does not work on devices running Android 10 or above.
I also created another version of the application as a launcher app. I disabled the system launcher through ADB and set my app as the default launcher. This also works perfectly on Android 9 and below, but not on Android 10 or above.
How can I achieve the desired behavior on Android 10 and above?</span>

I wanted to learn how to set up the foundation of a CI/CD pipeline. This project walked me through the process of launching an EC2 instance and using it to build and edit a web app — completely in the cloud.
We started this project by launching an EC2 instance because EC2 instances are like virtual computers that live in the cloud. We want our web app to live entirely in the cloud, so we are launching an EC2 instance to even develop our web app&#x27;s code.
A key pair is a mechanism for us to access EC2 instances. I created a key pair that AWS stores the public part of, and I downloaded the private key. AWS will authenticate t…</span>

But what is lefthook?
LeftHook is a fast and powerful Git hooks manager for any type of projects.
npm install lefthook --save-dev

Configure your hooks, install them once and forget about it: rely on the magic underneath.
# Configure your hooks
vim lefthook.yml

# Install them to the git project
lefthook install

# Enjoy your work with git
git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m &#x27;...&#x27;

I picked the installation and usage from the lefthook documentation.
So obviously there is a lot of information in the documentation. We want to focus only on the options used in n8n lefthook.yml file.

MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol that allows electronic musical instruments, computers, and other devices to communicate with each other. A MIDI sound module is a device that generates sounds based on MIDI messages sent to it.
Raspberry Pi. A credit-card-sized computer that can be used for a variety of projects. It can be connected to an external USB as powersource
USB MIDI interface: A device that connects MIDI devices such as a computer via USB. Some may appear like keyboards or even pads.

                              <span>Pernahkah kamu merasa kalau teknologi AI sekarang seolah bisa membaca pikiran kita? Misalnya, ketika aplikasi musik tiba-tiba merekomendasikan lagu yang sangat cocok dengan selera kita, atau iklan yang muncul selalu terasa seperti dibuat khusus untuk kita. Hal ini terjadi karena AI makin pintar dan makin meresap ke dalam kehidupan sehari-hari. Fenomena ini penting untuk dipahami oleh siapa saja yang menggunakan teknologi digital—mulai dari pelajar, pekerja, hingga pebisnis—karena AI kini sangat memengaruhi cara kita hidup dan bekerja.
Kenapa AI bisa makin pintar? 
bagaimana AI bisa tahu apa yang kita suka? 
Dampaknya pada kehidupan kita sangat beragam. 
Contohnya, AI mungkin salah memprediksi preferensi kita, sehingga kita kehilangan kesempatan mendapatkan informasi penting. Seringkali, kita tidak sadar bahwa keputusan sehari-hari sudah dipengaruhi oleh AI karena prosesnya berjalan secara otomatis dan tersembunyi.
Lalu, bagaimana kita menyikapi perkembangan ini supaya AI tidak merugikan? Pertama, kita perlu memahami bagaimana AI bekerja dan data apa saja yang kita bagikan. 
Kedua, gunakan fitur privasi yang tersedia di aplikasi dan perangkat digital. 
Ketiga, selalu kritis terhadap rekomendasi dan informasi yang diberikan oleh AI. Misalnya, jangan langsung percaya iklan yang muncul, tetapi cek dulu keasliannya agar tidak mudah tertipu. Dengan edukasi dan kesadaran yang baik, kita bisa lebih aman dan cerdas dalam memanfaatkan teknologi AI.
Bayangkan kamu sedang mencari pekerjaan, dan platform rekrutmen berbasis AI merekomendasikan pekerjaan yang tidak sesuai dengan minatmu hanya berdasarkan data lama yang pernah kamu input. 
Apakah kamu akan mengikuti saran itu begitu saja? *
Ini contoh nyata bagaimana AI yang makin meresap bisa memengaruhi keputusan penting dalam hidup kita. Oleh karena itu, yuk mulai kenali AI yang kamu gunakan, atur privasi dengan baik, dan jangan takut bertanya serta belajar supaya AI benar-benar menjadi alat yang membantu, bukan justru mengatur hidup kita tanpa kita sadari.</span>

                              <span>Master Data Management (MDM) is often overlooked until microservices start misbehaving due to data inconsistencies. If your services rely on customer, product, or vendor data and you&#x27;re not managing it centrally, you&#x27;re inviting chaos. Let&#x27;s fix that.
Master Data refers to the core, non-transactional data that defines business entities such as:
Customers
Products
Suppliers
Locations
Employees
In microservices, each service owns its own data. But when multiple services need shared, consistent master data, things get complicated.
❌ Customer name mismatch across systems
❌ Product catalog inconsistencies
❌ Data duplication &amp; syncing nightmares
❌ Hard-to-maintain integration logic
Centralized MDM Service


Create a dedicated microservice that exposes APIs for master data (e.g., CustomerService,…</span>

Webflow is a popular choice among web designers and developers for crafting visually compelling websites without extensive coding. However, exporting these creatively designed websites as static files directly from Webflow comes with some limitations, especially when it involves CMS content. If you’re seeking a seamless way to export your entire Webflow site as static files, tools like ExFlow come in handy.
Exporting your Webflow site as static files can offer numerous benefits:
Portability: Host your site on a server of your choice.
Cost Efficiency: Avoid Webflow’s premium hosting fees.
Customization: Modify exported files for deeper customizations.
ExFlow is a powerful tool designed to bridge the gap left by Webflow’s exporting limitations. It…</span>

“Access to fetch at ‘https://api.example.com’ from origin ‘https://yourapp.com’ has been blocked by CORS policy…”
You’re not alone. Let’s dive into what CORS is, why it exists, and how to fix it.
CORS?


CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser-enforced security feature that prevents your frontend app (served from one origin) from accessing resources from another origin unless explicitly allowed by the server.
This behavior stems from the Same-Origin Policy, which is designed to help prevent cross-site attacks.
How CORS Works


When your frontend makes a request to another origin, the browser sends an Origin header:
Origin: https://myapp.com

If the server responds with:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com
Preflight Requests


For requests using methods like POST, PUT, or custom headers, the browser sends a preflight OPTIONS request to check if it’s safe.
If the server doesn’t respond correctly, the browser cancels the actual request.
Backend Config: Enabling CORS


Here’s how to configure CORS in common backend frameworks:
🟢 Express.js
const cors &#x3D; require(&#x27;cors&#x27;);

🐍 FastAPI
app.add_middleware(
https://myapp.com&quot;],
&quot;],
&quot;],
❗ Common CORS Issues



❌ Missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
❌ Wildcard origin (*) used with credentials
❌ Server doesn’t respond to OPTIONS preflight
🧠 Dev Tips
Use tools like http-proxy-middleware or Vite’s proxy config during local development.
Never disable CORS in production — configure it properly.
✅ Final Thoughts


CORS is not a bug — it’s a feature 🔐
Understanding how it works makes you a more confident full-stack developer and prevents hours of frustrating debugging.

                              <span>The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s sole Democratic Commissioner has said the agency is “playing a game of regulatory Jenga” with its approach to the crypto industry and market regulation under the Trump administration. 
In May 19 remarks at the SEC Speaks event, Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw cautioned against what she described as a dangerous dismantling of “discrete but interrelated rules” on crypto and the wider market.
She likened market stability to a “Jenga tower” that the agency’s rules had “carefully developed over the years,” which could topple if some rules were removed.
In addition to a lamentable loss of staff, Crenshaw said the SEC has used staff guidance to effectively reverse rules without proper analysis or public comment, particularly around crypto

The exchange said in a May 16 filing to a New York federal court that its terms of service, which it claimed the class group agreed to, has a clause that users agree to arbitrate all claims, along with a clause preventing users from launching class actions against the crypto exchange.
“The Court should hold that Plaintiffs are required to arbitrate claims that accrued after Feb. 20, 2019, even if the Court adheres to its initial decision as to claims that accrued before then and that the class-action waiver in the 2019 Terms of Use is enforceable for all of…</span>

                              <span>Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan, said his bank will soon allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, but it won’t custody the cryptocurrency.
“We are going to allow you to buy it,” Dimon said at JPMorgan’s annual investor day on May 19. “We’re not going to custody it. We’re going to put it in statements for clients.”
CNBC reported that Dimon also remarked on his long-held skepticism about crypto assets, pointing to their use in money laundering, sex trafficking and terrorism.
“I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin,” he said.

JPMorgan will offer clients access to Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), CNBC reported, citing sources familiar with the situation. Until now, the firm has limited its crypto exposure primarily to futures-based products, not direct ownership of digital assets.

JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley has also moved to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs to qualifying clients. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have seen significant adoption, with almost $42 billion in total aggregate inflows since they launched in January 2024. 
Dimon’s Bitcoin bashing history
Dimon has long been skeptical of Bitcoin, labeling it a scam that he had no interest in buying in 2018 and calling it “worthless” during the 2021 crypto bull market.
“I’ve always been deeply opposed to crypto, Bitcoin, etc.,” he said during a Senate Banking Committee hearing in 2023. “The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers, money laundering, tax avoidance.”
“If I were the government, I’d close it down,” he said.
At the 2024 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon said Bitcoin “does nothing. I call it the pet rock,” which came after the asset topped $100,000 for the first time.

The US Senate has voted to advance a key stablecoin-regulating bill after Democratic senators blocked an earlier attempt to move the bill forward over concerns about President Donald Trump’s sprawling crypto empire.
A key procedural vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, passed in a 66-32 vote on May 19 local time.
Several Democrats, including Mark Warner, Adam Schiff and Ruben Gallego, changed their votes to pass the motion to invoke cloture, which will now set the bill up for debate on the Senate floor.
Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the bill’s key backers, said on May 15 that she thinks it’s a “…</span>

“We believe that the release of Alpenglow will be a turning point for Solana. Alpenglow is not only a new consensus protocol, but the biggest change to Solana’s core protocol since, well, ever,” Anza’s Quentin Kniep, Kobi Sliwinski and Roger Wattenhofer said on May 19.

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio converges with gold’s, indicating similar risk-adjusted returns, supporting its store-of-value role.

Gold outperformed Bitcoin in Q1 2025 with a 30.33% price gain versus Bitcoin’s 3.84%, driven by economic uncertainty.

Bitcoin ETF inflows are recovering, and analysts predict BTC could reach $110,000–$444,000 in 2025.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is holding above $100,000, leading Fidelity Director of Global Macro, Jurrien Timmer to say the crypto asset could reclaim its position as a leading store-of-value contender.

                              <span>The US Department of Justice is reportedly conducting a probe over Coinbase’s contracted customer service agents in India, who accepted bribes in exchange for allowing criminals access to user data.
According to a May 19 Bloomberg report, DOJ investigators are looking into the data breach, which Coinbase disclosed to the public on May 15. The exchange reported that a group of customer support contractors — subsequently fired — “abused their access to [...] systems to steal the account data for a small subset of customers.”
“We have notified and are working with the DOJ and other US and international law enforcement agencies and welcome law enforcement’s pursuit of criminal charges against these bad actors,” said Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, according to Bloomberg.

Though “no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed” according to Coinbase, the data breach resulted in social engineering attacks targeting users, including a Sequoia Capital partner, with losses estimated at up to $400 million. The attackers also attempted to extort $20 million from Coinbase in exchange for not disclosing the breach, which the company refused.
Backlash in the courts
The attempted social engineering attacks have resulted in Coinbase users filing several lawsuits against the exchange, alleging that the company mishandled their personal data. One user, a retired artist named Ed Suman, reported losing $2 million to the scammers.
Coinbase’s stock price fluctuated following the news of the breach and an unrelated probe from the US Securities and Exchange Commission over its reported “verified user” numbers. Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin buying in the spot and futures markets helped BTC price keep its upward momentum despite $170 million in margin liquidations.

Weak stablecoin demand in China and the limited use of futures leverage suggest Bitcoin’s current rally is sustainable.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has displayed strength at the $102,000 support level on May 19, following the $170 million in liquidations of leveraged positions. The abrupt $5,000 correction after hitting $107,090 may have been unexpected, but it does not mean the odds of reaching an all-time high in the near term are lower, especially since Bitcoin derivatives metrics have shown resilience.

                              <span>Quantum Biopharma has purchased an additional $1 million worth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the Canadian biotechnology company said. 
The buys take Quantum’s total cryptocurrency holdings to approximately $4.5 million, according to a May 19 press release. The biotech company plans to stake a portion of its crypto to generate revenue. 
Quantum expects that holding a treasury of Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets will “provide a return on investment for shareholders and […] provide some hedge against the Canadian dollar,” it said. 
Shares of Quantum’s stock, QNTM, rose by approximately 25% following the announcement, according to data from Google Finance.

In prepared remarks for a May 19 speech, Atkins said it was a “new day” for the crypto industry under the current leadership of the SEC. He suggested that the financial regulator  would be more open to “adapt to and accommodate new developments” while still abiding by its statutes.
“The crypto markets have been languishing in SEC limbo for years,” said Atkins, adding:

“While I have directed Commission staff across our policy Divisions to begin drafting rule proposals related to crypto, the staff continue to ‘clear the brush’ through staff-level statements.”

The Canary CRO Trust will hold the Cronos (CRO) token in a regulated fund wrapper, Crypto.com said, adding that the trust is not an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and is only available to accredited investors. 
Creating regulated funds such as CRO Trust is part of Crypto.com’s plan for “further mainstreaming crypto,” Eric Anziani, president and chief operating officer of Crypto.com, said in a statement.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) attempt to challenge the all-time high faced a strong rejection near $107,100 on May 19, signaling that the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. However, the long tail on the candlestick shows solid buying at lower levels.

Now, with the US dollar depreciating against Bitcoin, borrowing against Bitcoin instead of selling it has become a more viable strategy.
“Prior to Bitcoin, my most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with dollars,” di Bartolomeo told Cointelegraph in an exclusive interview at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. 
“I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.
The arrival of Bitcoin-backed loans means investors can now effectively implement the same strategy by using a harder currency as collateral.

Bitcoin recovered from its sharp sell-off from $107,000, suggesting it functions as a hedge against uncertainty for investors reacting to Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt.

Moody’s downgraded the US credit rating to Aa1, citing a $36 trillion debt and rising deficits, causing market turbulence and a spike in US Treasury yields.

Despite short-term pressure from macroeconomic shifts, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook remains bullish due to cautious shorting and a weakening US dollar.

Bitcoin (BTC) price faced a sharp 4% correction during the Asian trading session on May 19, tumbling from an “important level” as noted by Glassnode. The data analytics platform indicated that Bitcoin’s surge stalled just below $106,600, a critical level where 31,000 BTC are held. This supply clus…</span>

Bitcoin price fell 1.4% to $102,460 amid US economic concerns, with daily trading volume up 94%, indicating the return of sellers.

Historically, these countries haven’t been top of mind for global crypto firms — though Kazakhstan did have a brief moment in the spotlight as a go-to destination for Bitcoin (BTC) miners after China’s mining ban.
Meanwhile, established financial centers are now in a race to become the world’s leading crypto hub by finding the right balance of regulation, talent, capital and infrastructure.
Here’s how five of them are backing their crypto dreams.

A new wave of crypto fundraising is emerging, changing how Web3 projects launch and who can invest at an early stage: Community Sales. At first glance, community sales may seem reminiscent of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era from 2016–2017. Yet, they represent a significant evolution that better aligns with crypto&#x27;s core values of democratization, transparency, and inclusivity.
Projects should include community sales as a core element of their fundraising strategy, besides raising from angel investors and VCs. Professional investors should embrace community sales as they highly increase the chances of sustainable success of Web3 projects.

The new solution, dubbed Payroll Treasury Yield, uses blockchain lending protocols to help firms earn returns on payroll funds that would otherwise sit idle, the company told Cointelegraph in an exclusive statement.
Franklin said its new offering integrates Summer.fi, a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, to allow companies to deposit stablecoin-denominated payroll reserves into smart contract-based lending pools.
These funds are lent to vetted borrowers, and companies earn yields while retaining access to their capital. Companies maintain full custody throughout the process, and smart contracts used are audited to reduce risk.

What is liquidation in crypto trading?
In cryptocurrency trading, liquidation happens when an exchange forcefully closes a trader&#x27;s leveraged position due to insufficient margin to pay losses. This usually occurs when the market moves sharply against the position.
