                              <span>Content moderation is critical in user-generated platforms. Whether you&#x27;re running a social app, marketplace, or community site, you need to filter out inappropriate, violent, or malicious media—without compromising on performance.
In this guide, we’ll walk through how to build a scalable image moderation pipeline using:
✅ Virus scanning with ClamAV

🖼️ Multi-size conversion via Sharp

🧠 NSFW detection via Google Vision API or NudeNet

🔐 Private file storage in MinIO

📦 Asynchronous job handling with BullMQ

🧬 Known-bad image matching via perceptual hashing



Let’s build it, step by step.
Problem: Don’t immediately expose uploaded images to the public or other users. What if they’re dangerous or explicit?

                              <span>Hey there! 
Amazon Q CLI. In this blog post, I&#x27;ll walk you through everything you need to create your own version of the game, including setup, game mechanics, and running the project on Windows.
Install Python(if you don’t have it already):
python.org and make sure to check the box to add Python to your system’s PATH during installation.
Install AWS CLI using pip:
pip install awscli

Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:
aws configure

You’ll need to provide your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, which you can get from the AWS Console.
Install Amazon Q CLI:
pip install amazon-q-cli

Verify the installation:
q --version

Start Amazon Q CLI by running:
q chat

In the chat, ask:
Can you help me make a Flappy Bird game using Pygame?
I wanted my Flappy Bird clone to have the following features:
Menu State: A welcoming main menu where the player can start the game.
Playing State: The player controls the bird’s jump.
Result State: When the game ends, the player can restart.
Let’s talk about how the game works under the hood:
Bird Movement: The bird continuously falls due to gravity, but when the player presses Space, the bird jumps!
Pipe Generation: Pipes randomly appear from the right side and move leftward at a constant speed.
Collision Detection: The bird collides with pipes or the ceiling/floor, ending the game if either happens.
Now, let’s get this game up and running. Here’s how you can set up the game on your own machine:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/afnank070/flappy-bird-amazon-q-cli

Navigate to the Project Folder:
cd flappy-bird-python

Install Pygame:
pip install pygame

Run the Game:
flappy_bird.py

Final Thoughts
Building this game was an absolute blast! Amazon Q CLI really sped up the development process.
If you&#x27;re new to game development or want to make your own version of Flappy Bird, I highly recommend giving this a try.</span>

As part of this tutorial, I will also show detailed screenshots annotated using Screenpresso at each step to make the process clear and easy to follow.
This guide is perfect for beginners using AWS Free Tier who want to deploy a simple web server manually.
Prerequisites
✅ A valid AWS Free Tier account.
✅ Git Bash installed on your local machine (Windows).
✅ Basic understanding of web servers and SSH.
Step 1: Log In to the AWS Management Console
First, we need to log in to our AWS account.
Open your web browser and go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
Enter your login credentials and sign in.
Why this is important:The AWS Console is the web interface that allows you to manage all AWS services

                              <span>Fellow developers, we need to talk about tutorial hell.
Not the coding kind - the entrepreneurship kind.
I&#x27;ve spent 3 months in startup tutorial hell. Every framework, every methodology, every &#x27;proven system&#x27; for building a business. I could probably teach a course on startup theory at this point.
But theory doesn&#x27;t ship products. Theory doesn&#x27;t get customers. Theory doesn&#x27;t generate revenue.
So today I&#x27;m switching from learning to building. One roadmap, one focus, public accountability.
This isn&#x27;t another &#x27;follow my journey&#x27; post. This is documentation for my future self and anyone else stuck in the same cycle.
The plan: build something, measure what matters, iterate based on real feedback from real users.
Revolutionary, I know.
First commit coming tomorrow. Time to write some code that actually solves a problem instead of just following along with tutorials.
Who&#x27;s with me?</span>

                              <span>Hi there! I&#x27;m Maneshwar. Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a first-of-its-kind tool that helps you automatically index API endpoints across all your repositories. LiveAPI makes it easier to discover, understand, and interact with APIs in large infrastructures.
NGINX is a powerful and versatile web server, and its extensibility through modules is one of its greatest strengths. 
Sometimes, however, you need functionality that isn&#x27;t available out-of-the-box or as a pre-compiled dynamic module. 
This is where custom NGINX modules come in.
In this blog post, we&#x27;ll walk through a real-world scenario: building NGINX with the ngx_http_consul_backend_module and the ngx_devel_kit (NDK) module. 
We&#x27;ll leverage Ansible to automate the entire process, making it repeatable, reliable, and dev-friendly.

                              <span>As part of my journey into leadership in the DevOps space, I recently walked through ten common but complex scenarios that a DevOps Team Lead might face.
Note: These scenarios were generated by ChatGPT at my request as part of preparing for a DevOps Team Lead interview. The answers and strategies are entirely my own, reflecting how I would handle each situation.
Challenge: Two junior engineers were constantly blocking senior engineers with minor requests.
Approach: I initiated 1:1s to understand their blockers and assess if the tasks assigned to them matched their current skill level. I discovered they often lacked confidence or context. To balance support and senior focus time, I introduced scheduled daily sync slots for juniors to raise their questions in batches. I also encouraged them …</span>

Java 8+
Kafka 3.x (includes Zookeeper)
A terminal like Command Prompt, Git Bash, or PowerShell
Go to: https://kafka.apache.org/downloads
Choose a binary (e.g., Kafka 3.6.0 with Scala 2.13)
Extract it to C:\kafka
Kafka uses Zookeeper for managing brokers. In a terminal:
cd C:\kafka

Keep this terminal open.
Open a new terminal:
cd C:\kafka

Kafka is now running on localhost:9092.
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
You can use Spring Initializr with the following settings:
Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring for Apache Kafka
Name: kafka-demo
Package: com.example.kafkademo

Framework
Dependency Model
Async Runtime
Middleware Support
SSE/WebSocket
Routing Matching Capability




Hyperlane
Only depends on Tokio + Standard Library
Tokio
✅ Supports request/response
✅ Native support
✅ Supports regular expressions


Actix-Web
Many internal abstraction layers
Actix
✅ Request middleware
Partial support (requires plugins)

                              <span>Regular Expression or Regex is basically a tool which we use to find pattern or find word, character or sentence in sequence of character. Here is the analogy:
You have been an overflowing inbox of emails and you want specific email to show up your criteria for it is:
Find all emails with meeting.
Find all emails with dollar amount.
Spot all the emails which contains word like URGENT and IMPORTANT.
Now you can&#x27;t open email one by one because it will take forever. So you decided setup a Smart Filter using rules like:
If emails contains &#x27;$&#x27; sign then it must be finance show me.
If emails have date or word like meeting show me.
If subject contains ‘URGENT’ followed by ! marks, show me.
It acts like a smart filter for text — scanning through messy, unstructured language and pulling out what you’re interested in, based on patterns.
In coming lecture I will be explaining about regex.</span>
