                              <span>Let’s be honest: How many of you have been managing IT assets using…spreadsheets?
Spreadsheets work, that’s true. But spreadsheets will no longer be useful if you have an increasing number of assets, which, even worse, need to be updated frequently, daily, hourly, to match the company workflow. At this point, you will need a proper IT asset management tool to handle the tasks.
This is where IT asset management (ITAM) cloud software steps in. In 2025, these cloud-based tools are more powerful than ever, leveraging automation, real-time insights, and accessibility to streamline operations, ensure compliance, and cut costs.
In this article, we’ll compare the top five IT asset management cloud software solutions for 2025. We’ll explore their key features, pricing, and the types of organization…</span>

Let’s not sugarcoat it.
Most developers use Python like it’s a glorified calculator. Maybe some API calls here, some pandas magic there. Cool.
But under the surface—in the depths of GitHub repos, hacker forums, and forgotten mailing lists—there are Python scripts that break the rules of what software is supposed to do.
We&#x27;re talking about:
Tools built for black-ops automation

Scripts that crawl government datasets for anomalies
Code that repurposes video game engines to train AI agents
Full-stack apps written in under 100 lines

Python bots that earn passive income 24/7

One night, I dreamt of a web app.

true.
So I woke up and built it anyway.
In Python.
This is a story of what happens when you throw out UX, logic, and reason — and let your subconscious become the product manager.
The dream app was called &quot;Whispers.&quot;
It had no homepage.
It had no navigation.
You could only use it by guessing routes.
Each route gave you a cryptic message like:
“The crow knows when the POST arrives.”
If you POSTed at the right moment, a new page would appear.
If not, you were sent to a 404 void — a blank page with a pulsing red dot.
And the dot?

There’s a war happening right under our noses.
It’s local business owners vs. the digital chaos they never asked for:
$89/month for a site they can’t edit
Agencies charging $2,000 for a WordPress theme from 2015
Contact forms that never send emails
Phone numbers that don’t click on mobile
SEO spam with zero leads
And the worst part?
These are good people.
A few months ago, I brought my car to a mechanic in my area — let’s call him Joe.

Cross-compiling Go code can be an intimidating task for beginners, especially when you&#x27;re trying to compile code on one operating system (such as Windows) for another (like Linux). This article will walk you through the steps needed to successfully cross-compile your Go applications from Windows to a Linux environment. You&#x27;ll learn about the necessary environment flags to set and how to troubleshoot common errors like unsupported GOOS/GOARCH pair.
Why Cross-Compilation is Useful
Cross-compilation is essential for developers who want to deploy their applications on different platforms without needing to switch environments. For instance, building server-side applications that run on Linux while developing on a Windows machine can save time and increase productivity. Go makes th…</span>

Back then, payments were chaos. Especially if you were a business owner juggling transactions across different channels. Card declines, chargebacks, fraud alerts, a payment terminal that needed to be restarted every full moon—it was enough to make you nostalgic for bartering with goats.
And then came AI.
I’ll admit, I was skeptical. “AI in payment processing?” I scoffed. “What’s it going to do—swipe the card for me?”
Turns out, yes. And so much more.
Before we dive into the AI magic, let’s take a moment to remember how bad it used to be.

Embarking on a mentorship journey is a powerful way to accelerate your growth—both personally and professionally. A successful mentorship provides guidance, insight, and support to help you overcome challenges, build confidence, and reach your goals. But the value you gain depends heavily on your own engagement, initiative, and mindset.
To get the most out of your mentoring experience, approach it with clear goals, open communication, and a proactive attitude. The following strategies will help you make the most of your mentorship relationship.
Mentorship without a sense of direction can quickly lose momentum. Setting well-defined goals provides clarity for both you and your mentor.

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. 
Strength in scarcity
Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically se…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin defied expectations in April, delivering double-digit gains while posting lower volatility than major traditional assets.
According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.
The Nasdaq Composite is flat, the Bloomberg Dollar Index fell nearly 4%, and even gold (typically a safe haven) briefly hit $3,500 per ounce before pulling back to a 5.75% gain, Galaxy Digital analys…</span>

                              <span>Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko proposed a new data availability (DA) solution to improve persistent fragmentation and lack of interoperability across blockchain networks.
In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

In a May 13 announcement, Tether said its gold-backed token, Tether Gold (XAUt), has been listed on Thai exchange Maxbit.
According to an X announcement by Maxbit, the platform is the first in Thailand to offer a “tokenized gold pair backed by physical gold.”
Launched in January 2020, Tether Gold is a gold-backed digital asset with a market cap of $802 million, with each XAUt representing ownership of one troy ounce of gold.
Thailand greenlighted stablecoins like Tether USDt in March
Tether Gold’s entrance in the Thai cryptocurrency market follows other notable stablecoin-related regulatory developments in the country.
In March, the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission approved US dollar-backed stablecoins such as Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across Thailand.

Launched in October 2023, Maxbit is a licensed digital asset exchange based in Thailand, operating under the oversight of the Thai SEC.
According to official SEC records, Thai energy conglomerate PTG Energy is the largest shareholder of Maxbit, with a 35% stake in the firm. Other Maxbit backers include two local private firms, Spearhead Labs and Unit Company, holding 29% and 28.7% in the digital asset business.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Canberra during a May 12 press conference that Charlton would be the new assistant minister for science, technology and the digital economy, working with Tim Ayres, the minister for industry and innovation. 
Ayres and Charlton will administer policies and programs promoting advancements in emerging technologies, science, technology, innovation and the digital economy, according to Albanese.

Jenner had escaped a class-action lawsuit from buyers of her self-titled memecoin, Caitlyn Jenner (JENNER) after California District Court Judge Stanley Blumenfeld Jr. said in a motion filed on May 9 that it was “sufficient to conclude that all nine causes of action are deficient” and sided with Jenner in dismissing the suit in its entirety for failure to state a claim.
He allowed the class group to amend its suit, which must be filed by May 23, but warned it had “to be more focused and judiciously pleaded” than the original.

                              <span>A British High Court has issued a restraining order against computer scientist Craig Wright preventing him from filing further defamation suits. 
In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.

Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

While terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, it reflects an accelerating number of acquisitions between crypto and TradFi firms in recent months.

Dogecoin&#x27;s 38% surge reflects strong market demand, with spot-buyer volumes taking charge since March. 

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.

Dogecoin&#x27;s (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). 
The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been &quot;taker bu…</span>

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has warned that a hacker has again hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website.  
In the second attack on its infrastructure in a week, the “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” the team said in a May 12 warning to X.
In a follow-up post to a user asking whether it was a hack or a hijack, the Curve Team said the website “Points to the wrong IP” when users try to visit. A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses.

                              <span>Aave, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has reached a new record of funds onchain, according to data from DefiLlama.
In an X post, Aave said it topped $40.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) on May 12. Onchain data reveals that Aave v3, the latest version of the protocol, has approximately $40 billion in TVL. 
Aave is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users borrow cryptocurrency by depositing other types of cryptocurrency as collateral. Meanwhile, lenders earn yield from borrowers. 
“With these milestones, Aave is proving its dominance in the Lending Space,” DeFi analyst Jonaso said in a May 12 X post. TVL represents the total value of cryptocurrency deposited into a protocol’s smart contracts.

In a May 12 X post, the TRUMP memecoin project said it would stop considering additional purchases for a dinner with the president, adding that the top tokenholders had been notified to apply for background checks if they wanted to attend. 
According to data provided on the project’s leaderboard, the top 220 wallets held more than 13.7 million tokens as of May 12, worth roughly $174 million at the time of publication.

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

In a May 12 filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, prosecutors recommended Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentence Council to two years in prison for his role in posting a message to the social media platform X suggesting that the SEC had approved spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time in January 2024.

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.
