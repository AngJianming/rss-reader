                              <span>The SOLID principles are the cornerstone of good software design. Whether you&#x27;re building small applications or large enterprise systems in .NET, applying these principles can help you write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
In this article, we&#x27;ll explore each of the SOLID principles with practical C# examples in the .NET ecosystem.
SOLID is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles:
S – Single Responsibility Principle
O – Open/Closed Principle
L – Liskov Substitution Principle
I – Interface Segregation Principle
D – Dependency Inversion Principle
These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and have become a standard for writing clean and maintainable software.

                              <span>Hey DEV community,
I&#x27;m a student in Nigeria, and I’m currently building Sentimind — an open-source AI-powered mental health platform that provides emotional support, intelligent recommendations, and a safe space for users to express themselves.
The idea came from watching so many people around me struggle silently with their mental health — not because they wanted to, but because help was inaccessible, expensive, or stigmatized.
What I&#x27;m building:
Real-time mood detection via AI
Personalized guidance for mental wellness
Fully private, ethical architecture
A 24/7 always-on digital companion
Tech Stack: Python, React, TensorFlow (coming soon), Google Cloud (hopefully!)
contactsentimind@gmail.com
I’m doing this with $0 funding, no team yet, and just pure commitment to the mission. If you&#x27;re into ethical AI, wellness tech, or want to support a young founder building from scratch, let’s connect.
Looking for:
Feedback on the project
Mentorship
Collaborators (designers, developers, researchers)
Cloud credits or hosting help
Thanks for reading. Let&#x27;s build something that truly helps people.

Ever found your trusty relational database groaning under the weight of modern application demands? You&#x27;re not alone. Scaling, managing schema changes, and ensuring consistent, low-latency performance for today&#x27;s global, high-traffic applications can feel like an uphill battle with traditional systems.
Enter Amazon DynamoDB, AWS&#x27;s flagship NoSQL key-value and document database. It&#x27;s built from the ground up for the cloud, designed for virtually limitless scale, and powers some of the world&#x27;s largest applications (think parts of Amazon.com itself!). If you&#x27;re building serverless applications, microservices, gaming backends, or anything requiring predictable high performance, DynamoDB is a service you need to know.
In this comprehensive guide, I&#x27;ll dissect DynamoDB&#x27;s…</span>

Right now, I’m building LiveAPI, a first of its kind tool for helping you automatically index API endpoints across all your repositories. LiveAPI helps you discover, understand and use APIs in large tech infrastructures with ease.
Go maps are a core part of the language, offering a flexible way to store key-value pairs. They&#x27;re simple to use at a basic level, but there&#x27;s a lot more power under the hood if you know how to tap into it. This article dives into advanced techniques for using Go maps effectively, with practical examples and tips to level up your code. Whether you&#x27;re optimizing performance or handling edge cases, these methods will help you write cleaner, faster, and more reliable Go programs.

This situation can be frustrating, especially when you have a persistent navigation bar and want to maintain the state of your views. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore why scroll position loss happens and provide a step-by-step guide to solving this problem using PageStorageKey and AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin.
Why Does Scroll Position Loss Occur?
There are several reasons why your GridView can lose its scroll position when switching views. One common reason is due to the way Flutter handles widget states during navigation. When you navigate away from a view, Flutter may dispose of the widget tree associated with that view if it…</span>

What this does: Loops through a folder and renames all .txt files
Python can read and write Excel files easily using openpyxl.
Example: Update Prices in Excel Sheet

Useful for: Small business owners, accountants, and data analysts.
Python can send emails using Gmail, Outlook, or other SMTP servers.
Example: Send a Custom Email

Tip: Use an App Password for Gmail (2FA must be enabled).
Use Selenium to automate web form submissions, scraping, and testing.
Example: Auto-Login to a Website

Popular for: Social media automation, job applications, testing.
Extract useful data from websites — like prices, headlines, or job listings.
Example: Scrape News Headlines

Great for bloggers, researchers, marketers, and students.
Control your keyboard and mouse with Python!
Example: Open Notepad and Type a Message



Warning: This interacts with your live desktop — use with care!
Once your automation script is ready, you can schedule it to run daily using:
Example: Add to Windows Task Scheduler
 Save your script as report.py
 Open Task Scheduler → Create Basic Task
In 2025, automating daily tasks with Python is easier than ever. Whether you’re a student, developer, small business owner, or just someone who hates doing repetitive stuff — Python gives you the power to:

One such package is &#x27;distutils_hack&#x27;. In this article, we&#x27;ll discuss what this module is, why it appears, and whether it&#x27;s something you need to be worried about.
What is &#x27;distutils_hack&#x27;?
&#x27;distutils_hack&#x27; is a module related to Python&#x27;s packaging system, particularly the way that Python handles installations and distributions of packages. It acts as a compatibility layer for the standard library&#x27;s distutils module, which is used for packaging Python projects.
When you see &#x27;distutils_hack&#x27; on your pip list, it’s typically an indication that you have installed a package that has a dependency on it, even if you don&#x27;t remember adding it directly.

                              <span>The Lido Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), the entity that governs the Lido liquid staking protocol, has initiated an emergency vote to rotate a compromised oracle — a bridge that connects real-world data to blockchain systems.
According to members of the Lido DAO, an address belonging to the Chorus One oracle was compromised, and the Ether (ETH) balance associated with that oracle was drained in an incident still being investigated.
Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.
ETH&#x27;s “up band” target is around $10,000

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

Bitcoin analysis identifies the all-important price point to hold into the weekly close as all-time highs loom.


Liquidity is tightly clustered around current spot price, with $106,000 the likely next battleground.

Some traders are expecting the bid to enter price discovery to fail.

Bitcoin (BTC) preserved giant gains into the May 11 weekly close as analysis flagged the key level to hold next.

Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.
Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”

“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…</span>

According to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million.
El Salvador&#x27;s Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases.

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the &quot;loss of chance&quot; claim made against Binance for delisting the token, should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages, in the original case.
The investors continue to claim that Binance&#x27;s 2019 delisting of BSV and similar major exchange delistings are the primary drivers of BSV&#x27;s long-term price decline and its failure to attract the investor atte…</span>

&quot;Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell,&quot; the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. &quot;Strategy&#x27;s holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders,&quot; Ju continued.
Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, is an outspoken Bitcoin advocate who evangelizes the scarce digital currency to potential investors and has inspired many other companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury plan.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…</span>

The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

Under the proposed rules, crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks.
Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

                              <span>Strategy founder Michael Saylor says Bitcoin hasn’t reached $150,000 yet because holders without a long-term outlook have been selling off while a new cohort of investors are beginning to enter the market.
“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

According to data from DEX Screener, DOOD’s market cap fell from over $100 million shortly after launch to around $60 million at the time of writing.
Overall, the much-anticipated airdrop was “[d]efinitely underwhelming,” a crypto commentator said in a May 9 X post.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana&#x27;s 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

                              <span>Wall Street giant BlackRock met with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Crypto Task Force to discuss staking within crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) and tokenization of securities. The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.
According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.
Other crypto ETF issuers share that view. On Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to introduce staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. In April, the SEC delayed a decision…</span>

                              <span>US Vice President JD Vance will speak at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, roughly a year after then-presidential candidate Donald Trump spoke at the same event.
According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. 
Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning.
Though Vance is a Bitcoin (BTC) holder — he holds $250,000 to $500,001 worth of the cryptocurrency, according to a financial disclosure filed in…</span>

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.
