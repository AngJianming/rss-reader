To assist other developers, I have designed a portfolio website using Next, Tailwind CSS, and EmailJS. In this article, I will provide a step-by-step guide on the setup process, along with the GitHub link.
Here is the live preview:

STEP 01:
git clone https://github.com/swarupinfotech/developer-portfolio.git
cd developer-portfolio

STEP 02:
npm or yarn.
npm install
# or
yarn


After installation, all packages, Now change all data on utils/data/* according to you. For example:
export const personalData &#x3D; {
  name: &quot;Swarup Mahato&quot;,
  profile: &#x27;/profile.png&#x27;,

  Why I Built It


Over the years, juggling roles as a developer, marketer, and data wrangler, I noticed one recurring pain point:
Working with CSV files always takes longer than it should.
Cleaning, converting, merging, analyzing — the workflows were always fragmented across different sites or scripts. Most existing tools were:
Slow and clunky
Feature-limited
Hidden behind logins or paywalls
So I built CSVToolsOnline.com — a complete toolkit that just works, in-browser, and does 95% of what people need from CSVs.
Whether you&#x27;re a developer, marketer, student, or someone who just dreads opening Excel — here’s what you’ll find:

Whether you’re at a fork in the road or just getting curious, this series is for you. Week 1 will be about exploring (experimentation, choosing a growth theme), Week 2 we&#x27;ll focus on becoming visible and taking initiative, while the final week is about claiming growth (or moving away) and choosing your own path. Join me on this journey!
Ever feel weird about talking about your own work?
Like if you post a small win, someone’s going to roll their eyes?

Or that “real devs” don’t need to say they’re growing, they just are?
Yeah. Been there.

In this guide, we&#x27;ll explore how to build a robust serverless application using AWS CDK with ECS Fargate and DynamoDB.
The serverless paradigm has transformed how we think about application deployment. By combining ECS Fargate for containerized compute with DynamoDB for managed NoSQL storage, we create an architecture that scales automatically, reduces operational overhead, and optimizes costs. 
The AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) makes this entire setup reproducible and maintainable through code.

                              <span>Ever wished you could quickly go through your lengthy PDF notes just before an exam or review session?
What if you could upload a PDF and instantly get a neat bullet-point summary?
Sounds magical, right? 🪄 Well, it’s possible — thanks to the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the simplicity of Streamlit. Let&#x27;s build an interactive AI Notes Summarizer that combines Python, Streamlit, and Google&#x27;s Gemini API to create intelligent, readable summaries of your PDFs.
Python – The base programming language


Streamlit – For building the web interface


PyMuPDF (fitz) – For PDF text extraction


Google Gemini API – To generate bullet-point summaries

Pull down to refresh

The Cangjie development language directly provides a pull-down Refresh component called Refresh, which is also very convenient to use:
@State var headerLoading : Bool &#x3D; false; 

Refresh(RefreshParams(refreshing: @Binder(this.headerLoading))) {
List{
        ForEach(this.carList,
        itemGeneratorFunc:{

One of PostgreSQL&#x27;s most underrated features is its support for transactional DDL (Data Definition Language). In PostgreSQL, you can wrap schema changes in transactions and roll them back if something goes wrong. Even better, PostgreSQL supports savepoints within DDL transactions for fine-grained control.
