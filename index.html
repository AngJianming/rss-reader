In that series, we created a custom MCP server that can help you manage your AWS resources. Then we added a RAG knowledge base and some utilities to the server so that it could have domain-specific knowledge of an AWS service to help us quickly learn and prototype new applications. Lastly, we created a custom MCP client that used the tools exposed by the MCP server to invoke Claude 3.7 Sonnet via Amazon Bedrock. Creating a custom MCP client was a good exercise to learn about MCP and Amazon Bedrock, but in reality our MCP server could be used with any client that supports MCP servers. Today we&#x27;ll look at how to integrate the custom MCP server that we previ…</span>

This post provides a deep dive into token sale strategies that have transformed blockchain project funding. We explore the history, variations, benefits, challenges, and future outlook of ICOs, STOs, and IEOs. With clear explanations, tables, and bullet lists, readers will learn how token sales democratize investment, engage a global community, and drive innovation. We also link to authoritative resources like What is Blockchain? and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) to provide further context and actionable insights into the evolving funding landscape.
Blockchain technology continues to redefine finance, governance, and technology. One of its most groundbreaking innovations is the funding mechanism of token sales. These fundraising strategies have broken down barriers and provided …</span>

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been experimenting with automated trading setups, trying to reduce the need for manual chart watching. While working on a side project for a custom trading dashboard, I started looking into AI-based platforms that can handle the heavy lifting.
One tool that caught my attention is Trader AI — it offers automated trading based on real-time market analysis and claims to scan market trends 24/7. From what I’ve seen, it’s designed for both beginners and experienced traders.
This got me thinking:
I’d love to hear from anyone who has:
Tried to integrate with third-party trading tools via REST APIs or webhooks
Built alert systems or custom dashboards on top of external trading platforms
Faced limitations around authentication, rate limiting, or sandbox environments
If you’ve worked on something similar — or know of other open platforms that support developer integrations — drop your thoughts below! I’m especially curious how others are handling trade automation pipelines without violating TOS or running into API restrictions.</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Day 18 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today’s milestone is a major step toward real-world automation and system control: Bash scripting.
Whether you&#x27;re managing servers, running tasks, or automating builds — Bash scripting is the backbone of Linux efficiency.
Why Bash Scripting Matters
Your First Bash Script
Working with Variables
User Input in Scripts
Conditional Logic (if-else)
Loops: For and While
Functions in Bash
Try It Yourself
Real-World Bash Script Examples
Why This Matters
Bash scripting allows you to:
Automate repetitive manual work
Create scheduled maintenance jobs
Wrap complex Linux commands into one script
Respond to system conditions dynamically
Instead of typing 5 commands every day — you can run one script and be done.
Create the script
Add:
echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

Make it executable:

                              <span>Most people understand the need to secure their main website with SSL. But what about the subdomains — the blog, the store, the dashboard? If those parts of your site aren’t protected, you’re leaving the door wide open for security risks.
Securing subdomains is just as important as protecting your root domain, especially if they handle sensitive data like logins or transactions. Fortunately, you don’t need a separate certificate for each one. In this guide, we’ll break down how to get an SSL certificate for subdomains, explore the different types available (including wildcard options), and help you avoid common mistakes.
SSL (or more accurately, TLS — but most people still say SSL) encrypts the connection between your website and your visitors. It prevents data from being intercepted by ha…</span>

  Why this crushes “waiting-for-backend” blues




Parallel velocity – front-end keeps shipping while the server is still a Trello card.


QA automation – deterministic responses beat flaky staging DBs.


Demo power – stakeholders see real flows on demo day, not static mocks.

You only truly understand systems when you break them and fix them.
Some folks argue that production should be sacred, that failure is bad, and that “breaking things” is reckless. And yes, breaking actual production is never the goal. But if you’re serious about learning how systems behave under pressure (how they fail, recover, or silently corrupt data), then breaking things in a safe environment is one of the best teachers you’ll ever have.
When everything works, your mental model doesn’t get tested. You build a service, deploy it, and it runs. Cool. But what happens when:
a disk fills up?

DNS breaks?

a container gets OOM-killed?

your message queue reorders events?

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released another update on what he believes the future of the network should entail.
In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

                              <span>An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

                              <span>Crypto was born from an open-source ethos, where code was shared publicly, accessible for review and shaped by community contributions. Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.
But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…</span>

“Liquidation cascades could happen to any project in the crypto industry,” Mantra CEO John Mullin warned in the post, pointing to the role of “aggressive leverage positions” on exchanges as a broader threat to investor safety.

Vanar Chain is launching Neutron, an AI-native blockchain layer with data compression ratios of up to 500:1, which can reduce a standard 25 megabyte file to just 50 kilobytes, transforming it into a “Neutron Seed” that can be stored on the blockchain ledger.
The new blockchain compression layer aims to solve the industry’s data storage issue, with traditional blockchains lacking the capacity to store data, only to reference it.
This design introduces potential single points of failure. Vanar&#x27;s Neutron aims to solve this by enabling fully onchain, verifiable data storage.

According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph, Circle aims to pilot USDC (USDC) settlements within Onafriq’s vast network, which connects over 500 wallets and 200 million bank accounts in more than 40 countries.
“By integrating USDC, we aim to simplify financial transactions for institutions and individuals, reduce costs and strengthen trust,” Onafriq founder and CEO Dare Okoudjou said.

Bitcoin’s supply-and-demand dynamics, in addition to growing institutional adoption, position it as a potential hedge against inflation in 2025. However, its high volatility and centralization concerns mean it remains a speculative asset rather than a guaranteed safeguard against inflation.
What is inflation? 
Inflation refers to the general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. As prices rise, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Inflation is typically measured by indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average change in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods an…</span>

Set up your Pi Wallet and secure it with a 24-word seed phrase before transferring your coins.

KYC is often required on both CEXs and P2P platforms to transfer and sell Pi Coins.

You can sell Pi through CEXs or P2P platforms, each offering different security, speed and control.

Always do your own research (DYOR) before selling or holding, as expert opinions on Pi’s future vary.

If you’re here, you probably already know what Pi Coin is and just want to figure out how to sell it. However, a recap awaits, in case you need one. 
While the project pitches itself as a way to democratize crypto access through mobile mining, there are some major concerns that have been hard to ignore:

Bitcoin&#x27;s 28% rebound from $75,000 faces resistance at $95,000, risking a bull trap.

Strong spot price momentum and ETF inflows support a potential $100,000 push.

Bull flag pattern suggests a $108,300 target if BTC breaks the $95,000 resistance.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 28% from its five-month low below $75,000 reached on April 9. However, its failure to break above the $95,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the latest recovery may trap bulls.

Approving staking for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US may have a minimal impact on inflows unless Ether sees a sustained rally, says Eric Balchunas

ETH dropped significantly in price after the launch of the ETFs last year, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw new all-time highs just two months after launching.

Balchunas said that for inflows to increase again, ETH would need a multimonth run and a strong narrative.

Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token’s price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

                              <span>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has filed lawsuits against the non-fungible token marketplace NFT Stars and the blockchain gaming firm Kurosemi, which operates as Delysium, accusing them of withholding tokens they owed.
The lawsuits, both filed in the Delaware bankruptcy court, alleged that NFT Stars and Delysium failed to deliver all the tokens paid for by FTX despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter.
FTX claimed in an April 28 statement that it made “numerous unanswered attempts” to engage with both firms, and it would be “contacting numerous other token and coin issuers regarding FTX assets and will be filing additional suits against non-responsive parties.”

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash.
BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.”

Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman said in an April 28 judgment that OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” sanctions.
Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.
“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

                              <span>Key points:

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. 
According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the…</span>

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the “Bitcoin Yardstick” metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …</span>

In its April 2025 Financial Stability Report, the Bank of Italy flags crypto volatility and rising integration with the broader economy, singling out stablecoins and non-financial firms’ crypto exposure as key concerns.
&quot;The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.
