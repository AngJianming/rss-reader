In 2025, users expect websites to load instantly—no matter where they are or what device they use. Edge computing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are the secret weapons that make this possible. Let’s explore how these technologies work together to deliver lightning-fast, reliable, and personalized web experiences.

Picture this: You want to modify your component. Your typical AI conversation goes like this:
You: &quot;Can you help me style my navbar?&quot;
AI: &quot;Sure! Can you share your navbar code?&quot;
You: *pastes 50 lines of JSX*
AI: &quot;What about the CSS?&quot;
You: *pastes another 100 lines*
AI: &quot;Where is this component used?&quot;
You: *explains folder structure*
AI: &quot;Can you describe what it currently looks like?&quot;
You: *tries to describe UI in words*
AI: *generates code*
You: &quot;That&#x27;s not what I wanted at all...&quot;

                              <span>Let’s first look at Ward Cunningham’s definition of “first-class citizens”:
If a programming language places no restrictions on the creation and use of a certain language element, and we can treat this syntactic element the same way we treat values, then we can call this syntactic element a “first-class citizen” in that programming language.
Simply put, in Go, functions can be assigned to variables.
A function can be passed as a parameter, used as a variable type, or as a return value.
In kube-proxy, the function type makeEndpointFunc is defined, with corresponding implementations in ipvs, nftables, and iptables.

Domain-centric architectures, like the Ports and Adapters, allow you to achieve just that.
The Ports and Adapters architecture, also known as Hexagonal architecture, was a concept started by Alistair Cockburn in 1994, but then officially written in his blog in 2005.
Its intention is:
Allow an application to equally be driven by users, programs, automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.
This connected to what we previously stated: isolating the business logic from everything external and that can be ever-changing.

Running through June 29, Frontend Challenge: June Celebrations will feature our beloved CSS Art prompt and a brand new prompt: Perfect Landing. 
Our theme is June Celebrations, designed to be all-encompassing and accessible as we celebrate everything from Father&#x27;s Day to Juneteenth to Pride Month. There is so much worth celebrating this month - did you know June also hosts National Nail Polish Day, National Hazelnut Cake Day, and so many more fun and quirky events?! We can&#x27;t wait to see what you share with us.
As with all Frontend Challenges, there will be one winner per prompt. That&#x27;s two chances to win bragging rights, a DEV++ membership, and an exclusive DEV badge!

                              <span>In a landscape where reasoning-focused LLMs often demand sky-high compute budgets and ultra-long context lengths, Fathom-R1-14B by Fractal AI stands out as an outstanding alternative. It is developed as part of the ambitious IndiaAI Mission to build the nation’s first Large Reasoning Model (LRM), and this 14B parameter model delivers state-of-the-art performance on Olympiad-grade mathematical reasoning tasks - all within a modest 16K context window and a shockingly low $499 post-training budget. Unlike models that rely on 32k+ token inference and massive fine-tuning pipelines, Fathom-R1-14B achieves scores of 52.71% on AIME25 and 35.26% on HMMT25, significantly outperforming comparable open-source models like o3-mini and Light-R1-14B. Moreover, it competes with proprietary giants like o4-m…</span>

                              <span>In the world of AI, especially with autonomous agents, one core idea gives them their abilities: the agent loop.
If you&#x27;ve ever wondered how AI systems stay on track, adapt to changes, and keep moving toward their goals without constant human input, the answer lies in this loop.
An agent loop is a cycle that enables an AI agent to keep working toward a goal. Think of it like a feedback loop in a smart assistant or a robot — a continuous process of observing, thinking, and acting.
Here’s how the loop generally works:
Observe (Gather Data)


The agent starts by collecting fresh information. This could be from:
Its memory
Tools it can access (like APIs or search engines)
Sensors (for physical agents)
Logs or databases
This step is about reading the world as it currently is, not as it was.

Fast forward a year, I had to switch away from Linux, and move back to Windows on my laptop, and I had only one. But the memory of Celluloid struck with me, and I was no longer satisfied with VLC. I needed a better one, and I found one very close. It was called KM Player.
Time passed. Life was happy with KM Player. Then I got a job. And I forgot about leisure time, so I had not touched it for straight six  months. One day, as our team just delivered the project we were working on, we were granted 2 weeks of paid leave. That ni…</span>

In this blog, you’ll learn about the dangers of a bad multi-currency setup and how you can solidify your multi-currency system for efficient cross-border payments using Flutterwave.
A multi-currency setup allows a business to display prices and accept payments from customers globally. This is important for businesses looking to sell products or services to customers in different countries, allowing them to shop and pay in a familiar currency.
With a multi-currency setup, customers can pay in their preferred currency, making shopping straightforward regardless of how prices are lis…</span>

It also supports binary backups through disk snapshots.
In this blog post, we will describe how to make a backup of FoundationDB via backup_agent. The FoundationDB operator supports making logical backups via backup_agent, but it does not support running DR with dr_agent. We decided to run backup_agent as a separate deployment to allow a symmetric setup with dr_agent.
In order to run the backup_agent pods, we will need a deployment. That deployment will need the following:
