                              <span>As usual, I received JSON data from the backend developer, but it was in a .txt file. I had to download it, copy the content, and paste it into an online formatter to view it properly.
Honestly, I was getting tired of this process, so I started looking for a more convenient solution. That’s when I stumbled upon a website that made things so much easier. If I want to share JSON data with someone, I can simply click &quot;Share&quot; to generate a link instead of sending a file. I just send the link to the other person, and even better, when they open it, the JSON data is already neatly formatted. I think this is absolutely awesome!

Additionally, the link has a one-hour expiration time, after which it becomes inaccessible, ensuring the data remains highly secure.
I continued exploring and discovered that it not only enables quick sharing but also allows you to rapidly generate an API for temporary testing during development. This is incredibly convenient!

Actually, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also run queries here to extract the data I need from the entire JSON dataset, supporting various query languages.

In addition to standard JavaScript code, it also supports JEMSPath, JSONPath, JQ Cmd 

Secondly, it also supports data conversion, allowing seamless transformation between JSON and other data formats, including JS Object, JSON5, JSON Schema,  Query String, Typescript,  Postman Bulk, MXL, YML.

You can manually convert data or directly paste non-JSON data, and it will automatically generate the converted JSON data. For example, you can simply paste the following data:
DEV


Additionally, it can validate whether the provided JSON data meets specific structural requirements, supporting JSON Schema and JSON Type Definition.

Another feature we frequently use is: JSON Diff

In short, I think this tool is an essential asset for programmers, and I’m sharing it with everyone here Online JSON Format Tool</span>

                              <span>Testing Android apps is challenging because the ecosystem is highly fragmented. Devices come in different screen sizes, hardware configurations, and Android versions, leading to inconsistencies in how apps behave. A feature that works smoothly on one phone might not function similarly on another due to manufacturer customizations, performance limitations, or OS-specific restrictions.
Network conditions add another layer of complexity. An app that loads quickly on Wi-Fi might become unresponsive on slow mobile data or in areas with weak signals. Security risks make things even more complicated, especially for apps handling sensitive data.

Integrating new versions of libraries can sometimes lead to unexpected issues. Based on recent experiences and common problems encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS v4 with SvelteKit, this guide focuses specifically on the recommended approach using the official Vite plugin.
We&#x27;ll cover the steps assuming you&#x27;re initializing your SvelteKit project with the npx sv create . CLI tool, which offers a convenient way to include Tailwind from the start.
Important Compatibility Note: Tailwind CSS v4 is designed for modern browsers: Safari 16.4+, Chrome 111+, Firefox 128+. If you need to support older browsers, please stick with v3.4 as v4 relies on modern CSS features like @property and color-mix().

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever faced the challenge of using a Bash script on Mac OS X Mavericks and encountered issues with directory paths containing spaces, you&#x27;re not alone. In this article, we&#x27;ll take a closer look at a common problem that arises when executing Bash scripts that require arguments with spaces, and how to resolve it effectively.
Why Does This Issue Occur?
When a Bash script accepts parameters from the command line, any spaces in the path can lead to misinterpretation of the provided argument. Bash treats spaces as delimiters, which separates the string into distinct arguments, resulting in errors when the script is executed. This is precisely what happens in your case when trying to open a folder that has spaces in its name.

Or perhaps a seemingly simple report that used to generate in seconds now spins endlessly, leaving users frustrated and management questioning your database prowess. Chances are, somewhere in the intricate dance of your application and database, a slow-performing SQL query is the culprit.
The first crucial step is to find those SQL queries that are consuming the most execution time. This can often be achieved by querying the database’s own performance-monitoring views and tools.

2. Now let’s convert it to use NgRx for state
First, assume you already have an NgRx store set up.

                              <span>Introduction
Connecting to a WebSocket server usually requires establishing a handshake over HTTP. While many HTTP client libraries allow you to set custom headers like Authorization, the native WebSocket API does not offer such functionality directly. So, how can you accomplish this when working with the WebSocket API on the web platform?
The Challenge with WebSocket API
The WebSocket API, implemented in browsers, is designed to simplify the connection process but lacks the ability to add custom headers including important ones like Authorization. This limitation can be a hurdle when you need to secure your WebSocket connections or add additional context to your request.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

                              <span>Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings (MARA) nearly tripled its Bitcoin holdings over 12 months, according to its newly released Q1 results.
However, its Bitcoin production fell, and total earnings slightly missed Wall Street estimates in Q1.
MARA, formerly Marathon Digital, saw its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings increase to 47,531 BTC, up 175% from the 17,320 BTC the firm was holding at the end of Q1 2024.
MARA holdings inch closer to $5B after Bitcoin pump
MARA holds the second-largest amount of Bitcoin among all publicly traded companies, according to CoinGecko data. Strategy (MSTR) holds the number one spot with 555,450 Bitcoin.
The holdings represent a total value of approximately $4.9 billion, based on Bitcoin’s current price of $102,660 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap dat…</span>

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump  administration’s tariffs.

                              <span>Tech company Meta is reportedly exploring integrating stablecoin payments into its platforms after a three-year hiatus from cryptocurrencies, Fortune reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether&#x27;s USDt (USDT), Circle&#x27;s USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

GENIUS stablecoin bill blocked in US Senate
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) of 2025 Act was blocked by Democrat lawmakers in the Senate on May 8, stalling the bill&#x27;s progress.
Although the bill initially received bipartisan support from US lawmakers, Democrats opposed the bill last minute due to concerns over President Donald Trump pushing crypto policies for self-benefit.

On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
&quot;Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

Whale accumulation continues, with the number of addresses holding 10,000+ XRP rising steadily on price dips.

XRP broke above a key falling wedge resistance, increasing the chances of a rally toward $2.80–$3.66.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

                              <span>Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

                              <span>Bitcoin has reclaimed the $100,000 price level for the first time since January, reflecting renewed bullish sentiment among investors.
Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

Unlike the previous $100,000 hits, the new price spike came as Bitcoin market dominance surged above 60%, reflecting potential bearish sentiment for altcoins.

In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…</span>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.

As the global economy shifts to a digital core, NODE offers active equity investment in real-world companies shaping that future. This ETF is actively managed, meaning a portfolio manager and not just an algorithm, selects the included stocks.
The ETF may allocate up to 25% of its assets to crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs) via a Cayman Islands subsidiary, providing indirect exposure to digital assets while adhering to US tax regulations. With a management fee of 0.69%, $NOD…</span>
