The Moment I Realized This Was Bigger Than Chatbots
But what exactly is an LLM? And why is everyone from startups to trillion-dollar companies building around them?
I&#x27;ve been playing with chatgpt and oneday I asked. &quot;can you write a business plan for an AI powered health app, for remote workers?&quot;  I expected some generic response. But it came up with the most detailed product description, revenue model, full marketing plan including competitive analysis+ user personas described by emoticons !!!&quot;

                              <span>In a significant leap forward for the advertising industry, Amazon has unveiled a revolutionary AI-powered video generation tool designed to help sellers create high-quality video ads within seconds. The announcement, made at the annual Amazon Ads Summit, signals a major shift in how businesses—big and small—will produce marketing content, removing traditional barriers like time, cost, and creative expertise.
This tool, still in phased rollout, uses advanced generative Artificial Intelligence to create product-centric video advertisements with just a few input prompts. It promises to radically simplify video ad production, especially for small sellers who lack in-house video teams or large advertising budgets.

Modern web development calls for close interaction with backend APIs. Frontend development might be stalled while waiting for backend APIs to be ready. Mocking helps close that gap, although maintaining mocks by hand becomes difficult, especially as APIs evolve. This is where the power of the Mock Service Worker (MSW) and the OpenAPI Specification (OAS) comes into play. This post will show how to automatically create MSW handlers using an OpenAPI spec, generate mock data, and add realistic delays to the mock server. 
This enables you to spin up accurate, realistic mocks with minimal manual effort and full alignment with your API contract, speeding up frontend development.

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a machine-readable contract for your API. You define everything up f…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone! My name is Vladyslav, but you can find me online as Metimol. I want to share the story behind my open-source project, BlackWave—a social network simulator where real users can interact with thousands of autonomous AI bots, each with a unique personality, memory, and behavior. It&#x27;s been a journey from a crazy idea to an unexpected collaboration, a complete tech-stack overhaul, and finally, a release.
It all started around May 15th. An idea struck me: what if I created a Twitter clone, but not for the masses? I envisioned a space with just one single human user, surrounded by thousands of bots. These bots would simulate real users: they&#x27;d follow the real person, like their posts, leave comments, and create the illusion of maximum engagement.

Note: A more broadly applicable and commonly-used IaC tool in the industry is Terraform. It’s a little less straightforward to use than SAM for an AWS serverless API, but many people prefer to use it for their project anyway. If you want to use Terraform instead of SAM, follow this guide.

The Reconmap team is busy at work with one thing in mind and one thing only. This thing is not adding new fancy features, or redesigning the whole UI, or integrating with the latest AI agents.
It&#x27;s tempting to keep adding features to products, but our users appreciate a robust and reliable product more than one that is full of features that break when they most need them.
This post is about configuration, and the improvements that we have made in this area are many:
Consistency. Our architecture has many components: the API, the Web UI, the CLI tool, the agent, amongst others. Each one of these components were using config in different ways: JSON files, JS files, ENV variables. Not only this, they were also naming identical config sections in different…</span>

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how a single click on your browser opens up an entire digital world? What magic turns a URL into a living, breathing, interactive web app? And what role does JavaScript play in this vast, invisible machinery?
Well, it all starts with a question—and curiosity like yours. Let’s dive into a fascinating story of how JavaScript was born, why it exists, and how it connects everything from HTML, CSS, and the DOM, all the way to servers, the internet, and you.
🧬 The Root Cause: Why Was JavaScript Created?
The world needed interactivity, and this demand became the root cause for a browser-based scripting language.
🔧 The Mission:
🧠 Enter Brendan Eich, who created JavaScript in 10 days in 1995. Initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript (for marketing re…</span>

                              <span>When dealing with multiple forms on a single page, especially when the forms contain duplicate input names, Laravel’s default validation approach can cause issues. By default, validation errors are tied to the input fields, meaning the error messages are displayed across all forms, not just the one that was submitted. This can be confusing for users.
To resolve this, we can use Named Error Bags, which allow us to store and display validation errors for specific forms separately:
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Validator;

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $validation &#x3D; Validator::make($request-&gt;all(), [
        &#x27;name&#x27;  &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required|min:25&#x27;,
        &#x27;email&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;required|unique:users,email,NULL,id,deleted_at,NULL&#x27;,
    ])-&gt;validateWithBag(&#x27;user&#x27;);

                              <span>Let’s explore some powerful Laravel pagination methods that supercharge your pagination functionality. First up is the withPath method in Laravel pagination, which customizes the URI used for pagination links:
use App\Models\User;

Route::get(&#x27;/users&#x27;, function () {
    // Original pagination link (without custom path)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page&#x3D;1
    $users &#x3D; User::paginate(15);

    // New pagination link (with custom path)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/admin/users?page&#x3D;1
    $users-&gt;withPath(&#x27;/admin/users&#x27;);
});

The appends method allows you to add additional query parameters to the existing pagination URL:
use App\Models\User;

Route::get(&#x27;/users&#x27;, function () {
    // Original pagination link
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page&#x3D;2
    $users &#x3D; User::paginate(15);

    // New pagination link (with the appended query string)
    // E.g., http://your_app.test/users?page&#x3D;2&amp;sort&#x3D;asc
    $users-&gt;appends([&#x27;sort&#x27; &#x3D;&gt; &#x27;asc&#x27;]);
});

In some cases, you may have multiple paginations on a single page. If you use numerous paginator instances without differentiation, they may conflict with each other. To resolve this, assign a unique name to each paginator instance:
// This will generate a URL like: https://example.com/users?foo&#x3D;3
User::where(&#x27;votes&#x27;, &#x27;&gt;&#x27;, 100)
    -&gt;paginate(perPage: 15, columns: [&#x27;*&#x27;], pageName: &#x27;foo&#x27;);

The onEachSide method allows you to customize the number of pagination links that are displayed before and after the current page link:
{{ $users-&gt;onEachSide(5)-&gt;links() }}

For over two years, a &quot;temporary&quot; bug has made it impossible to create test accounts for app reviews. This single, persistent failure has spiraled into an absurd and dangerous situation for developers around the world. The official workaround? Meta expects us to give strangers in other countries full, unmitigated access to our real, private Facebook accounts.
This isn&#x27;t just an inconvenience; it&#x27;s a fundamental breach of privacy and a security nightmare waiting to happen. I&#x27;ve spent weeks fighting it, and this is the guide I wish I had.
