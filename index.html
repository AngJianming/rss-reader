                              <span>* In Java, if and else statements are fundamental control flow constructs used for decision-making. They allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition evaluates to true or false.

The if statement:


The if statement executes a block of code only if its condition is true
SYNTAX






if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}

Working of if Statement

The if-else statement:


The if-else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute if the if condition is false.
SYNTAX






if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}

The else if statement (for multiple conditions):


When there are multiple conditions to check sequentially, else if can be used after an if statement. The first true condition&#x27;s block will be executed, and the rest will be skipped.
SYNTAX






if (condition1) {
    // Code for condition1
} else if (condition2) {
    // Code for condition2 (if condition1 is false)
} else {
    // Code if none of the above conditions are true
}


Key Points:
Condition:


The condition inside the parentheses must be a Boolean expression (evaluates to true or false).
Curly Braces:


The code blocks associated with if, else if, and else are enclosed in curly braces {}.
Optional else:


The else block is optional; an if statement can exist without a corresponding else.
Execution Flow:


Only one block of code within an if-else if-else chain will be executed. The first true 
condition determines which block runs

                              <span>Before flex, before grid, even before float, we still had to lay out web pages.
Not just basic scaffolding, full designs. Carefully crafted interfaces with precise alignment, overlapping layers, and brand-driven visuals. But in the early days of the web, HTML wasn’t built for layout. CSS was either brand-new or barely supported. Positioning was unreliable. Browser behavior was inconsistent.
And yet, somehow, we made it work.
So how did we lay out the web?
With tables. 
Tables.
Not the kind used for tabular data. These were layout tables, deeply nested, stretched and tweaked, often stuffed with invisible spacer GIFs to push elements into place. Text, links, and buttons were dropped into cells and floated among a scaffolding of invisible structure.

                              <span>Introduction to TypeScript and Go


TypeScript and Go now occupy a prominent place in the minds of contemporary engineers. The former grafts optional, static typing onto JavaScript&#x27;s freewheeling syntax, thereby easing the perennial pain of runtime errors. The latter pares programming down to its essentials, affording near-aphasic developers performance and effortless concurrency.
Lately I&#x27;ve been flitting between both languages on separate projects, and the split in their validation cultures jumps out immediately. TypeScript contributors lean on expressive, DSL-like utilities such as Zod that reduce schema verification to a handful of fluent method calls. Go teams, by contrast, often revert to reflection-centred code that is both bulky and, in some edge cases, a noticeable drain on execut…</span>

                              <span>Hi Coders!!
On Day 10 of my frontend journey, I designed a Starbucks landing page clone using pure HTML and CSS.
This project gave me great hands-on practice with CSS positioning, layout structure, and visual design techniques like Flexbox and absolute positioning.
Core Concepts :
1.Navigation Bar (Sticky and Responsive Idea):
Built a top navigation bar with logo, links, search box, and profile icon.
Applied Flexbox (display: flex) for horizontal alignment.
Used position: sticky to make the navbar stick at the top when scrolling.
Added smooth hover effects on links for better user interaction.
2.Positioning Mastery (Absolute &amp; Relative):
The subscription section was challenging:


Background and foreground images (coffee cup) were layered using position: absolute/relative and z-index.

In simple terms, DMARC is like a policy and reporting system that sits on top of existing email authentication methods (SPF and DKIM) to ensure that only legitimate emails get delivered while fraudulent messages (like spoofed phishing emails) are blocked or flagged.
This article will start with a beginner-friendly overview of DMARC and then progressively dive into more technical details, including how it works with SPF/DKIM and why it’s especially important for SaaS companies.
DMARC (which stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance) is essentially a system that tells email receivers how to verify the sour…</span>

FROM ubuntu:latest
USER root
Hardcoded API keys
No version pinning
Last week: seen container compromised because someone deployed with root user + hardcoded API key.
This happens. We write Dockerfiles in a hurry:
FROM ubuntu:latest (no time for versions)
USER root (it just works)
Hardcoded secrets (just for testing)
No pinning (build&#x27;s failing, gotta ship)
we hear warnings but keep driving.
go install github.com/nickciolpan/docker-scan-lite@latest
docker-scan-lite scan Dockerfile

Catches:
Vulnerable base images
Hardcoded secrets

Root user configs
Insecure commands
Unpinned packages
Real output:
🐳 Docker Scan Lite Results
📊 Summary: 3 issues found
🔒 Security Issues
  ⚠️ [HIGH] Container running as root user (line 15)
  ⚠️ [MEDIUM] Using &#x27;latest&#x27; tag not recommended (line 1)
  ⚠️ [LOW] Package installation without version pinning (line 8)

Add to CI:
- name: Scan Dockerfile
  run: docker-scan-lite scan Dockerfile

30 seconds to install. Catches stupid mistakes before production.

Every click, every keyword, every rank shift tells a story. But most businesses only see the surface: where they rank and how many people visited. That’s not insight. That’s just output.
If you want to understand why things are ranking, how your competitors are gaining visibility, or what featured content is being prioritized—you need raw, structured, scalable access to the actual results.
That’s exactly what a SERP API delivers.
But this blog isn’t about definitions. It’s a full breakdown—what it really does, how the smartest companies are using it, and why real-time search data is the backbone of every next-gen SEO, marketing, and AI initiative.

A cloud application platform provides a managed application runtime environment for applications, integrating capabilities to manage the life cycle of an application or application component. This means you can deploy, run, and scale your applications without directly handling the underlying infrastructure.
CAPs provides faster delivery, adaptability, and scalability by offering features like serverless computing and facilitating the deployment and execution, to enable teams to focus on building and scaling applications without being distracted.
Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) are collections of tools, services, automations, and information curated as a product by a dedicated platform team. 
The primary goal of an IDP is to enhance developer productivity and autonomy by reducing reliance on operations teams. 
Let’s examine their similarities and differences to understand when to choose CAPs over IDPs and vice versa.

The above is taken from Mia Platform’s CAP and IDP blog.
Platforms like Mia-Platform integrate CAP and IDP capabilities, offering a solution for modern cloud development and operations.</span>

You&#x27;re trying to talk to a voice assistant or a customer service bot, and it feels like shouting at a very polite, very unhelpful brick wall. You speak, it waits, it processes, and then it blurts out a pre-canned response, completely missing your point. And if you dare to interrupt? Forget about it. The whole conversation just falls apart.
Well, grab a cup of chai, because I want to introduce you to something that might just change how you think about voice AI. It’s called VocRT, and it&#x27;s designed for natural, human-like conversation.
So, What&#x27;s the Big Deal with VocRT?

In today’s fast-paced software development world, where microservices, distributed systems, and cloud-based infrastructures are the norm, resilience is not just a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; feature—it&#x27;s essential. Systems fail, networks falter, and APIs go down. But does your application have to crumble when things go wrong? Absolutely not. This is where Polly, an exceptional .NET resilience framework, steps in to save the day.
In this blog post, we’ll explore how you can build robust, fault-tolerant C# applications using Polly. We’ll cover key resilience patterns like retry policies, circuit breakers, timeouts, and bulkhead isolation, and demonstrate how to implement them with practical, real-world C# examples.
