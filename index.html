                              <span>When working with ASP.NET Core Identity, a set of default tables is automatically created to manage user authentication, roles, claims, and more. These tables are essential for implementing secure and flexible identity management in your application. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of what each table does:
AspNetUsers
UserName
Email
PasswordHash
PhoneNumber
SecurityStamp, etc.
Think of it as the main user profile table.
AspNetRoles
Each role is stored once and assigned a unique ID and name.
AspNetUserRoles
many-to-many relationship between users and roles.
If one user is both an Admin and a Moderator, this table will contain two entries for that user.
AspNetUserLogins
external login provider like:
Google
Facebook
Microsoft
Twitter, etc.
It includes the provider name, key, and associated user ID.
AspNetUserTokens
💾 Contains tokens related to a user such as:
Password reset tokens
Email confirmation tokens
Two-factor authentication tokens
This helps manage temporary access scenarios securely.
AspNetUserClaims
For example:
SubscriptionLevel &#x3D; Premium
Department &#x3D; HR
These claims are typically used for fine-grained authorization.
AspNetRoleClaims
📄 Similar to user claims but tied to roles instead.
Example:
✅ ASP.NET Core Identity Default Tables Summary



Table Name
Purpose




AspNetUsers
Stores user account info like username, email, password hash, etc.


AspNetRoles
Stores role definitions (e.g., Admin, User, Manager).


AspNetUserRoles
Maps users to roles (many-to-many relationship).


AspNetUserLogins
Stores login data from external providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).


AspNetUserTokens
Stores tokens for things like password resets, email confirmations, etc.


AspNetUserClaims
Stores custom claims assigned directly to users.


AspNetRoleClaims
Stores claims assigned to roles (users get these claims via role membership).

The key idea: NLWeb creates a standard protocol that turns any website into a conversational interface that both humans and AI agents can query naturally.
Currently, websites have structured data (Schema.org) but no standard way for AI agents or conversational interfaces to access it. Every implementation is bespoke. Traditional search interfaces struggle with context-aware, multi-turn queries.

We, as creators of digital worlds, have journeyed from towering, singular strongholds to sprawling, interconnected metropolises. Yet, sometimes, the most profound answers lie not in the extremes, but in a thoughtful fusion of wisdom gleaned from all past endeavors. This is the story of the Modular Monolith, an architectural approach that offers a path to structured grace and sustainable growth.

Around 1,000 of us gathered (including 80 speakers) to talk about:
Development (e.g., programming languages, databases, web &amp; mobile development)


User Experience design (e.g., UX/UI design, accessibility)
Development practices (e.g., Agile and Lean methodologies, DevOps practices)
Artificial Intelligence and data science (e.g., machine learning, LLMs, data science)
Infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing, IoT)
Information security and privacy (e.g., cybersecurity, data protection)
And much more (e.g., power skills, blockchain, etc.).
 
As expected... I loved the SWAG this year, the design was A MAP created with GitHub Commit contributions! (Amazing work 😍):

let age &#x3D; 20;
let idProof &#x3D; true;

// Logical AND checks both conditions
if (age &gt;&#x3D; 18 &amp;&amp; idProof) {
  console.log(&quot;Allowed&quot;); 
} else {
  console.log(&quot;Not Allowed&quot;);  
}

Output:
Allowed
The logical OR (||) operator checks whether at least one of the operands is true. If either operand is true, the result is true. If both operands are false, the result is false.
// Check if at least one condition is true
let age &#x3D; 16;
let hasGuardian &#x3D; true;

// Logical OR checks if either condition is true
if (age &gt;&#x3D; 18 || hasGuardian) {
  console.log(&quot;Allowed&quot;);
} else {
  console.log(&quot;Not Allowed&quot;);
}

Output:
Allowed
TheparseInt method parses a value as a string and returns the first integer. It accepts a string argument and optional radix parameter, defining the numeral system base. This method is commonly used for converting string representations of numbers into integers.
Example:
The method takes two parameters: the string to be parsed and the radix (optional, default is 10).
2 &#x3D; binary, 8 &#x3D; octal, 10 &#x3D; decimal, 16 &#x3D; hexadecimal.

Syntax:
parseInt(Value, radix);
Parameters:
Value: This parameter contains a string that is converted to an integer.
    radix: This parameter represents the radix or base to be used and it is optional.

JavaScript provides several ways to execute a block of code repeatedly. These are called looping statements.
Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Syntax: while (condition) { // code to execute }
Example:




     let i &#x3D; 0;
     while (i &lt; 5) {
       console.log(i); // Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
       i++;

                              <span>A submission for the Postmark Challenge: Inbox Innovators
Hey folks! 👋
I built an Email-based AI Assistant powered by FastAPI, Gemini, and Postmark. The assistant allows users to send an email and get an AI-generated response right in their inbox — just like magic 🪄.
Here’s the workflow in simple terms:
User sends an email ➝ Postmark receives it ➝ Webhook (FastAPI backend) is triggered ➝
Gemini processes the email ➝ Response is generated ➝
Reply is sent back to the user via Postmark


📧 Try it yourself:
assistant@codewithpravesh.tech
“Explain Postmark in brief” and within 30–60 seconds, you’ll get an intelligent reply — straight to your inbox.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;m not sure how this works but it said I could make a first post so here goes:
How are you all doing? 
I joined this community (which looks awesome btw) in the hopes of learning more in regards to coding. I have some basic knowledge of coding languages like Python and HTML and have taken part in a hackathon once upon a time. 
Although I havent made any projects recently and I think thats something I need to work on so I&#x27;m going to try my best to do more of that. 
If you have a project that you&#x27;re working on and dont mind someone with little to no experience in coding, do let me know. As what I lack in experience I make up for in enthusiasm, words of encouragement and memes. Hopefully if you do let me join your team we get some sort of work done. In all seriousness I plan on getting better at coding so I&#x27;ll have more to offer. Also if you require a video editor, I am very confident in my video editing capabilities and have made a video for a Star Wars hackathon which I took part in last year (I&#x27;ll put the video in my next post).
Currently I&#x27;m self-studying Harvards CS50 intro to computer science and its very interesting. I hope to learn more and grow with you all. Thanks for making this community.
P.S I&#x27;m a huge Naruto fan (hence my cover image/gif), its a topic I&#x27;m extremely knowledgeable about but unfortunately cant add to my CV. Maybe I&#x27;ll make a Naruto inspired website one day😅</span>

Today I bounced between code, concepts, and creative work, and somehow managed to enjoy every bit of it.
🧠 LRU Cache in C++ – Understood &amp; Implemented
I started the day by learning the implementation of the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache in C++. 
🎒 0/1 Knapsack – DP | Completed
Next up was the good ol’ 0/1 Knapsack Problem in Dynamic Programming. Finally wrapped up the implementation and variations. 
💼 Portfolio Updates
Later, I worked on improving my portfolio.

                              <span>No servers. No maintenance headaches. Just pure web magic.
Here&#x27;s how I created &quot;https://www.cloudprojects.site/&quot; using AWS services that scale automatically and never go down.
The results will shock you. 👇
❌ The Old Way (Traditional Hosting):
✅ The New Way (AWS Static Website):
Why didn&#x27;t I discover this sooner?

Step 1: Domain Registration 🌐
Bought my domain from Hostinger **for **89/- INR.
Simple interface. 
Competitive pricing.

Step 2: S3 Bucket Creation 📦
Created an S3 bucket named &quot;cloudprojects.site&quot;.
Enabled static website hosting.
Uploaded all HTML, CSS, JavaScript files.

Pro tip: Make sure your main file is named &quot;index.html&quot;
Step 3: CloudFront Distribution ⚡
Set up CloudFront CDN for lightning-fast global delivery.
This serves my website from 400+ edge locations worldwide.
