The Node.js team just released Node.js 24 with significant updates and new features. Over the years, Node.js has become known for its dependence on third-party libraries for executing most of its tasks, from TypeScript support to testing to environment variable handling. 
Node.js 24 ships with native features that improve developer experience, security, and reduce dependency overhead. You can check out our general overview of the Node.js 24 release here. But the subtlety of some of these new features is something I’m concerned many developers will miss. 
In this tutorial, we’ll explore 10 Node.js features you might not be using yet — but absolutely should be. The good news is that from October 2025 onward, Node.js 24 becomes a Long-Term Support (LTS) release_._ A…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re chasing cinematic perfection without hauling around a full-sized rig, you’ve probably heard whispers about the RED KOMODO-X. Spoiler alert: it lives up to the hype.
Whether you&#x27;re crafting indie films, high-impact branded content, or elevating your YouTube visuals, this compact powerhouse is making waves for all the right reasons. Let&#x27;s dig into why creators—from drone operators to docu-style shooters—are falling hard for this camera.
First things first: don’t judge the RED KOMODO-X by its size. Sure, it looks like a compact camera, but under the hood, it&#x27;s got serious muscle. This beast captures pristine 6K footage with a Super 35 global shutter sensor—a huge leap forward for filmmakers tired of the jello effect caused by rolling shutters.
That global shutter makes a difference.…</span>

So, hopefully you have a bunch of MiniScript-related GitHub repositories, or you will soon.  Here are some important tips on how to configure those repos properly, to be a good citizen and benefit the MiniScript community.
miniscript and minimicro


The most important thing you should do for any MiniScript-related project is to tag it (in the &quot;About&quot; info) with miniscript.  This will cause your project to appear under the miniscript topics list:

If your project is written for Mini Micro, you should also tag it with minimicro, thus adding it to …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re using Tailwind CSS with Next.js or other modern frameworks, you&#x27;ve likely come across directives like @layer base, @layer components, and @layer utilities. But what&#x27;s the difference between them, and how should they be used?

This article explains each of them with practical examples to help you better structure your styles using Tailwind.
@layer base



For global resets and initial styles
This is the first layer loaded. Ideal for:
Resetting styles
Setting global fonts
Basic element styles like body, h1, button, etc.




@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900;
  }

  body {
     @apply bg-background text-foreground font-sans;
  }
}

@layer components



For reusable components (buttons, cards, badges, etc.)
Loaded after base and before utilities. Perfect for blocks of combined utility classes:
@layer components {
  .btn {
    @apply px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-md;
  }

  .card {
    @apply shadow-md rounded-lg p-4 bg-white;
  }
}

@layer utilities



For custom utilities
The last layer to load. Best used for specific, override-style utilities:
@layer utilities {
  .text-shadow {
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  }

  .scrollbar-none {
    scrollbar-width: none;
    -ms-overflow-style: none;
  }
}

@layer base        &lt;- Global styles
@layer components  &lt;- Reusable components
@layer utilities   &lt;- Specific utilities (highest priority)

Use each like this:
base: for tag resets and global defaults
components: for .btn, .card, .input, etc.
utilities: for .text-shadow, .scroll-smooth, etc.
@layer components {
  .promo-price {
    @apply text-purple-600 font-bold;
  }

  .add-button {
    @apply px-4 py-1 bg-gray-200 rounded text-sm font-medium;
  }
}

                              <span>Angular&#x27;s default style encapsulation prevents styles from leaking into or out of components. But sometimes, you want your component to adapt based on context provided by external elements, such as a dark class on the  element. This is where :host-context() comes in.
:host-context()?


The :host-context() pseudo-class in Angular allows a component’s style to react to ancestor elements outside the component’s view encapsulation boundary.
It checks if the component is rendered inside an element matching the selector.
:host-context(body.dark) {
  .container {
    background-color: #222;
    color: white;
  }
}

This means: &quot;Apply this style if the component is somewhere inside a .&quot;
Theming (e.g. light/dark mode)
Reacting to global classes or layout wrappers
Making components context-aware
✅ :host-context() checks up the DOM tree, not down.
✅ It works with Angular&#x27;s default ViewEncapsulation.Emulated.
❌ It does not work with ShadowDom encapsulation.
❌ Do not repeat the context selector inside the rule block.
:host {
  .container {
    background: white;
    color: black;
  }
}

:host-context(body.dark) {
  .container {
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

// ❌ Incorrect
:host-context(body.dark) {
  .dark {
    background: black;
  }
}

This is wrong because .dark is already in the selector. You don&#x27;t need to repeat it.
Use :host-context() to style Angular components based on their ancestors, such as when a global dark class is added to the  tag. It’s a powerful tool to make your components responsive to global layout or theming changes.</span>

We at Ducky.ai noticed a strange thing has happened in software development, we’re no longer writing code in the traditional sense. Instead, we describe what we want and ask the machine to write the first draft. Tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit, and Devin have changed what it means to build. The keyboard isn’t gone, but it’s quieter. Developers are prompting, guiding, reviewing. Code appears in response to our intent.
This isn’t a distant future. It’s happening now. Describe a function in a comment and Copilot autocompletes it. Open a new file in Cursor and ask for a feature, and it drafts the architecture across files. The role of a developer is less that of a typist, but more akin to a curator or conductor.
But even the best AI tools come with hallucinat…</span>

The Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (PGPA) Act 2013 is a key piece of Australian government regulation shaping how Commonwealth entities manage governance, performance and accountability. For software developers and product managers working within or with federal agencies, understanding the PGPA Act and its impact on cyber risk management and compliance is increasingly essential. This article breaks down the main concepts of the PGPA Act and PGPA Rule, their connection to Australian cybersecurity frameworks and practical implications for digital security in the public sector.

What if you could prove you&#x27;re over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. 
The need for better age verification today
We&#x27;re witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors&#x27; access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. 
For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites…</span>

XRP derivatives markets turn bearish amid reducing institutional demand, suggesting further downside for XRP price.

XRP’s descending triangle breakout could lead to a decline toward $1.96.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 45% since April 7 lows to trade at $2.31 on May 27. But the price remains 31% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns about XRP’s ability to rise higher.
Will XRP’s price drop from the current levels in the coming days?
XRP derivatives data lean bearish

A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. 
Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.
A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went …</span>

                              <span>MARA Holdings, formerly Marathon Digital Holdings, reached a new all-time high in Bitcoin mining revenue, fueled by its recent surge to a record price.
The company’s annualized mining revenue exceeded $752 million on May 27, according to data from CryptoQuant, making it the most profitable day in the company’s history. Marathon is currently the world’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin (BTC) mining firm by market capitalization.  
“Quarterly reports are slow. Onchain shows revenue in real time,” CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju wrote in a May 27 X post, confirming the milestone. 
Marathon’s record revenue surge occurred days after Bitcoin rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, a development attributed by some analysts to Japanese bond market turbulence, which saw bond yiel…</span>

The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. 
“S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications.

Based on a survey of 7,200 adults across the US, Europe, Singapore and Australia, the report found that Europe has been leading the way in growing crypto ownership, with the UK in front.

Bitcoin’s RSI has dropped 15% and is now below the overbought threshold.

Bitcoin futures flip bearish with a 43% decline in perpetual CVD.

Analysts predict Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as long as a key support level holds.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price hit fresh all-time highs of nearly $112,000 on May 23, gaining 50% from its April 1 lows. According to analysts, BTC price is now “showing signs of easing momentum” as it consolidates. 
Bitcoin’s rally to $111K triggered buyer fatigue
BTC’s recent run to $111,000 pushed the daily relative strength index (RSI) into the overbought zone at 79.6. However, “signs of easing momentum” have emerged as the RSI dropped by 15% to 67, said market intelligence firm Glassnode in its latest report, adding:

The NRA identified VASPs as an emerging risk in its 2020 report after “a detailed assessment of ML inherent risks emerging from virtual assets.” This was followed by a 2022 NRA report deeming “the risks associated with crypto assets and virtual currencies as very high,” because, among other things, they are internet-based and cross-border.

The company announced that BGUSD offers an annual yield of 4%, which is credited daily to users’ spot accounts. Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.
The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.

The UK-based exchange plans to open a physical office during the second quarter in Nigeria — its “fastest-growing market” in West Africa — along with broader expansion efforts in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, according to a May 27 report by Bloomberg.
“Nigeria has taken meaningful steps toward creating a clear framework for crypto,” Owenize Odia, Blockchain.com’s general manager for Africa, reportedly said.
The move comes as global sentiment shifts, including political tailwinds from the United States, where President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has encouraged industry expansion.

Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.
The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. 
Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.
From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.
Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.

“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.

                              <span>The Instagram account of former US rap trio Migos was hacked in an apparent attempt to blackmail Solana co-founder Raj Gokal.
On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph that have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.
Another image posted by the account hacker shows what the caption claimed was Gokal’s wife holding up a driver’s license, while a …</span>

                              <span>Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, says institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that could pose security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

Business Insider reported on May 26 that at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said that “there are four essential characteristics of intelligent behavior that every animal, or relatively smart animal, can do, and certainly humans.” 
“Understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, being able to reason and being able to plan complex actions, particularly planning hierarchically,” LeCun said.
He said current large language models (LLMs) that power popular AI chatbots have not hit this threshold, and “incorporating these capabilities would require a sh…</span>

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”
