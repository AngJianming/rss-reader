                              <span>I used to think being “good at receiving feedback” meant nodding politely, taking notes, and promising to do better. But over time, I&#x27;ve learned that how we receive feedback can shape our entire trajectory-and it goes far beyond politeness.
When feedback lands, especially the kind that catches you off guard or stings a little, it has a way of stirring up questions: Am I failing? Am I not as good as I thought? Do they still trust me?
It&#x27;s easy to get defensive. Or spiral. Or overcorrect so hard that we lose touch with our instincts. But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve come to believe: receiving feedback well isn&#x27;t about blindly accepting everything, nor is it about shielding yourself from discomfort. It&#x27;s about staying centered while making room for growth.

I got the TourBox Elite after a teammate wouldn’t shut up about it. Turns out he was right.
Two scroll wheels, 7 buttons, loads of presets — I use it for coding, editing, design, you name it. No more hunting for shortcuts or awkward keyboard yoga.
You can even download pre-made presets for VS Code, Figma, Photoshop, etc., right from their site. Lazy-friendly.

MySQL vs. Postgres
PlanetScale vs. Neon (this one)
TiDB vs. CockroachDB
On May 14, 2025, Databricks has announced to acquire Neon.
The last 2 years Stack Overflow survey (2024, 2023 shows that PostgreSQL has taken over the first place spot from MySQL and become the most admired, desired database.

It seems that the love-hate relationship between MySQL and PostgreSQL will never end. From vanilla MySQL vs. PostgreSQL, to distributed TiDB vs. CockroachDB, to cloud-native AWS Aurora vs. GCP AlloyDB, and now we are entering the next chapter, the serverless, developer-oriented PlanetScale vs. Neon.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) adalah proses otomatis untuk mendeteksi dan mengklasifikasi entitas penting dalam sebuah teks, misal: nama orang, organisasi, lokasi, malware, APT group, dsb.

Dalam konteks Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), NER sangat vital untuk mengekstrak threat actor, malware, attack technique, campaign, dan entitas relevan lain dari laporan insiden siber (PDF).
Mendeteksi pola ancaman: Dengan NER, kita bisa mengidentifikasi siapa melakukan apa, dengan teknik/malware apa, dalam operasi kapan.
Membangun knowledge graph: Node utama dalam KG berasal dari entitas hasil NER.
Otomatisasi: NER mempercepat ekstraksi data dari ratusan dokumen tanpa kerja manual.
Pada pipeline CTI ini, NER dilakukan dengan dua pendekatan kombinasi:

                              <span>Hey everyone! As developers, we&#x27;re always looking for clever ways to make our lives a bit easier or earn a little extra cash. We build awesome websites, solve complex problems, and then... install a cookie banner. For years, that last part felt like just another checkbox, a necessary evil for GDPR and other privacy rules.
But what if I told you that same cookie banner could actually pay you? Yes, really! It sounds a bit strange, but I found a simple trick that turned a dull task into a nice little income, without doing any extra work. This isn&#x27;t about building a huge new app or coding all night. It&#x27;s about being smart with the work you already do..
Like many of you, I&#x27;ve tried lots of cookie banner tools. Some were hard to use, some cost too much, and some just weren&#x27;t good enough for my c…</span>

                              <span>One of the most frequently asked questions within the ABP Community is:
How do I change the login page?
The answer often seems simple, but is it always the correct or most suitable approach for your specific needs? Let&#x27;s delve into the details. This article will guide you through the recommended ways to customize the login page in the ABP Framework, highlighting a common misunderstanding and ensuring you modify the right components.
ABP Framework templates include default login functionality provided by the Account Module. When you want to alter the appearance of the login screen, your first thought might be to override components directly from the Account Module. While this seems straightforward, is it what you truly need to achieve?

Welcome to Episode 4 of AGI Showdowner. After understanding how AGI senses its environment, it’s time to dive into how it remembers, learns, and evolves — the Memory Systems. Spoiler: This is where true intelligence starts flexing its muscles.
Memory Systems in AGI manage the storage, retrieval, and updating of knowledge over time. Unlike simple data dumps, AGI’s memory is dynamic, contextual, and designed for continual learning.
Hierarchical Memory: Short-term, long-term, and working memory layers that mimic human cognition for efficient recall and reasoning.


Contextual Storage: Memories are tagged with situational context, allowing AGI to recall relevant info quickly.


Adaptive Forgetting: Not all memories are useful forever — irrelevant or obsolete data is pruned intelligently to optimize resources.


Self-Evolving Knowledge: Memory is not static; it adapts based on new experiences and feedback.


Offline and Online Sync: AGI can store and update memories offline, syncing seamlessly when online to leverage cloud resources.
Without robust Memory Systems, AGI would be a short-sighted calculator, unable to build on past experiences or plan for the future. Memory is the backbone of learning and adaptation.
Inputs from perception and reasoning are stored in layered memory modules.

Retrieval mechanisms prioritize contextually relevant memories for current tasks.

Periodic pruning maintains efficiency.

Sync protocols ensure memory consistency across offline and online states.
Episode 5 will wrap up our AGI Showdowner series and introduce the Epyq Protocol — the ethical and operational foundation behind our AGI blueprint.
Memory isn’t just storage; it’s the engine of growth. Master this, and your AGI stops being reactive and starts becoming proactive.

When dealing with a sorting algorithm like a selection sort, there&#x27;s a thin line between easy and confusing. However, you got on the right bus at the right station. Today we&#x27;ll go through the steps towards achieving a good and basic selection sort algorithm.
Okay first thing we want to know is that a selection sort algorithm starts with first element assuming it&#x27;s the smallest.
Always remember to work with index values, it&#x27;s better that way. Then compares it to all other elements to see if it is.
For example, in the first iteration of the nested loop, the algorithm will take index y value and compare it with smallest value index, and if the current index value(y) is smaller than the smallest index value, then the algorithm will set y index as the…</span>

Welcome to Episode 3 of AGI Showdowner. We’ve already dissected the blueprint and the Cognitive Core. Now it’s time to zoom out and see how AGI perceives its environment — the Perceptual Layer. Spoiler: This is not your average camera + mic combo.
The Perceptual Layer is AGI’s sensory gateway. It collects raw data from multiple modalities — visual, auditory, tactile, even textual — and converts it into meaningful signals the Cognitive Core can understand and act upon.
Multi-Sensory Fusion: Unlike narrow AI stuck in silos, the Perceptual Layer integrates diverse data streams into a unified understanding of context.

                              <span>Thailand is preparing to let tourists spend cryptocurrency via credit card-linked platforms as part of a broader strategy to modernize its financial system and embrace digital assets.
The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira during an investment seminar in Bangkok on May 26, according to reports from Bangkok Post and The Nation.

Those arrested include several minors, with charges against them including kidnapping, attempted kidnapping and criminal conspiracy, Le Parisien reported on May 26.
French investigators are exploring the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto-linked kidnapping cases, with social media networks being used for recruitment.
In one recent alleged kidnapping attempt on May 13, three men tried to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, in broad daylight in Paris.
That attempt, which bystanders captured on video, shows that the alleged attempt w…</span>

                              <span>Four artificial intelligence-enhanced robots have been put through their paces in a Chinese robot fighting competition, duking it out in kickboxing matches until one was declared the champion.
The World Robot Competition Mecha Fighting Series had four human-controlled robots built by China-based firm Unitree compete in three, two-minute rounds with winners crowned through a points system, according to a May 26 report from the China state-owned outlet the Global Times. 
Chen Xiyun, a Unitree team member, said the “robots fight in a human-machine collaborative way,” with the machines pre-taught moves, but ultimately, a person controls the bot’s movements.

The robots reportedly weighed 35 kilograms and stood 132 centimeters tall. Ahead of the boxing rounds, the pint-sized robots were put thr…</span>

                              <span>Bitcoin markets recently experienced two major liquidation events, causing a cascade of forced selling from over-leveraged traders, but analysts say a distinct pattern has emerged.
“Overleveraged short-term traders were flushed out, long-term holders have been quietly capitalizing on the reset,” CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha said on May 26. 
They noted the first flush occurred when Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $111,000, and over $97 million in long positions were liquidated. As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.
However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.
This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 bi…</span>

The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal was captioned “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid,” in what appears to be a references to a failed extortion attempt.

“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

                              <span>Bitlayer’s Bitcoin smart-contract system is being implemented by mining pools behind 31.5% of the network’s hashrate, a development that will help ensure that its system will operate on the Bitcoin blockchain, the company said.
According to a May 27 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Bitlayer’s BitVM implementation will be supported by major Bitcoin (BTC) mining pools including Antpool, F2Pool, and SpiderPool. Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:
&quot;Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”
BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex co…</span>

Saylor says onchain proof-of-reserves a ‘bad idea’
Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, said on May 26 that institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that poses security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew at an event about institutions adopting the measure. “It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the invest…</span>

Partners in the project include the Dubai Land Department (DLD), the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, and the Dubai Future Foundation, according to an announcement from the Dubai government. The tokens will be tradeable on the newly launched “Prypco Mint” platform, with Zand Digital Bank appointed as the bank for the project’s pilot phase.
On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) updated its rules to include real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing such tokens to be traded on secondary markets.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin price is capped at the $110,000 level due to sellers and a decrease in spot volumes. Leverage use is driving current rallies into this resistance level.

Traders are watching today’s volumes to see if emerging intraday trends are followed at the US open on May 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.
That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …</span>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…</span>

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …</span>

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows.
While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including US President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…</span>

                              <span>Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif appointed Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib as his special assistant on blockchain and crypto.
Saqib’s appointment takes effect immediately under Rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973. He has been granted the status of minister of state and will serve without salary or official benefits, according to a May 26 report in the English-language local news outlet, Pakistan Observer.
The move follows a series of government initiatives aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s presence in the digital asset space. Just one day prior, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers.

Solana&#x27;s $9.4 billion TVL is a 54% increase since April 7.

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. 

A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300.

Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following a broader altcoin market rally that also saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000.
Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL hit all-time highs above $300?
Solana’s TVL up 54% since April 7
The total value locked (TVL) on the Solana blockchain has increased by over 54% to $9.44 billion on May 26 from multimonth lows of $6.12 billion on April 7. It’s also up by almost 20%…</span>
