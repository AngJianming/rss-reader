                              <span>Introduction


When building your web applications, you might need to format numbers as monetary values. For example, rather than displaying the value 123.45, you might want to display it as £123.45.
In this Quickfire article, we&#x27;re going to look at two different approaches to formatting monetary values in JavaScript.
The first approach you can use to format monetary values in JavaScript is the toLocaleString() method. This method formats a number according to the locale and options you specify.
Let&#x27;s take a look at an example:
const value &#x3D; 123.45;

const formattedValue &#x3D; value.toLocaleString(&#x27;en-GB&#x27;, {
  style: &#x27;currency&#x27;,
  currency: &#x27;GBP&#x27;,
});

// formattedValue will be &#x27;£123.45&#x27;

In the example above, we&#x27;ve used the toLocaleString() method to format the value as a monetary value in Br…</span>

                              <span>If you grew up playing Windows games in the &#x27;90s, you probably remember SkiFree, the addictive skiing game where you dodged obstacles and tried to escape the infamous Yeti. I decided to recreate this classic using Amazon Q, Amazon&#x27;s AI assistant, and was amazed by how quickly I could build a functional clone.
In this blog post, I&#x27;ll walk through my process, the prompts I used, and how I refined the game with additional features like boosts and power-ups.
I started by giving Amazon Q a clear prompt outlining the game&#x27;s mechanics and technical requirements:

Amazon Q generated a Python script using Pygame, which handled the core mechanics beautifully. The initial version included:
A skier controlled with arrow keys


Random obstacle generation (trees and rocks)


Collision detection

The framework offers three key advantages:
Complete Privacy: All processing happens on-device
Offline Capability: Works without internet once loaded


Zero App Bloat: Model is embedded in the OS, not your app
Instead of constantly rebuilding apps to test prompts, use Xcode&#x27;s updated Playground feature. Import Playgrounds in any project file, use #Playground to test FoundationModels code directly, and get live feedback as you refine prompts.
Use the @Generable annotation to get structured data instead of parsing text. Create data structures like Itinerary with nested types, and the model automatically generates matching Swift objects.

                              <span>Hi everyone! 👋

I&#x27;m Juan, and for the last few months I&#x27;ve been working on a project to improve my trading win rate by leveraging Social Arbitrage and AI.

I used to lose money trading—even when holding solid assets—but thanks to this project, I went from losing to winning really quickly.
This is my PnL from just the last 30 days:


This project is still in its early stages and not officially released yet, which is why I&#x27;m offering the chance to join as a beta tester and get free early access in exchange for your feedback on the current version.
I’m also opening a waiting list for those who are interested but would prefer to wait for the full launch.
If you decide to participate, you’ll get access to all the app’s current features:
Global event notifications – Stay updated on all events worldwide that directly or indirectly affect the assets you’re tracking


Thesis mode – Automatically validate your market hypotheses like “Bitcoin is going up” or “Tesla will drop”


Sentiment trends – Track the current sentiment of most assets and companies around the globe


Social Agent – A custom AI agent with access to our event graph database. It understands complex investment strategies and real-world scenarios. Ask things like:


“Should I invest in Apple now?”

“When should I enter this trade?”
If you’d rather wait, you can still register and you’ll receive an automatic notification when the app is fully launched.
For more updates about the project, visit my X account or the project&#x27;s official account, where we also share predictions generated with Social.
Finally, a question for you, reader:

Would you be interested in weekly posts here sharing progress on the project and sneak peeks at upcoming features?
I know this post may feel a little like an advertisement—and that’s because it is.

This is a bootstrapped project (which means I’m funding it myself), and I’m putting my heart and soul into it.

If you can give it a try or help spread the word, that would mean the world to me.</span>

Creating apps that work seamlessly across different screen sizes and platforms is more important than ever. The UIKit team shared essential best practices for building flexible UIKit applications that deliver amazing experiences regardless of device or window size.
Scenes are the cornerstone of flexible apps. A scene represents an instance of your app&#x27;s UI, containing view controllers and views while providing crucial functionality:
Independent state management - Each scene saves and restores its UI state independently
External data handling - Built-in support for deep linking and URL handling


Context awareness - Provides screen and window geometry information
Multiple scene support - Different scene types for distinct experiences (…</span>

                              <span>In today’s rapidly evolving wellness industry, enhancing client comfort and care is paramount. Spas and Medspas are integrating technology to provide seamless experiences and prompt services. One such innovation is the integration of a client assistance button—a simple yet powerful addition that enables clients lying on treatment beds to request help without moving or speaking. This becomes especially important in a luxury wellness setting like a Medspa.
In this post, we’ll explore how to create a client assistance button system, connected to a Python server. We’ll cover the hardware and software components, and how it can improve customer service in your Medspa.

The most visually striking change in iOS 26 is the introduction of Liquid Glass, a translucent, dynamic material that brings life to your app&#x27;s interface with specular highlights and refraction effects. This new material has been applied across UIKit&#x27;s standard components including navigation bars, search fields, alerts, popovers, and split views.

We will create three Organization Units (OUs) Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.

This article explains core AI use cases in QA automation with concrete step-by-step examples so you can see exactly how these innovations work in practice.
1. AI-Powered Test Case Generation
AI Solution: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate test cases automatically from user stories or requirements.
Step-by-Step Example:
Step 1: Input user story text into an NLP-based test generation tool.
E*xample user story:*
As a user, I want to log in with a valid email and password so that I can access my account.
**Step 2: **The AI parses this text to identify key actions, inputs, and expected outcomes.

Since 2013, I’ve been writing bash scripts professionally. Early on, my scripts were fragile—functional on my local setup but prone to mysterious failures in production. Debugging felt like navigating a maze blindfolded.
After numerous late-night fire drills, botched deployments, and an infamous incident where I inadvertently wiped out a quarter of our testing environment, I honed techniques to create reliable bash scripts.
