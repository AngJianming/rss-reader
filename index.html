In this guide, we&#x27;re going to dive into how to integrate Supabase, with Angular to build a secure authentication application. We’ll set up signup, and login authentication with Supabase in Angular and protect routes of some pages. Let’s get started
Before we dive in, make sure you&#x27;ve got:
An Angular project
Node.js v16+ installed
A Supabase account at Supabase Website




  
  
  Step 1: Set Up a Supabase Project


Create a New Project:
Log in to Supabase and click New Project.

Enter a project name, and database password, and choose a region.

Wait a few minutes for the project to provision.
Retrieve API Credentials:
Project URL and anon public (API Key).

Generate a New Angular App:

App.js
import &#x27;./App.css&#x27;;

function App() {
  return (
    
Select Image:

                              <span>AI is incredible at writing code fast. It&#x27;s terrible at writing secure code.
After months of reviewing AI-generated code, I&#x27;ve noticed the same security holes appear over and over. Here are the patterns that keep showing up, and how to catch them before they become problems.
What AI does:
// AI loves writing this
app.post(&#x27;/users&#x27;, (req, res) &#x3D;&gt; {
const { name, email, age } &#x3D; req.body;
const user &#x3D; new User({ name, email, age });
user.save();
});

The problem: No validation whatsoever. AI treats user input like trusted data.
What you&#x27;ll actually get:
Empty strings breaking your database
Malicious scripts in name fields
Negative ages and impossible dates
Emails like &quot;definitely-not-an-email&quot;
How to spot it: Look for any endpoint that takes req.body data and uses it directly without checking…</span>

                              <span>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a cutting-edge language model that has made a significant impact in the field of natural language processing. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, making it an excellent tool for chatbots, content creation, and other applications that require natural language processing. In this post, we will explore the workings of ChatGPT to understand how it generates human-like text.
The backbone of ChatGPT is a transformer-based neural network that has been trained on a massive amount of text data. This training allows the model to understand the patterns and relationships between words in a sentence and how they can be used to generate new text that is coherent and meaningful. The transformer-based architecture i…</span>

                              <span>As a node js developer it&#x27;s really - really hard for me to admit that node is not built for complex multithreading applications. Somethings which would be as easy as hello world in some other language or runtime - it would be near impossible to implement in node js espically due to it&#x27;s single threaded nature. Go on the other hand comes with built in support for multithreading.
I had been tackling an issue where I needed to synchronize my database with a CRM database which had strict limit on how many API requests I could make per 5 secs. I tried everything from shifting framework (Node to Nest), tried using event driven architecture with REDIS as transport, and tried using BullMQ. But nothing worked; I needed my application to run 24/7 and keep data in sync - node just couldn&#x27;t do it. It lacks alot in this domain due to it&#x27;s internal acrhecture. 

Go on other hand had shined here - it came with built in support for background jobs running on multiple threads. I could make 100s to 1000s of background jobs using go routines on same machine where I could barely run 3 or 4 in node js. Go allowed me to run the application 24/7 without any downtime - yes I mean any. Not once was heap memory full or some other internal issue. 
But even go had it&#x27;s downside. Not a lot of community support espically in niched areas. I had to build a lot of stuff which is easy to implement in node js by installing third party libraries. 
if anyone has worked or is working on API polling database&#x27;s, or similar task - I would love to connect with you</span>

Learning a programming language is most effective when paired with hands-on projects, as real-world challenges accelerate mastery. With a background in C# and active contributions to the Brighter framework, I decided to build a project called Ming to deepen my Elixir skills. This project explores Elixir’s functional programming paradigm while implementing patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation).
Ming draws inspiration from the Brighter framework and Commanded. Its core focus is to replicate and adapt CQRS principles from C# to Elixir’s.
Maybe you are asking yourself why Ming and if there is any meaning, I was looking a library name that was short easy to pronounce in English and it should be close the Brighter, I couldn&#x27;t find any good name in Portugues…</span>
