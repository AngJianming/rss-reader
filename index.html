But how is this happening? Are all these people really transferring from talking to humans to talking to machines? What does the language model operate behind these AIs? In 2025, there is no ambiguity between talking and chat bots. It&#x27;s framed mostly by instruction and subsequently, output.
Of course, the ability for AI to talk like a human wasn&#x27;t developed overnight either. Over the years, developments in large language processing models have created systems that operate on trillions of parameters - whereas previous iterations operated on mere billions. This difference of magnitude means that AI can better understand context, remember previous messages and conversations, and stay on task within one stream of consciousness across lengthier periods.

                              <span>The Chat Experience: From Digital Conversations in 2021 to Human Interactions in 2025


The chat experience has changed exponentially. Who would have thought that such advancements would be made in the world of chat? Those annoying automated systems from 2021, barely able to comprehend an easy yes or no question, are worlds apart from what 2025 holds. Yet, we know what 2025 holds - and these new AI companions don&#x27;t just get what we&#x27;re saying - they empathize and connect on increasingly human levels.
It&#x27;s not just a technical advancement. The chat experience involves protections and boundaries that change the ways in which humans and machines communicate and interact at previously human-only levels.

                              <span>Structured Query Language (SQL) is an essential tool for working with databases, but even seasoned developers sometimes make mistakes that can lead to slow queries, inaccurate data, and inefficient systems.
When summarizing data, the GROUP BY clause organizes information into meaningful groups. However, misusing GROUP BY can lead to incorrect results—sometimes without obvious errors.
A database tracks employee salaries per department. Someone writes:
sql
To summarize salaries by department, the query should be:
sql
sql
Only group necessary columns—non-grouped columns need aggregate functions. 
Use HAVING instead of WHERE for filtering grouped results:
sql
During testing, SELECT * is quick and handy. But in production? It slows queries, overloads networks, and makes applications harder to maintain.
sql
sql
Explicitly specify needed columns instead of SELECT *.
Use LIMIT for large queries:
sql
sql
sql
Indexes speed up data retrieval, but poorly designed indexes can slow down updates, inserts, and deletes.
sql
A better strategy:
sql
Index columns frequently used in WHERE clauses. 
Avoid over-indexing, which slows write operations.
Use EXPLAIN or ANALYZE to check query performance:
sql
Use composite indexes only when queries filter by multiple columns:
sql
NULL values represent missing information, and if not handled correctly, they can cause errors or misleading results.
This query calculates average salaries:
sql
Ensure NULLs are accounted for:
sql
sql
Use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL to prevent logic errors. 
Replace NULLs using COALESCE() or IFNULL():
sql
Validate NULL handling in reports to avoid misleading calculations.
SQL mistakes can affect speed, accuracy, and system stability. But with the right practices, you can write efficient, optimized queries that scale well.
GROUP BY must include all non-aggregated columns to avoid incorrect grouping. 
Never use SELECT * in production—fetch only required data. 
Index smartly, targeting commonly searched fields. 
Handle NULLs carefully, ensuring accurate calculations.</span>

                              <span>In accounting firms, internal policies and procedures outline the rules and standards that guide employee behavior, ensure compliance, and maintain operational efficiency. These policies are documented in materials such as employee handbooks, code of conduct agreements, confidentiality agreements, and compliance checklists, which require multiple signatures for acknowledgment and legal compliance. Obtaining these signatures manually can be slow and lead to problems like lost or misfiled documents. BoldSign simplifies this process by allowing firms to send, sign, and store these documents electronically, reducing delays and ensuring secure, streamlined compliance.
In this blog post, we will see how BoldSign enhances the communication of internal policies and procedures.

Does chatting with a chatbot feel like reading an FAQ on the web anymore? It certainly doesn&#x27;t. By 2025, AI conversations have become even more humanized, transforming what was once a fictionalized trajectory into a real live experience.
Conversational AI development has accelerated exponentially beyond expected growth. AI&#x27;s don&#x27;t just answer questions anymore - they appreciate sarcasm, recall prior conversations, operate with an emotional intelligence sensitivity to sympathizing with human responses, and even steer conversations in such a way that they&#x27;ll ensure the best possible user experience. This isn&#x27;t merely the projection of technological advancement; this is a psychological, permanent shift in what humans come to expect from their relationship…</span>

“You can’t stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.”
Whether we like it or not, AI is the most powerful tool we have today for building software — from generating boilerplate CRUD code, to setting up secure authentication systems, to designing architectural solutions for complex business problems.
This leaves many developers wondering where they will fit in the future of software development.
Micha Kaufman, CEO of Fiverr, offered an important perspective on how AI raises the bar for what’s considered “difficult”:

                              <span>If you’re facing an undefined reference error when using the Kvaser CanLib library in C with CMake, you&#x27;re not alone. Many developers encounter similar issues when they are new to using external libraries. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore why these errors happen and provide detailed steps to resolve them.
Understanding the Undefined Reference Error
The undefined reference error, like the one you&#x27;re encountering with canOpenChannel, usually indicates that the linker isn&#x27;t able to find the definition of a function or variable that you&#x27;ve declared in your code. This can happen for several reasons:
Missing Library Files: The specified library (in this case, canlib32.lib) might not actually contain the function definitions.
Incorrect Linking: It may be a problem with how the library is linked in …</span>

Are you talking to a human or a chatbot? What does it matter? By 2025, the world is filled with people having conversations with AI chat bots that there is no more need to command it to let you know or be assured that what you&#x27;re hearing isn&#x27;t coming from a real human. These AI companions have become more than just tools from which to garner conversation - they have literally transformed into companion-type resources - developing identities, tones of voice and communicative styles all their own. It&#x27;s less about physical function and more about the companionship endeavor.
As 2025 progresses, chat systems grow fancier and fancier. It&#x27;s not merely technological advancement that has these machines …</span>

In 2025, the evolution of conversational AI has accelerated to a point where the line between human and artificial interaction continues to blur in fascinating - and sometimes unsettling - ways.
The latest generation of AI chatbots doesn&#x27;t just respond to your queries; they understand context, remember your preferences, adapt to your communication style, and even engage in the full spectrum of human conversation - from intellectual debates to flirty banter and everything in between.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

In a May 9 letter to a Manhattan federal court, prosecutors opposed a request for a hearing, claiming they handed over “all known substantive communications” between them and the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) regarding Samourai “months in advance of pretrial motions and trial.”
“The defendants will have seven months to make use of the information before trial,” they wrote. “Nothing more is warranted.”

Uniswap founder Hayden Adams noted the achievement in an X post on May 12, which included a screenshot of a Dune Analytics dashboard counting down to the milestone. 
Uniswap also has a current daily volume of $3.3 billion, according to Dune. DeFillama meanwhile shows Uniswap is the leading DEX with a 23% market share in daily volumes, which it reports as slightly lower at $3 billion over the past 24 hours. 
The second-largest DEX in volume is PancakeSwap, with $2.7 billion and a 21% DEX market share.

DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.
Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.

There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now.

“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.

“One of our contracted moderators had their account compromised, which allowed a malicious bot to post scam links in one channel,” Ledger team member Quintin Boatwright wrote on the Ledger Discord server. 
“The issue was quickly contained: the compromised account was removed, the bot was deleted, the website was reported, and all relevant permissions were reviewed and secured.”
Some members in Ledger’s Discord channel claimed the attacker abused moderator privileges to ban and mute them as they tried to report the breach, possibly slowing Ledger’s reaction.…</span>

According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company&#x27;s products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.
As AI agents increas…</span>

Bitcoin analysis identifies the all-important price point to hold into the weekly close as all-time highs loom.


Liquidity is tightly clustered around current spot price, with $106,000 the likely next battleground.

Some traders are expecting the bid to enter price discovery to fail.

Bitcoin (BTC) preserved giant gains into the May 11 weekly close as analysis flagged the key level to hold next.

                              <span>Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.
Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.
Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”

                              <span>Worldcoin’s latest hardware, the Orb Mini, aimed at enabling portable human verification, has been met with ridicule across social media.
Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

                              <span>Altcoin markets are flashing early signs of a breakout, with several analysts calling for a potential surge over the next few months.
Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…</span>

The former UFC champion said he would discuss his plans in more detail in an upcoming X spaces, prompting responses from some of the Bitcoin industry’s most prominent leaders.
