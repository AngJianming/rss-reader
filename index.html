If you&#x27;re a student and haven’t tried Cursor yet, now’s the time. They just made their AI coding editor completely free for students. It’s like VS Code with an AI pair programmer built in and it actually understands your codebase (better than Copilot in my opinion!).
But here&#x27;s the thing. Tools like Cursor aren&#x27;t shortcuts to become a developer. They&#x27;re multipliers. If you take the time to really learn how code works, tools like this make you faster and more effective. If you skip that part, you might get output, but not insight. Learn to think in code first. Then use AI to move quicker.
I use Cursor myself while building sliplane.io, my platform for hosting Docker apps. It saves time, but only because I know what I want it to do. The real leverage comes from combining good tools with solid understanding.
Cheers,
Jonas Co-Founder sliplane.io</span>

                              <span>Introduction


Artificial intelligence (AI) has profoundly transformed software development. AI-based tools—often called AI agents—act as programming assistants, automating repetitive tasks and offering contextual insights. Recent studies show significant enthusiasm among developers: for example, a Salesforce survey found that 96% of programmers expect AI to improve the coding experience, and 80% already consider AI agents essential in application development. Additionally, users report increased satisfaction and productivity: a GitHub survey found that 60–75% of Copilot users felt more fulfilled and focused on satisfying tasks, and 73% said the tool helps them stay in a productive flow. These numbers illustrate the growing role of AI in developers’ daily lives. In this context, we explore…</span>

                              <span>🧠 Difference Between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy in JavaScript


When we work with objects or arrays in JavaScript, we often need to copy them. But did you know there are two types of copies? 🧐
👉 Shallow Copy

👉 Deep Copy
Let’s understand both in simple words with a daily life example and easy code.
Imagine you have a recipe book 📖. You want to give the same recipe to your friend.
Shallow Copy → You give a photocopy of the recipe page, but it still points to your original notes at the bottom. So if you change your notes, your friend sees the change too. 📝➡️👯‍♂️


Deep Copy → You write down the recipe fully with your notes and give it to your friend. Now, your friend has a completely separate copy. Changes in your book won’t affect your friend’s copy. 📝➡️📄✍️

                              <span>Sometime this year, I came across an opportunity that caught my eye — the Kubernetes African Developer Training Program, supported by Andela, CNCF, and the Linux Foundation. I didn’t know what to expect, but I applied anyway, hoping for the best.
One day, I opened my email and saw the words: “Congratulations, you’re in!” I smiled so hard.

Why I Joined


I’m still figuring things out in tech. I didn’t start with a degree in computer science or a fancy job title. I just have a love for learning and a desire to grow. Kubernetes sounded complex, but also like something I needed to learn if I wanted to get better in cloud and DevOps.
So when I found this program, I decided to take the step, not because I knew everything, but because I was ready to learn.

Let&#x27;s examine why this happens and how we can optimize your database operations.
Understanding the Performance Issue
Your current code iterates over the result set and performs an insert operation for each row individually. While this approach works, it can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with larger datasets. Each insert incurs a round-trip to the database, which can add significant latency.
Why This Happens
The database needs to handle multiple connections for each insert, which can be time-consuming. Furthermore, starting and committing transactions for multiple insert actions separately increases th…</span>

                              <span>Hey there, Linux explorers! Welcome to Day 3 — today we’re diving deep into the magic of file and directory management. Creating, deleting, copying, and moving files might sound simple, but trust me — when you master these, you’ll save time, stay organized, and look like a pro. Let’s unlock the secret sauce behind commands like mkdir, touch, cat, rm, cp, and mv. Ready to level up? Let’s get to it!
Part 1: Building Your File Empire


It’s time to set up your file kingdom. Grab your tools and let’s create those files and directories like a boss!
1. mkdir – Build Your Directories Like a Pro!


Want to create directories? mkdir is your go-to command. Whether it’s one directory or multiple, mkdir will get it done in seconds.
Create a single directory:
mkdir new_project

                              <span>Think coding on the blockchain is rocket science? It’s not. This guide breaks down smart contracts in plain English — no prior blockchain knowledge needed.
A smart contract is just code that lives on the blockchain.
It automatically runs when specific conditions are met — no human, no admin, no delays.
Example:
If Alice sends 1 ETH to the contract, Bob receives 100 tokens.
Smart contracts are:
🧠 Self-executing
📜 Transparent (everyone can see the code)
🔒 Tamper-proof
And you write them in a language called Solidity (think: JavaScript, but for Ethereum-based chains like Arbitrum).

                              <span>Thinking about starting your own radio channel? You’re not alone. Thanks to online tools and affordable tech, it’s never been easier to start an internet radio channel from home or your laptop. But here’s the thing — it’s also surprisingly easy to underestimate what’s involved. I learned that the hard way. So, before you dive in headfirst, here are five things I wish I’d known before launching my own radio station.
When I first planned my internet radio channel, I thought a good playlist would be enough. I was wrong. Listeners crave variety — not just in music genres but also in the type of content you offer. Think talk shows, interviews, listener call-ins, themed music hours, or news breaks.
Mix up your programming. Even if you focus on one niche (like indie rock or jazz), sprinkle in art…</span>

                              <span>The Day My Code Turned Against Me


Picture this: It&#x27;s 3 AM, I&#x27;m on my fifth cup of coffee, and my codebase looks like it&#x27;s been through a blender. Bugs are popping up faster than I can squash them, and my sanity is hanging by a thread thinner than my remaining hair. Sound familiar? If you&#x27;re a developer, you&#x27;re probably nodding so hard your neck hurts.
But fear not, fellow code warriors! I&#x27;m about to share a tale of redemption, featuring an unlikely hero: ChatGPT, the AI language model that went from &quot;that thing everyone&#x27;s talking about&quot; to my personal bug-busting sidekick.
Now, I know what you&#x27;re thinking. &quot;Another AI hype story? Give me a break!&quot; But hang tight, because this isn&#x27;t your typical &quot;AI solved all my problems&quot; fairy tale. This is a nitty-gritty, honest account of how I used C…</span>

WLFI’s snapshot vote for a USD1 airdrop proposal is underway, and USD1’s market capitalization has continued to climb.
Launched in early March with a $3.5 million supply, USD1 has expanded into a market cap of $2.2 billion at the time of writing, leaving rival stablecoins First Digital USD (FDUSD), PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Tether Gold (XAUT) behind, according to data from CoinGecko.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”

                              <span>Several crypto-focused organizations — including Bitcoin (BTC) mining companies — are eyeing a US return, primarily driven by uncertain geopolitical tensions. Still, BTC miner Hive Digital Technologies is doubling down on the untapped potential of the Latin American (LATAM) market.
In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Hive Digital Technologies’ president and CEO, Aydin Kilic, said that Paraguay presents a compelling long-term opportunity equipped with “geopolitical stability, low-cost hydro energy, and a government open to foreign investment”.
Picking up from where Bitfarms left off
Hive acquired Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt (MW) Yguazú facility for $56 million in January. Phase one infrastructure of a 100 MW data center at the site was completed in April, supporting five exahashes per …</span>

Pectra went live on the Ethereum mainnet at the start of epoch 364032, May 7, 2025, at about 10:00 am UTC. The three main Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) included are EIP-7702, EIP-7251 and EIP-7691.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …</span>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” said Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

On May 7, the Tokyo-listed firm disclosed that it spent $53.4 million acquiring 555 Bitcoin (BTC) at an average price of $96,134. The company now holds 5,555 BTC, purchased for $481.5 million at an average price of $86,672 per Bitcoin, according to CEO Simon Gerovich.
The company also announced the issuance of another $25 million in zero-coupon ordinary bonds to fund its ongoing BTC buys. Since early 2024, the firm has raised over 35 billion yen ($244 million) through zero-coupon bonds and stock acquisition rights via its partner, Evo Fund.

                              <span>Movement Labs confirmed the termination of its co-founder, Rushi Manche, following controversy over a market maker deal that he brokered.
Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

                              <span>A hacker involved in the $4.67 million exploit of the decentralized finance lending protocol Voltage Finance in 2022 has moved some of the stolen Ether to Tornado Cash after a short hibernation. 
Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated.

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

                              <span>Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

                              <span>US Democrat lawmakers have launched a multi-angle attack on President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures with two bills and a subcommittee inquiry aimed at cutting his ability to profit from the initiatives.   
The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. 
If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description.

                              <span>Digital asset manager Bitwise has filed to list a spot Near exchange-traded fund with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, adding to a growing list of altcoins currently vying to win regulatory approval.
The Bitwise Near (NEAR) ETF will track the price movements of the NEAR token, minus expenses, through a traditional brokerage, Bitwise’s May 6 registration statement shows.
Bitwise named Coinbase Custody as the proposed custodian of the Bitwise NEAR ETF. The management fee, ticker and stock exchange it seeks to list on weren’t named yet.

                              <span>The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is seeking permission from the court to drop an appeal against prediction market Kalshi. The move could allow the platform to offer political event contracts to users without contest.
In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. 
The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

According to a May 6 Financial Times report, the crypto traders earned roughly $100 million from buying $2.6 million worth of MELANIA tokens before the public launch on Jan. 19. Shortly after Trump announced the memecoin launch on social media, the price surged from roughly $2.00 to $12.95 — a 550% increase. The traders reportedly sold their holdings within 12 hours.

The Fed may pause rates but inject liquidity. Crypto could rally as a recession hedge.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…</span>
