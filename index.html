                              <span>The Instagram account of former US rap trio Migos was hacked in an apparent attempt to blackmail Solana co-founder Raj Gokal.
On May 27, Migos’ Instagram account posted at least seven images seen by Cointelegraph, which have since been deleted. Two of the images appeared to depict Gokal holding up his passport and driver’s license, clearly showing the full details of each document.
The account’s hacker tagged Gokal in one of the images that apparently showed him with the caption “you should’ve paid the 40 btc,” while another image depicting Gokal said “it was only 40 btc.. should’ve paid.”
Another image posted by the account hacker shows what the caption claimed was Gokal’s wife holding up a driver’s license, while a further two images appear to be a dump of private information, including mobile phone numbers and email addresses.
The type of photos posted, where a person holds personal identifying documents in clear view of the camera with their face visible, are commonly used by crypto exchanges in Know Your Customer checks.
However, it is unknown where the photos seemingly depicting Gokal and his wife originated and how they ended up being used in the apparent blackmail attempt.
The Solana Foundation and Gokal were contacted for comment.
Gokal had posted to X on May 20 that attackers had “been trying to take control” of his email and social media accounts, warning his followers to be suspicious of any out-of-the-ordinary posts.

Attackers have been trying to take control of my email, social media, Google, Apple, etc. this past week. If you see anything suspect (token launch, soliciting funds, etc) that means they got through. 
be careful out there

                              <span>Michael Saylor, the executive chair of major Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, says institutions posting onchain proof-of-reserves is a “bad idea” that could pose security risks.
“The current, conventional way to publish proof of reserves is an insecure proof of reserves,” Saylor said when asked about institutions adopting the transparency measure at a May 26 event on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.
“It actually dilutes the security of the issuer, the custodians, the exchanges and the investors. It’s not a good idea, it’s a bad idea.”
Saylor didn’t answer whether Strategy would publish its proof-of-reserves when asked by Blockware Solutions head analyst Mitchell Askew whether his firm would do so.

“Understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, being able to reason and being able to plan complex actions, particularly planning hierarchically,” LeCun said.

The company hopes to buy another 590 Bitcoin (BTC) with the funds, increasing its total holdings to 1,437 BTC, the Blockchain Group said on May 26.
Bitcoin is trading at over $109,00, and at current prices, the Blockchain Group could buy 658 BTC with the total amount it raised, according to CoinGecko.
However, the company said only 95% of the proceeds from the issuance will be used to buy Bitcoin; the remainder is marked for “operational expenses and to pay management fees.”

                              <span>Hello everyone,
So, recently I have been learning Amazon EventBridge as part of my continuous cloud learning journey. I&#x27;m a DevOps engineer exploring how we can build event-driven architecture on AWS, and EventBridge felt like one of those underrated tools that deserves more spotlight.
In this post, I&#x27;ll walk you through what things I have learned about Amazon EventBridge in simple words.

Before directly learning about the tool, I first understood the concept of Event-Driven Architecture, like exactly what is it.
-&gt; In simple words, Event-Driven-Architecture is a software design pattern where services communicates asynchronously through events, allowing for flexibility or loose coupling.
You may think that okay, we got the concept of EDA, but what is an event actually here in EDA..

                              <span>Everyone uses Docker, but almost no one knows how to really debug a container.
No, I’m not talking about the usual suspects:
&#x60;docker logs&#x60; → often empty or useless

&#x60;docker inspect&#x60; → static snapshot

&#x60;docker exec&#x60; → can’t attach before the container dies

Sound familiar?
When your container crashes in production (but works fine locally), you end up in a loop: tweaking the Dockerfile, redeploying, and praying.
But there’s a better way.
docker events – The Secret Weapon
This little-known command streams real-time, low-level events straight from the Docker daemon. It exposes what docker logs won’t tell you.
Your container keeps restarting. The logs show nothing. Instead of guessing, run:
docker events --filter container&#x3D;

2025-05-04T18:20:01Z container create ...  
2025-05-04T18:20:02Z container start ...  
2025-05-04T18:20:03Z container health_status: unhealthy ...  
2025-05-04T18:20:04Z container kill signal&#x3D;SIGTERM  
2025-05-04T18:20:04Z container restart  

Boom. Now you see:
Health check failed → Container killed → Docker auto-restarted it
Your app logs? They won’t show this. The health check runs outside your main process.
Filter by time:




docker events --filter contaner&#x3D; --since&#x3D;&quot;30m&quot; --until &quot;2025-05-04T18:00:00&quot;  

docker events --filter container&#x3D; --since&#x3D;&quot;5m&quot; --format &#x27;{{json .}}&#x27; | jq


But What About Observability Tools?
Sure, Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki are great. But they won’t catch:
OOM kills before metrics are scraped
Failed volume mounts
Init containers that crash silently
Sidecars restarting in the background
docker events sees everything—in real time.

                              <span>How Programmers Can Earn More by Solving Real Problems Around Them


As developers, we&#x27;re often told that to make money, we need to build the next big startup, land a high-paying job at a tech giant, or become influencers in the dev space. But there&#x27;s a more grounded, human, and immediate path to financial freedom: look around you and solve real problems.
You don’t have to search far. Think about your friends, your family, your neighbors. What frustrates them daily? What tasks do they waste time on? What services do they wish existed but don’t?
These are goldmines for meaningful software. If you can create tools, automations, or even simple websites that improve someone’s day-to-day life, you&#x27;re not just adding value, you&#x27;re building something people are often willing to pay for.

App Engine isn&#x27;t outdated — it&#x27;s focused.
🚀 Why devs still love it:
1-click traffic split and rollback
Zero-downtime deploys with testable versions
Autoscaling from zero to thousands — in seconds
Standard vs Flexible: heartbeat vs hills
⚖️ Compared to Cloud Run &amp; GKE:
Faster start than GKE, simpler than Cloud Run
No containers to build or clusters to patch
Perfect for APIs, internal tools, and high-burst media apps
🌱 Bonus: scale-to-zero &#x3D; carbon and cost neutral for side projects

                              <span>Go still leads for blazing-fast servers with tiny deploys. Here’s how to do it right:
📌 What’s inside:
Serve HTML, JSON, and forms
Handle routes, methods, and URL parts
Log every request with middleware
Gracefully shut down on Ctrl+C
Zero dependencies — just net/http
💡 Extras:
Static binary under 10MB
Stateless requests, full control
Ready to plug into REST, GraphQL, or auth layers

🔐 What you’ll learn:
Set cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite
Store lookup keys only — real data lives on the backend
Encrypt &amp; sign with securecookie (AES + MAC)
CSRF protection done right
Stateless vs session auth: when to pick JWT, when not
💡 Bonus tips:
Kill a cookie with MaxAge: -1
How domains &amp; Path influence visibility
Avoid cookie tossing attacks

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin is stuck below $110,000 due to macroeconomic uncertainty and as Nvidia earnings anticipation caps risk appetite.

Strong spot BTC ETF inflows and Bitcoin options data are hints that US economic clarity could unlock BTC highs.

Investor sentiment improved on May 26 after US President Donald Trump postponed his retaliatory European Union 50% tariffs on imports. European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.
Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency industry groups are urging the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue formal guidance on staking, citing continued regulatory uncertainty for Web3 infrastructure providers, according to Allison Muehr, head of staking policy for the Crypto Council for Innovation, a trade group.
Clarifying the SEC’s position on staking has become a top priority for the crypto industry, Muehr said during Solana’s Accelerate conference in New York.
“We’re about 25% of the way there,” Muehr said. “The SEC has done more constructive engagement with us in the past four months than in the last four years, but we still don’t have formal staking guidance.”

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue.

Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers.

Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following six- and 12-month time period.

Trump Media and Technology Group, the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has rebuffed a report that it’s planning to raise $3 billion in a mix of equity and convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The Financial Times reported the company’s plan on May 26, citing six people briefed on the matter, but Trump Media told the outlet that, “apparently the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources.”
Trump Media did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

Bitcoin price is capped at the $110,000 level due to sellers and a decrease in spot volumes. Leverage use is driving current rallies into this resistance level.

Traders are watching today’s volumes to see if emerging intraday trends are followed at the US open on May 27.

Bitcoin (BTC) price staged a mild recovery over the weekend, but gains above $110,000 are being capped by selling. Data from Glassnode shows “net distribution” (selling) from the cohort holding more than 10,000 Bitcoin, but cohorts below this level have continued to accumulate.

In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.
The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. 
In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.
It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting …</span>

AI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. 
Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.
AI has a “bad data” problem
Humans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.
An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance…</span>

In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.

Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.

Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.

Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.

While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hyp…</span>

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

                              <span>Bitcoin’s recent all-time high may be linked to ongoing issues in the Japanese bond market, possibly signaling BTC’s growing recognition as a hedge against instability in the traditional financial (TradFi) system.
Bitcoin’s (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $112,000 on May 22, before retracing to change hands above $109,700 at the time of writing on May 26, Cointelegraph data shows.
While some attributed the rally to geopolitical developments, including US President Donald Trump’s announcement of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire talks on May 19, macroeconomic factors appear to be playing a larger role, according to market analysts.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.

Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.

They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.

They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). 

If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like…</span>

Solana&#x27;s $9.4 billion TVL is a 54% increase since April 7.

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. 

A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300.

Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following a broader altcoin market rally that also saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000. 
Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL hit all-time highs above $300?

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $1.5 million by 2030 in her firm’s “Bull Case” forecast. In a Feb. 11 video, Wood said the price would require BTC to grow at a compound annual rate of 58% over the next five years, largely fueled by increased institutional adoption.

Over 70% of XRP’s realized cap was accumulated near recent highs, echoing previous market top patterns.

XRP’s active address count has plunged over 90% since March 2025, signaling reduced transactional demand.

A falling wedge pattern points to a potential 25% drop toward key support at the $1.76 level.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.
