Bitcoin’s realized cap is beating records and has almost reached the $900 billion mark.

The market is laying the foundations for a “potentially significant price breakout,” new analysis says.

Profit-taking is not hindering the overall bull market rebound.

Bitcoin (BTC) is setting new all-time highs in network value as BTC price action eyes a return to six figures.
Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirms new record highs for Bitcoin’s realized cap.

Bitcoin realized cap reflects “growing conviction”
Bitcoin is worth more than ever in US dollar terms if its market cap is measured by the value at which the extant supply last moved onchain.
Known as realized cap, this figure has seen continued all-time highs since mid-April as BTC/USD stages a sustained recove…</span>

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.
And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily.

The leak included a MySQL database dump shared publicly online. It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows.  
Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.
LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused bi…</span>

The OCC added in a press release that financial institutions can also outsource bank-permissible crypto activities, including custody and execution services, to third parties in compliance with applicable law.

                              <span>Bitcoiners expect Bitcoin to soon break past $100,000 and potentially hit a new all-time high as US President Donald Trump is set to announce a trade deal with the UK.
Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

                              <span>A Texas House Committee has passed a Republican-backed bill to create a Bitcoin reserve, which now only needs a successful full floor vote before heading to the governor’s desk.
The Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency passed Senate Bill 21 with no amendments on May 7 in a 9-4 vote along party lines. The bill has already passed the Texas Senate, in a 25-5 vote on March 6.  
SB 21 would establish the “Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” controlled by the state’s comptroller — currently Glenn Hegar — who would be permitted to invest in digital assets that have obtained a market cap of at least $500 billion over the last twelve months, which would currently only include Bitcoin (BTC).

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…</span>

Core Scientific’s Q1 2025 results, published on May 7, saw it more than double its $210 million net income from the year-ago quarter, while its total revenue reached $79.5 million, missing Zacks analysts&#x27; estimates by 8.11%, and falling from its $179.3 million in revenues for Q1 2024. 
The firm’s primary source of revenue came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue, $3.8 million in hosted mining revenue, and $8.6 million in colocation, formerly listed as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting.

Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on May 7, which allows Arizona to claim ownership of abandoned digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications within three years.
The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.

“I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US.
Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.”

                              <span>Laravel provides a powerful way to manipulate model attributes using accessors and mutators. These allow you to format or transform data when retrieving or saving it to the database. With Laravel 12, the syntax for defining accessors and mutators has been updated to make it more concise and intuitive.
In this article, we’ll explore how to format dates using accessors and mutators with the new syntax introduced in Laravel 12.
Accessors: Modify how an attribute is retrieved from the database.


Mutators: Modify how an attribute is stored in the database.
For example, you can use an accessor to format a date when retrieving it and a mutator to ensure the date is stored in a specific format.
Let’s say you have a User model with a birth_date column. You want to format the date as d-m-Y (e.g., 2…</span>

import React from &quot;react&quot;;

export default Parent;

function Parent() {
  console.log(&quot;1&quot;);
  React.useEffect(() &#x3D;&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;2&quot;);
  }, []);

  return (
    
      Parent component
      
 {
    console.log(&quot;4&quot;);
  }, []);

  return Child component;
}



Try to guess what will be printed to console.
Answer

Some explanation:
Parent is parsed and rendered, without useEffect,
Child, when there is no more nested components is turn of async hooks
useEffect from children to parents.
Few more logs, probably related to dev mode.</span>

                              <span>TypeScript offers two powerful tools for defining the shape of data: type and interface. But what’s the difference between them, and when should you use one over the other?
In this post, we&#x27;ll cover everything you need to know about type vs interface, with examples, comparisons, and best practices.








  
  
  🔹 What is a type in TypeScript?


A type is a TypeScript feature used to define aliases for primitive types, unions, intersections, tuples, and object shapes.
type UserID &#x3D; string | number;

type Point &#x3D; {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};


&#x60;
Types are flexible and work well for complex structures like mapped types, unions, and intersections.
interface?


An interface is typically used to define the structure of an object. It supports declaration merging and is preferred for defining public APIs or class contracts.
ts

You can extend interfaces to create complex structures.

type vs interface


Here are some common guidelines:
Use interface when:
You’re defining the shape of an object or class
You want to benefit from declaration merging
You&#x27;re working with public APIs or React props
Use type when:
You need unions or intersections
You&#x27;re defining primitive aliases or tuples
You&#x27;re working with more complex type logic
&#x60;ts
type Admin &#x3D; User &amp; {
// Using interface
interface IAdmin extends IUser {

Both achieve similar results but may differ in behavior when extending or merging.

                              <span>🔮 What is Vibe Coding?
Vibe Coding is a new paradigm in development where software is created based on intentions rather than traditional syntax, using artificial intelligence. Instead of writing code, developers form &quot;vibes&quot; or intentions, which AI translates into a working application. This opens up new possibilities for creativity and faster development.
💡 How Does Vibe Coding Work?
Instead of coding with lines of code, the developer conveys a system of intentions—such as “create a button with this functionality” or “build a screen with these data.” The AI, trained on a large dataset of examples, can interpret the intentions and generate all necessary code and interface components to carry out the task. It’s like conversing with a machine where your job is to express the idea clearly.…</span>

                              <span>In this article, we will explore how to efficiently impute missing values in a Polars DataFrame, specifically focusing on customer ages across different years. This is a common data wrangling task in Python where having a complete dataset is crucial for accurate analysis. We will take a given DataFrame with incomplete values and transform it into a &#x27;square&#x27; format, ensuring that each customer ID has age entries for every year. Let&#x27;s dive into the problem and solve it using Polars.
Understanding the Problem
You may have encountered a situation where your DataFrame contains incomplete values. For example, consider the following Polars DataFrame, which comprises customer IDs, years, and corresponding ages:
import polars as pl

df &#x3D; pl.DataFrame({
    &quot;cust_id&quot;: [1, 2 ,2, 2, 3, 3],

SafeLine is a powerful open-source web application firewall designed to protect web applications from a variety of security threats. This guide walks you through deploying SafeLine using Docker Compose, configuring its environment file (.env), and running the required command to retrieve admin account login details after deployment.
Before deploying SafeLine, you need to set up a directory to store its configuration and resources. Replace  with your actual system username.

mkdir -p /home//docker/safeline
cd /home//docker/safeline


For example, if your username is techdox:

mkdir -p /home/techdox/docker/safeline
cd /home/techdox/docker/safeline


Download the SafeLine Docker Compose file:

For them, AI is not just a helpful assistant—it&#x27;s a tool that, if pushed, could do much more. This is where “DAN prompts” come into play.
“DAN” stands for “Do Anything Now.” These prompts are designed to trick AI models into ignoring their built-in ethical guidelines and restrictions. Essentially, they attempt to make the model adopt a freer, more rebellious persona that can bypass safeguards and provide otherwise restricted or dangerous information.
Initially developed out of curiosity or for fun, these methods have since become tools for abuse. DAN prompts are now seen as ways to &quot;unlock&quot; an AI’s hidden potential, often to access unethical or ille…</span>

                              <span>Creating a project using both Tailwind CSS and PrimeNG can lead to styling conflicts, particularly when Tailwind is imported after PrimeNG. This article explores why this happens and provides a step-by-step guide to resolving these issues effectively.
Understanding the Conflict
When you combine Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, with PrimeNG, a component library for Angular, you might encounter an issue where PrimeNG components lose their styles after importing Tailwind CSS. The reason behind this often lies in the specificity of CSS selectors and the order in which stylesheets are loaded. Tailwind&#x27;s utility classes and global resets might override PrimeNG&#x27;s styles.
Why Does This Happen?
CSS Specificity: Tailwind CSS applies utility classes with a higher specificity, which can in…</span>

Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
Tokenizing securities instead of providing direct exposure can offer several advantages: reduced costs by eliminating traditional financial infrastructure, enhanced accessibility, faster settlement…</span>

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide…</span>

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

                              <span>Strive Asset Management, founded by entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, has revealed plans to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company.
According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC).
The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities, a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. 
Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war ches…</span>

Bitcoin price hangs near $97,000 as traders await today’s FOMC minutes.

Bitcoin holding $95,000 as support is key for bullish price expansion in the short term.

Select altcoins are holding their respective support levels, opening the gates for a short-term rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to knock down the immediate resistance at $97,895 and challenge the all-important $100,000 level. Crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin are positive about further gains as they have acquired 81,338 Bitcoin over the past six weeks.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What&#x27;s holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech&#x27;s fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook&#x27;s dominance?
