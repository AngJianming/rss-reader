This additional version of the LivinGrimoire software design pattern is in Python and annotationless.
✔ Reduced cognitive overhead - No type bureaucracy to navigate

✔ True duck typing - If it behaves correctly, it integrates seamlessly

✔ Legacy environment support - Flawless operation in Python 2.7+ ecosystems

✔ Enhanced prototyping speed - Ideas flow unimpeded by type formalism  
LivinGrimoire is a software design pattern that absorbs skills with just one line of code needed to add a skill.
Skill Prioritization: Can prioritize skills against one another, pause and resume skills according to their priority.
Algorithm Queueing: Can queue algorithms while running other algorithms.
Concurrent Skill Engagement: Can engage several skills at once and engage the right skills.
Inter-Skill Communication: Skills can communicate with each other, pass data, and affect each other.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Interface is not used, making it applicable for all OOP programming languages.
Auxiliary Classes: Specialized for learnability and trigger management, with miscellaneous classes for time savings on common coding actions.
Multistep Algorithms: Can form multistep algorithms and abort algorithms while they run.
Built-In Skill Catalog: Features a built-in skill catalog (see wiki to learn more).
Dynamic Skill Management: Can use self-aware skills, enabling them to add or remove other skills while the program is running, similar to a command terminal (see AI hormones wiki).
Reflexive Skills processing: Enables immediate AI reactions to sensory input, allowing real-time reflex responses to critical inputs alongside structured thought processing.
Backseat Skill Execution: Allows continuous AI skills to temporarily go dormant when non-continuous skills are triggered, ensuring smooth execution flow, bypassing censorship, and maintaining adaptive responsiveness without abrupt interruptions (see backseat skills wiki).

                              <span>Coming back to typed 100% AWS Lambda API’s, I’m convinced the config module is an anti-pattern if you’re using TypeScript.
Been away from typed server-side for about 4 years. While the 1st I had ReScript on the back-end in Amplify, the rest of the companies I was at did JavaScript/Python. In those languages, dynamic, sleek, easy to use global variables are nice for smaller projects with quick deploys.
Like types? Nope; all the allure dynamic languages have for “use a global proces.env.NODE_ENV to grab some dev.json that is magically inherited from default.json” suddenly screams “Why is this all un-typed, un-parsed without Zod, not wrapped in a Result, and why is config not used via dependency injection? Globals… in 2025?”
Then you realize… you don’t even need anything beyond some simple types + 1 helper function, and you’ve got a type safe, environment aware configuration.
First define your default config, equivalent to config’s “default.json”.

Second, define your dev and prod config, extending the default (both in types and in values).

Finally, create a get method, passing in process so you can unit test it with a stub vs. using it as a global variable. An improvement would be to pre-parse NODE_ENV so you don’t need a default in the switch.

JavaScript, I’m fine with the config module. In TypeScript, it’s dangerous and shouldn’t be used in Node.js.</span>

                              <span>Have you ever build something for months… only to realize no one actually wants to use it?
That was us.
We had what we thought was a solid mobile app. The idea was validated. The features were there. But when we finally launched, the numbers just didn’t add up:
High drop-off during onboarding
Users signing up, but never coming back
Confused feedback like “I don’t get what I’m supposed to do”
At first, we thought it was a marketing issue. But turns out—it was our UX.
The Pain Wasn’t the Product. It Was the Experience.
If you’ve ever seen a user just stare blankly at your app screen and then close it, you know the pain.
So We Got Help—From People Who Actually Do This for a Living
Clear user journeys
Tiny details like button placement and loading feedback
Making sure users feel in control—not overwhelmed
That’s when we came across a UX team in Singapore called Codigo.
We weren’t even looking for an agency at first. But their UX case studies caught our eye—especially how they think through micro-interactions and user psychology. It wasn’t just design—it was experience strategy.
Why I’m Recommending Them (Even Though I Don’t Usually Do This)
We worked with Codigo because we needed real UX help, and they delivered. What I appreciated most:
They interviewed our users before designing anything
Their clickable prototypes were ready within weeks
Every feedback loop felt like a collaboration, not a handoff
Long story short: our bounce rate dropped, engagement rose, and people finally “got” the app.
What You Can Learn (Even If You Don’t Hire Anyone)
Don’t assume users think like you
Fancy UI means nothing without flow clarity
Test your onboarding with someone’s mom or uncle. Seriously.
Final Thought
They’ve worked with banks, startups, and even government apps. But most importantly, they get that UX isn’t a luxury—it’s the core of your product.

No fluff. Just good, human-centered design.</span>

I have taken the CS5O&#x27;s introduction to programming with python offered by Havard university, which I consider a wonderful experience on my programming journey. The issue is, I have built my final project which requires a graphical user interface, so I used python&#x27;s tkinter library and ttkbootstrap. But to my greatest surprise, when I copy-paste my final result, which I tested many times in my local editor (pyCharm), into their online editor for submission, I noticed that their online editor doesn&#x27;t support windows creation (tkinter and ttkbootstrap). My concern is, can I still move on to submit it? Will they consider it a valid final project or I need to change project. Your pieces of advice are welcome!</span>

As a neurologist, software engineer, and AI ethicist, I’ve come to realize that some of the deepest insights in our field don’t come from new tools or libraries — 
but from enduring principles that have been with us for millennia.
In this article, I pose a timeless question:
What can we, as modern technologists, learn from the ancient builders of the Egyptian pyramids?
You might be surprised how deeply the architectural mindset of ancient Egypt — forged in the sands of time — still resonates in today’s world of:
System design
Human coordination
Ethical foresight
These themes echo not only through ancient stone, but also through the codebases, AI models, and cloud infrastructure we build today.
Highlights from the Article
The Pyramids as the Original Distributed Systems
Codebases as Stonework
Neural Networks as Digital Pyramids

Join the Conversation
I invite fellow developers, data scientists, software architects, and AI ethicists to reflect on the following:
How do you incorporate long-term thinking in your software or AI system designs?
Have you ever drawn inspiration from ancient systems, history, or philosophy in your technical work?
Let’s work together to build technology that doesn’t just scale — but endures.

Friends don&#x27;t let friends have BitLocker enabled unless they activate it.
So, someone comes to me with a laptop - water damage, doesn&#x27;t power on, ect. It&#x27;s my job to simply take out the hard drive and grab whatever data I can.
Ok, no problem right?
It&#x27;s all fun and games until I remove the hard drive from the computer and try to access it. BitLocker. WHY. Why do you have BitLocker enabled if you didn&#x27;t activate it with your windows account?
Here is the hard truth:
If you have BitLocker enabled without activating it and something happens - like water damage - all the IT support in the world isn&#x27;t going to be able to get your data. 


When the hard drive is removed from the original device, BitLocker is triggered. But you will never know your key to get access to your own information unless you had previously activated your key. Your assorted data, important business information, and family photos are NOT SAFE. They will be lost.




Options: 
Save to the cloud
Do routine backups elsewhere
Disable BitLocker
Fully activate BitLocker
Do not live in limbo, you are playing with fire, only to the disadvantage of yourself!
I spent the entire day, trying to figure out how I could get the data for a loyal customer. You know how bad that sucks when you can&#x27;t even do the thing you are supposed to be able to do...
I tried anyways. I spent all day googling work-arounds and trying a few things. Massive waste of time. Even if they can log into their Microsoft account, they will not have their BitLocker key if it was not activated. 
Go forth now, and save everyone.</span>

The Importance of Consistency Across Platforms
Consistency is super important when you&#x27;re designing for different platforms. Think about it: users expect a certain level of familiarity no matter where they are interacting with your product. Maintaining a consistent look and feel builds trust and makes your product easier to use.
Here&#x27;s why it matters:
Brand Recognition: Consistent visuals reinforce your brand identity.
User Familiarity: Reduces the learning curve for users switching between platforms.
Improved Usability: Predictable interactions lead to a better user experience.
User Experience Considerations in Cross-Platform Design
User experience (UX) is not a one-size-fits-all deal. What works great on a desktop might be a total disaster …</span>

Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family&#x27;s stablecoin
Though a majority of members of the US Senate voted to advance a bill to regulate payment stablecoins on May 20, high-ranking Democrats are planning to propose an amendment to the legislation to address President Donald Trump’s connections to the cryptocurrency industry.

According to a report from My London, Jacob Irwin-Cline went out to a London bar and had several drinks before calling an Uber to take him home.
Cline said that he did not thoroughly check the details of the Uber ride on his phone and left with a random private cab driver resembling the Uber driver at first glance, but driving a different vehicle — a detail Cline would only discover after the incident.

Once inside the vehicle, the US tourist said the driver offered him a cigarette, which Cline said was likely laced with a rare and potent sedative drug called scopolamine. Cline added that the cigarette made him feel …</span>

The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP (XRP) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States&#x27; “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a years-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8.

Ives joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

                              <span>Crypto exchange Kraken is planning to offer non-US customers the option of trading tokenized US stocks, part of the company’s push to offer more traditional assets via tokenization.
The products will be offered through Backed, a new Kraken partner, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph. Tokens representing the stocks will be stored on the Solana blockchain due to its “unmatched performance, low latency and thriving global ecosystem,” the statement said.
“The whole point of crypto is that we&#x27;re able to see things very transparently,” Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi said during Solana&#x27;s Accelerate event on May 22. ”It&#x27;s decentralized.

                              <span>California Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the US House Financial Services Committee, has announced plans to introduce legislation “to block [Donald] Trump’s memecoin and stop his crypto corruption.”
In a May 22 notice, Waters said the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act of 2025 bill would be aimed at blocking the US president, vice president, members of Congress and their families from engaging in “crypto crime.” The US lawmaker referred to Trump and his wife, Melania, issuing personal memecoins in January, his family launching a stablecoin, USD1, through the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, and the president attempting to establish a national Bitcoin (BTC) reserve as his sons back a BTC mining venture.

Mixed results for US jobless claims fail to dent risk-asset enthusiasm.

Despite concerns over the bond market, Bitcoin and stocks enjoy stability at the start of the Wall Street trading session.

BTC price expectations remain lofty amid low volatility and a curious lack of profit-taking.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

                              <span>What if a financial system could run itself not by burning electricity, but by rewarding good behavior? That’s the promise of staking, a mechanism that powers many modern blockchains by turning users into network operators. 
In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here&#x27;s some of our money. We&#x27;re putting it down. We&#x27;re showing that we&#x27;re serious about doing this.”

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

                              <span>The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours.

On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchav…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.
“We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins — it’s just unregulated,” he added. “If we provide …</span>

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. 
Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”
Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many.
