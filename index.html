                              <span>An example of Class Free Object Oriented (CFOO) JS-code.


The last years my JS contains almost exclusively CFOO (actually the revealing module pattern). It&#x27;s a very elegant and relative simple and robust way to create &#x27;constructors&#x27; without the need for this or class syntax (aka class sugar). I&#x27;d like to share the idea here.
Constructors are created using factory functions, which return frozen objects. Factory functions may include (&#x27;inherit&#x27;) other factory instances. Variable privacy is guaranteed via closures.
The basic pattern is (note: variables/types are not checked here)
const helloWorld &#x3D; myConstructorFactory(myOtherConstructorFactory());
const universe &#x3D; helloWorld(&quot;universe&quot;);

console.log(String(universe));
// &#x27;hello world&#x27;
console.log(String(universe.setWorld(&quot;universe&quot;)));
// &#x27;hello universe&#x27;
console.log(String(universe.setHello(&quot;Hi&quot;)));
// &#x27;Hi universe&#x27;
console.log(universe.name);
// &#x27;universe&#x27;

universe.name &#x3D; &quot;nothing&quot;; 
// TypeError: Cannot set property name of [object Object] 
// which has only a getter
universe.instanceName &#x3D; &quot;nothing&quot;;
// TypeError: Cannot add property instanceName, object is not extensible

function myConstructorFactory(inherits) {
  let {hello, world} &#x3D; inherits;

  return function(instanceName) {
      const instance &#x3D; {
      get name() { return instanceName; },
      toString() {return hello + &quot; &quot; + world; },
      setWorld(value) { world &#x3D; value; return instance; },
      setHello(value) { hello &#x3D; value; return instance; }
    };

    return Object.freeze(instance);
  }
}

function myOtherConstructorFactory(hi, wrld) {
  return Object.freeze( {
    hello: hi || &quot;hello&quot;, 
    world: wrld || &quot;world&quot; } );
}

I created a simple, but more complete example @ stackblitz. Feel free to tinker with it.</span>

                              <span>Currently, you can consider buying digital assets - memecoins. They combine a trend in pop culture and cryptocurrency. The investment tool was created as a reflection of the reaction to some aspects of life and did not have much value. I want to draw your attention to the fact that this is not investment advice and you yourself bear the risks for your actions. In addition, trading memecoins has a high risk and it is best to trade cryptocurrency for beginners that is less volatile and is in the TOP 10 by capitalization.
Recently, more and more people are starting to take this crypto seriously and are considering it for their investments. They will not be as popular as Bitcoin or Ethereum, but they can become part of an investment portfolio. Therefore, it is worth considering the more popula…</span>

                              <span>It all started with a personal pain point: juggling frontend and backend code in separate repositories. The constant back-and-forth became quite tedious, and I knew there had to be a better way. That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon the concept of monorepos.
Interestingly enough, my exploration coincided with a deep dive into trunk-based development on YouTube. One video mentioned Google&#x27;s massive 86TB monorepo powered by their internal version control system, Piper, and their open-source build tool, Bazel (or Blaze, as it&#x27;s apparently called internally, a detail I spotted in the source code!).
Being the curious soul I am, I immediately wanted to understand how their CI/CD magic worked. Bazel, however, proved to be quite the beast with a steep learning curve. Countless hours were spent binge-watchin…</span>

In this post, I’ll break down the end-to-end lifecycle of a Machine Learning project, including where MLOps fits in.
Here’s a high-level look at the typical stages in a production-ready ML workflow:
Problem Definition



What&#x27;s the goal? Predict churn? Classify images? Detect fraud?
ML might not even be the right solution — business context matters.
Data Collection



Raw data from logs, APIs, sensors, databases.
Often messy, incomplete, or biased.
Data Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing



Handle missing values, outliers, encoding, normalization, etc.

Recently I joined the gamedev.js 2025 gamejam. We got 13 days of dev time, from witch I could only code about 3 or 4 days as I had other responsibilities to consider, I had to make some shortcuts in order to still get a game out this year.
Luckily I bumped into the Advanced P5 Platformer Engine using P5 and Matter.js some time ago. And I as I always wanted to dip my toe into the Matter.js physics library, this seemed like a good opportunity to do so.
After some crunch time: adding new features, levels and graphics code, I named the game Momentum and released it. 
As the first feedback came in, I came to a horrible realisation, not everybody had the same experience while playing it. For some it was horribly fast to the point it was unplayable. 
I shipped the game with a critical bug…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Detecting the operating system&#x27;s preferred color scheme for dark or light modes is crucial for modern web design. Users on Windows and macOS now enjoy an aesthetically pleasing experience with dark mode features. By leveraging CSS and JavaScript, developers can create websites that adapt to users’ preferences, enhancing user experience while maintaining readability.
Understanding the Prefers-Color-Scheme Media Feature
In CSS, we can use media queries to detect if a user prefers a dark or light color scheme. The following snippet demonstrates how to use the prefers-color-scheme media feature:
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    color: white;
    background: black;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    color: black;
    background: white;
  }

Wooden fences bring warmth and rustic charm to properties, but they’re also prone to deterioration due to weather, pests, and aging materials. Traditional inspections are often reactive, only discovering issues when they’re already costly. This is where the power of modern technology, particularly Internet of Things (IoT) and solar energy, can revolutionize fence maintenance.
Wood deteriorates from exposure to sunlight, moisture, mold, and insects. Over time, posts may weaken, boards may rot, and structural integrity may falter. Monitoring the p…</span>

                              <span>In an age where data is currency and compliance is king, the cloud has become a double-edged sword. The promise of global scalability and agility often clashes with the growing demand for data sovereignty. Enter sovereign cloud services—and alongside them, technologies like Tanzu Spring and the new Spring AI project that help developers innovate without compromising compliance.
In this post, we’ll unpack what sovereign clouds are, why they matter more than ever, and how tools like Tanzu Spring and Spring AI support modern development inside highly regulated, nationalized environments.
A sovereign cloud ensures that data is stored, processed, and managed within a nation’s borders, under the jurisdiction of local laws, with no exposure to foreign regulations like the U.S. CLOUD Act.

As I&#x27;ve been exploring Kotlin, it&#x27;s come to become my favorite programming language. I built the benchmarks application in Kotlin, and included Kotlin as one of the languages it compares against. In this post, I want to share my thoughts on Kotlin&#x27;s performance and how it compares to other languages.
Kotlin JVM ranks last. And it&#x27;s not close.

At first, I thought this was a fault on my part. Maybe I was measuring the wrong thing, or maybe I was using the wrong libraries. But after some investigation, I found that Kotlin&#x27;s performance is consistently lower than the rest of the languages in the benchmarks. I even decided to turn on compiler optimizations for this language…</span>

                              <span>Summer Mersinger, one of four commissioners currently serving at the US financial regulatory body Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will become the next CEO of the digital asset advocacy group the Blockchain Association (BA). 
In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would be stepping down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2. Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the Association said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.
The departure of Mersinger, who has served in one of the CFTC’s Republican seats since 2022, opens the way for President Donald Trump to nominate another member to the financial regulator. Rules require that no more than three commissioners belong to the same political party. 
Like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CFTC is one of the significant US financial regulators whose policies impact digital assets. Lawmakers in Congress are currently working to pass a market structure bill to clarify the roles each agency could take in overseeing and regulating crypto.

A Biden nominee, Mersinger has called for standardized crypto-related policies and said the CFTC was the “ideal regulator for the cryptocurrency spot market.” Some expected she would lead the regulator following the election of Donald Trump and the departure of CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam, but Commissioner Caroline Pham took on the role in an acting capacity in January.

Despite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. 
Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. 
Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. 
The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private …</span>

According to a May 14 France24 report, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has invited crypto professionals to meet him after a brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.
”I will assemble businesspeople working in cryptocurrencies, and we have a few of those in France, at the interior ministry to work with them on their security,” Retailleau reportedly told the Europe 1/CNews broadcaster.
On May 13, three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter while she was walking in Paris’ 11th district with a man and her son. The attackers…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Fake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.

Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.

The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.

The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.
Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam.

In a recent op-ed for the Kazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper, Tuleushin said digital mining and smart policy shifts could position Kazakhstan as a regional leader in blockchain innovation.
“If all restrictions were lifted and digital asset trading was allowed across Kazakhstan, the impact could be significant,” he wrote.  
“Kazakhstan might become Central Asia’s crypto hub,” Tuleushin added, suggesting that broader legalization and taxation could add hundreds of billions of the country’s tenge currency to the national budget.

“Gold is getting very popular,” Amy Lo, the Swiss bank’s co-head of wealth management for Asia, said during Bloomberg’s New Voices event held in Hong Kong on May 13.
She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.

Bitcoin miners have stopped selling their BTC in what may signal the end of a lengthy distribution streak.

Over the past month, miner wallet balances have increased by around 2,700 BTC.

Hash Ribbons data shows good times continuing for both miners and BTC price strength.

Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation by miners is back as network participants swap selling for hodling at $75,000 lows.
Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that miners are now actively adding to their BTC reserves.

“Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.”

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. 
But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.

                              <span>World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices.
World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.
Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.

The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.
However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.
PitchBook&#x27;s senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.
This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, Ge…</span>

Former Cred CEO Daniel Schatt and chief financial officer Joseph Podulka admitted to wire fraud as part of a plea deal with prosecutors, according to a May 13 text filing in a California District Court.
District Judge William Alsup accepted the plea deals and set a sentencing hearing for Aug. 26. Wire fraud can carry up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for individuals and $500,00 for businesses.

The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.

The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.

                              <span>A Colorado-incorporated firm has been linked to a Chinese illicit marketplace that has served scammers in Southeast Asia and has been used to channel billions of dollars worth of crypto.
The marketplace, called Xinbi Guarantee, has received $8.4 billion, primarily in Tether (USDT) stablecoin transactions to date, blockchain security firm Elliptic reported on May 13. 
Merchants on the Chinese-language, Telegram-based marketplace sell technology, personal data, and money laundering services to Southeast Asian scammers who target victims using pig butchering scams. 
On its website, Xinbi describes itself as an “investment and capital guarantee group company” and claims to operate through Xinbi Co. Ltd, a Colorado-incorporated company incorporated in 2022.

A brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, was foiled after the daughter and passersby reportedly fought off the kidnappers.
Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.
The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

Tether snapped up 4,812.2 Bitcoin (BTC) at $95,319 each and transferred it to an escrow wallet on May 9, Cantor Equity Partners disclosed in a May 13 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
It brings Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to 36,312 BTC, as Cantor Equity Partners holds 31,500 BTC on behalf of the firm, which will trade under the ticker XXI once the SPAC merger is complete.
Twenty One’s CEO, Jack Mallers, said on May 13 that they’re already in the approval process of the merger, but didn’t give an exact estimate on when the tran…</span>
