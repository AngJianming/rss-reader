                              <span>I use Google Maps a lot to find local shops and services — cafés, tattoo artists, yoga studios. But too often, their links lead to Instagram or Facebook pages, where I have to accept cookies, dodge login popups, or scroll past ads just to access basic info like opening hours or a portfolio. It’s frustrating. This kind of information should be public by default — not locked behind Meta’s walls.
This Isn’t What the Web Was Meant For.
Small businesses deserve better than to have their storefronts locked behind walled gardens.
And people deserve access to that info without handing over their data to Meta.
They should publish it on a bluesky account instead!
I’m working on hopefully.blue — a new tool that gives small businesses a clean, Bluesky-powered profile page. Think Linktree meets Micro.blog, but for Bluesky.
Your business posts to Bluesky. We generate a public-facing profile that lives outside Meta/ X (any other big corp). No login needed. No cookies. Just your info, presented beautifully.
Your bio and pinned post become your “About” section.
Your latest photos show up on the side as an image wall.
It&#x27;s free 
It’s fast, privacy-friendly, and 100% public.
Here are a few examples:
spencer 🦈, a Marine Biologist 
Ahoy Conference
Malika Favre
404media 
Apollonia Saintclair
It works with any Bluesky account (You can find mine here ) - all the data is loaded behind the scene (thanks to their amazing API) and hydrates a Sveltekit frontend app.
It&#x27;s available in five languages (using paraglideJS).
Give it a try and let me know how that works for you in the comments below! 
Long live the open web!</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re a student learning how to code, you&#x27;ve probably come across GitHub Copilot—an AI tool that helps you write code faster, smarter, and with fewer errors. It acts like an intelligent pair programmer that can suggest entire lines or blocks of code as you type. But like many premium tools, GitHub Copilot normally comes with a monthly subscription fee.
If you&#x27;re diving into development tools as a student, it’s not just GitHub Copilot you should check out. Apidog is another must-have for your toolkit — especially if you&#x27;re working on APIs.

Luckily, if you’re a student, you can use GitHub Copilot completely free through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. In this article, we’ll explain what GitHub Copilot is, how to apply for the student pack, and how to make the most of Copilot once you…</span>

                              <span>Backend developers are always looking for new tools and approaches to make apps more efficient and secure, while cutting costs for clients. In 2025, there are several key trends that reshape backend development services. In this article, we share our thoughts on top backend trends and experiences related to some of them.
Serverless architecture is an approach that allows developers to create an app’s backend without assembling and managing its infrastructure. This architecture automatically scales with demand, reduces operational costs, and allows app owners to pay only for the resources they use. This backend trend is evolving rapidly, with major platforms like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions leading the charge.

                              <span>Back when I was studying at the College of Engineering, Trivandrum (Any CETians here?), during my MCA days, we had tons of fun in our hostel rooms. Only one of us had a UPS for his computer, so whenever there was a power cut, we all gathered in his room. His screen was the only one lit up, and we’d play a Flash game called Hangaroo—a Hangman clone where you had to guess the word before the kangaroo met its fate! Those memories still bring a smile to my face.
When I came to know about the Q CLI Game Challenge, I immediately knew what I was going to build - a recreation of dear old Hangaroo! 
Q CLI is a wonderful coding assistant that natively works in your terminal. I was able to build 90% of the functionality with just one prompt. Then I spent a couple of hours tweaking the looks and gamep…</span>

                              <span>Spring Boot provides a rich programming model to handle transactional events efficiently. One such powerful feature is the TransactionEventListener, which allows you to react to transaction lifecycle events like commit or rollback, enabling clean separation of concerns and robust transaction-aware event handling.
In this post, we&#x27;ll dive deep into what TransactionEventListener is, how it works, explore real-world scenarios where it shines, and also discuss its limitations and challenges.
TransactionEventListener?


TransactionEventListener is an annotation in Spring Framework (since 5.2) that lets you listen to events within the context of a transaction. It means your event handling logic can be triggered only after a transaction successfully commits, or when it rolls back, providing preci…</span>

  🔹 Problem: Divisible and Non-Divisible Sums Difference


Difficulty: Easy
Tags: Math
We have to find the difference between the sums of two arrays num1 and num2, with elements from 1 to n. num1 contains numbers not divisible by m, and num2 contains numbers divisible by m. The result should be the difference between the sums of num1 and num2.
Brute Force Idea:
Iterate through both arrays, calculate the sums while checking divisibility, and return the difference.
Time Complexity: O(n)
But as this is a math problem, I thought there might be a faster way to solve it.

export class sendMessageDTO{

    @IsString();
    @IsNotEmpty()
    message:string;

    @IsMongoId();
    user:Mongoose.ObjectId;

}

Some useful Class Validator Decorators
@IsString()
@IsNotEmpty()
@IsMongoId()
@IsNumber()
@IsEmail()
@IsBoolean()
@IsDate()
@IsArray()
@IsEnum()
@IsOptional()
@isin()
@IsInstance()
@IsObject()
@IsUrl()
@IsUUID()
@IsDateString()
@IsNumberString()
@IsAlpha()
@ValidatedNested()
@IsAlphanumeric()
Class Transformer : It converts plain JS Object into class instance.





    // This will convert req.body into sendMessageDTO instance.
    // And then we can use class validator to validate it.

ABSTRACT 
INTRODUCTION
Artificial Intelligence History 
Since ancient philosophers were debating life and death in the early 1900&#x27;s, the concept of artificial intelligence existed. During this time ancient philosophers and innovators created mechanical devices called automatons that operated without human help. 
AI Development In The 20th Century
In the early 20th century from 1900 to 1950, a huge number of media researched the concept of artificial brain. This made scientists interested in AI and they started to inquire more information. Is the creation of an artificial brain possible? It sparked alot of interest then among this scientist. Inventors begin to create primitive models which we know as robots now. The term robot was introduced by …</span>

                              <span>Burnout doesn’t always look like exhaustion.
In today’s remote-first development culture, most teams think they’re “avoiding burnout” just because their people aren’t clocking 80-hour weeks or complaining. But burnout isn’t always loud. Often, it’s silent, cumulative, and invisible—especially in distributed engineering teams.
🔍 What Developers Are Actually Burning Out From
🌀 Context switching 12 times before lunch
📆 Endless meetings that should’ve been comments
😶‍🌫️ Lack of visibility into the team’s real goals
⏳ Deliverables without clarity on “why now?”
🧱 Tech debt and patchwork systems that slow down deep work
🤐 Feeling invisible unless they’re overcommunicating
The irony? Many of these are management issues disguised as engineering problems.
🧱 Remote ≠ Async ≠ Healthy
True async culture supports:
Fewer interruptions
Clear documentation
Decision logs instead of meeting notes
Autonomy in execution
Trust in outcomes, not constant check-ins
At CorporateOne, we help teams build virtual environments where this kind of thoughtful work can actually happen.

Train Managers in Cognitive Load Awareness
Yes, managers need training too. Not on “burnout theory”—but on how engineering minds actually work.
🔁 Rethink Burnout Before It’s Too Late
It’s time to redesign not just how we code, but how we work together—remotely and sustainably.

So I’ve been building a small demo called “AI-Bae or Nay” — a swipe-style game that plays with the idea of love in the age of LLMs.
The concept:
There’s no fancy UI or images (yet!) — just text, vibes, and chaos.
Why I made it:
Can Gen Z actually tell what’s real in the digital dating scene anymore?
So I decided to test it.
Each profile you swipe comes with:
✍️ A short bio
🎯 A few interest tags
🤖 A chat option powered by Amazon Q CLI + Python
And then:

)

It’s early-stage — but I think it hits a nerve.
And I wanted to make something that lets us play with that line — literally.
If you’d like to test it out or even co-build it with better visuals, photos, or logic — hit me up 👾
This one’s still cooking, but I had to share it anyway.

In HarmonyOS app development, state management is the core capability for synchronizing data between pages and sharing global variables. Since ArkTS V2, the official state management mechanism has been comprehensively upgraded, providing a more efficient and user-friendly global state management solution. This article combines the official migration guide and practical project experience to systematically explain the migration from V1 to V2, unified global variable management, global state listening and notification, and best practices.
Official detailed migration guide: ArkTS State Management V1-V2 Migration Guide

It is recommended to compare the project structure before and after migration, using git branches or new projects for comparison.

Tool
Role




CodeCommit
Git repository for source code


CodeBuild
Builds the Spring Boot app and outputs the .jar



CodePipeline
Orchestrates source → build → deploy stages


Elastic Beanstalk
Deployment environment




Source (GitHub Repository)


The pipeline starts when a code change is pushed (commit) to your GitHub repository.
This event triggers the pipeline automatically — no manual deployment needed.
Build Phase (CodePipeline + CodeBuild)



AWS CodePipeline detects the commit and initiates the CI/CD process.
It hands over the code to AWS CodeBuild, which:

Cetus was exploited for over $220 million worth of digital assets on May 22. Shortly after the incident, Cetus managed to freeze $162 million of the funds.
In a May 27 post on X, Sui said Cetus had requested a community vote to approve the recovery of the frozen funds. 
“If the community vote is approved, the funds will be recovered from the attacker and held in a multisig trust account until they can be returned to accounts that had positions in Cetus,” the post said.
The vote is part of a broader recovery plan that includes using Cetus’s treasury and securing an emergency loan from the Sui Foundation.

In a May 28 announcement, the company said it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value.
Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin (BTC) buys.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.”

“They are literally on the bottom,” van de Poppe added before stating that the “final easy 12-24 months are coming.” While many altcoins have posted gains over the past 30 days, they remain below their levels from the market uptrend until US President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

                              <span>Jack Dorsey’s financial services firm Block, Inc. will launch Bitcoin payments on Square, its payments processing arm, with a rollout to begin later this year before a full launch in 2026.
The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store.
Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin (BTC) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. 
“Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. 
The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals.

“The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3,” Bitfinex analysts said in a May 28 markets note.
Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy”
Bitcoin (BTC) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22; however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter. 
“A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher,” the analys…</span>

                              <span>Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.
Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.
Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.

The stock market’s May 23 19b-4 filing, which asks the SEC to list the 21Shares SUI ETF, follows 21Shares’ April 30 submission of its S-1 registration statement to the SEC, which asked the regulator to approve trading of the proposed fund.
Both regulatory filings are needed for the Sui (SUI) tracking fund to go live, with the 19b-4 filing kicking off the SEC’s review process. The agency must decide whether to accept, reject or delay the application within 45 days and it can delay its decision multiple times, for a maximum review period of 240 days.

SharpLink Gaming establishes the first ETH treasury, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. 

Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. 

Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum treasury company.
Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire Bitcoin (BTC).

33-year-old William Duplessie was taken into custody by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and will be charged with “kidnapping and false imprisonment of an associate,” NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
The incident comes amid a string of kidnappings and ransom attempts targeting crypto investors and their loved ones, prompting additional security measures from investors and industry executives.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.
According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. 
He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time…</span>

In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market.
Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.”
“So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding:
“The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.”

                              <span>Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services.
According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.
The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their B…</span>

Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears.

Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside.

Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s (BTC) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions.

Bitcoin could turn parabolic if prices move above $115,000 to liquidate more than $7 billion in short positions.

Onchain indicators enter overheated territory, suggesting prolonged profit taking from BTC investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) showed strength on May 27, briefly tagging $110,700 after a strong US equities market open and the Trump Media and Technology Group’s announcement that it would raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. 
Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics.

Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.
As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.
The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every fou…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum has reclaimed a key level that preceded 100%+ rallies and triggered past altseasons.

Altcoin market cap could surge toward $15 trillion if Bitcoin dominance repeats its post-halving drop.

Despite bullish signals, ETH remains fragile, with $123B in supply near cost basis at risk of flipping into a loss.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), has reclaimed a key technical level that has historically preceded sharp price gains and marked the start of an “altseason” across multiple market cycles in the last five years.
ETH price can double in the coming months
