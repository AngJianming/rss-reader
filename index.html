                              <span>Hi Dev.to,
I&#x27;m Dylan Clément, a full-stack developer and designer. Over the last few months I’ve been working on something called Jolyo, a web platform built specifically for indie game developers who are tired of juggling a million tools.
Like many in the game dev scene, I found myself constantly switching between Trello for tasks, Notion for docs, Google Drive for assets, Discord for team chat, and itch.io for visibility. It worked, sort of. But it was messy and inefficient.
So I started building Jolyo, a platform that brings all these essentials together in one place, with game creators in mind.
Jolyo is a web-based workspace for managing game development projects. It centralizes everything: tasks, documentation, team collaboration, and community sharing.

                              <span>Mastering Git from the inside out—what every developer should know.
Git isn’t just a version control system—it’s a content-addressable key-value store with an elegant and powerful object model. Understanding this model enables advanced usage, more efficient workflows, and better debugging.
Git stores everything in its .git/objects/ directory using SHA-1 hashes as keys and compressed content as values.
echo &quot;Hello Git&quot; | git hash-object -w --stdin

This command stores a blob (file content) and returns its SHA-1 hash.
Git’s internal model revolves around four object types:



Type
Purpose




blob
Stores raw file content (not filename).


tree
Represents directory structure.


commit
Points to a tree and includes metadata and parent commits.

                              <span>In the Go programming language, we often see the use of the underscore (_), such as using it as a placeholder to ignore unwanted variables, importing packages solely for their side effects, or ignoring variables in type conversions. However, most people may not have encountered the use of an underscore within a struct—specifically, defining a struct field named _.
So, what is the purpose of defining such a field?
_) Fields


First, let&#x27;s look at an example of a struct without an underscore (_) field.
In the model package, we define a User struct with two fields: Name and Age.
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

We declare struct variables using both positional and named field initialization.
user :&#x3D; model.User{&quot;Alice&quot;, 18}
user &#x3D; model.User{Name: &quot;Alice&quot;, Age: 18}

Your team ships a new feature. Everyone high-fives. Six weeks later, usage data comes in.
Nobody&#x27;s using it.
Why? Because we build what WE think customers want, not what THEY actually need.
This guide shows you how to fix this problem by combining two powerful frameworks:
Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD): Discover what customers truly need
Objectives and Key Results (OKRs): Measure outcomes that matter
Let&#x27;s dive in.

People don&#x27;t buy products. They hire them to make progress in their lives.
This isn&#x27;t just semantic wordplay. It changes everything.

Greetings OSSRH Publisher,
As you may have heard, OSSRH is reaching end of life on June 30, 2025. OSSRH users need to migrate their namespaces to the Central Portal as soon as possible.
Instructions for self migration are located here: https://central.sonatype.org/faq/what-is-different-between-central-portal-and-legacy-ossrh/#self-service-migration
To make the transition smoother we will be automatically migrating publishers that have not used oss.sonatype.org or s01.sonatype.org to publish artifacts in some time starting with the oldest and working our way forward. To avoid disruption to your publishing processes we strongly encourage migrating before the June 30, 2025 deadline.
Thank…</span>

If you are encountering the dreaded &#x27;Failed to package&#x27; error with the message &#x27;Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code&#x27; while building your Flutter application for iOS, you&#x27;re not alone. Many developers face this issue, particularly after updating their Flutter SDK or CocoaPods. Understanding the root cause of this problem and following a systematic approach to resolve it can save you time and frustration.
Why This Error Occurs
The error indicates that there is an issue in the build phase of your iOS application. This typically happens due to the following reasons:
Outdated CocoaPods: If your CocoaPods are outdated, they may not be compatible with your Flutter project.
Pod Installation Issues: Sometimes, improperly installed pods can lead to build failure…</span>

                              <span>When working with shell scripts, you&#x27;ve likely encountered the mysterious #! line at the top. But what does it do? In this post, we&#x27;ll explore the Shebang, its purpose, and best practices for using it in your shell scripts.
What is the Shebang?
The Shebang, also known as Hashbang or &quot;sha-bang&quot;, is a special sequence of characters (#!) that specifies the interpreter to use when running a script directly. It&#x27;s typically followed by the path to an interpreter, such as /bin/bash or /usr/bin/env bash.
How Does the Shebang Work?
When you run a script directly (e.g., ./my_script.sh), the operating system&#x27;s program loader reads the Shebang line to determine which interpreter to use. The interpreter is then responsible for executing the commands within the script.

Siemens is forging ahead with a revolutionary approach to software licensing by introducing decentralized licensing. In this post, we explore how Siemens leverages blockchain technology and peer-to-peer networks to enhance security, transparency, and scalability in software management. We review the background of decentralized licensing, discuss its core concepts and features—including blockchain, smart contracts, and peer-to-peer networking—and analyze its applications, challenges, and future trends in the context of Industry 4.0. In addition, practical examples, a comparison table, and curated insights from industry experts are provided to help you understand this innovation better.

However, one of their bigger downsides is the lack of accurate parse error reporting. Let&#x27;s take a look. Suppose you want to parse records of this format: 1 Bob ie an ID number followed by one or more spaces, followed by an alphabetic word (a name). Here&#x27;s a basic Angstrom parser for this:
open Angstrom

type person &#x3D; { id : int; name : string; }

let sp &#x3D; skip_many1 (char &#x27; &#x27;)
let word &#x3D; take_while1 (function &#x27;A&#x27; .. &#x27;Z&#x27; |&#x27;a&#x27;..&#x27;z&#x27; -&gt; true | _ -&gt; false)

In this post, we’ll explore how to properly set up multiple app initializers in an Angular 19 application, specifically when using the provideAppInitializer function to load configurations from a service.
Understanding App Initialization in Angular
Angular&#x27;s dependency injection system provides a way to delay the app&#x27;s bootstrap process until all necessary dependencies are ready. This is done through the application configurator, where you can specify initial functions to execute before the application begins.

                              <span>Tech company Meta is reportedly exploring integrating stablecoin payments into its platforms after a three-year hiatus from cryptocurrencies, Fortune reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.
The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report.
One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether&#x27;s USDt (USDT), Circle&#x27;s USD Coin (USDC) and others.
Meta is the latest tech firm to integrate or explore the use of stablecoins for payments, as they increasingly attract institutional interest and investment, causing the stablecoin market capitalization to soar past $230 billion.

Although the bill initially received bipartisan support from US lawmakers, Democrats opposed the bill last minute due to concerns over President Donald Trump pushing crypto policies for self-benefit.

                              <span>Coinbase’s agreement to buy Deribit highlights the increasing importance of financial derivatives for cryptocurrency exchanges, according to industry executives. 
On May 8, Coinbase, the US’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, agreed to acquire crypto derivatives platform Deribit for $2.9 billion in the crypto industry’s largest corporate acquisition to date.  
The deal reflects increasing competition among digital asset exchanges and brokerages — including Coinbase, Kraken and Robinhood — to dominate the burgeoning crypto derivatives market. 
&quot;Global derivatives trading is a key driver of growth for Coinbase,” Spencer Yang, co-founder of Fractal Bitcoin, a Bitcoin scaling solution, told Cointelegraph.

97% of the $8.3 billion in Bitcoin put options expire worthless at a $102,000 BTC price.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option. Traders now question whether Bitcoin is poised to break its $109,354 all-time high in the near term.

Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.
Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from President Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging. In addition to the UK trade deal, the US is set to meet with Chinese officials in Switzerland on May 10.

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering rule changes to let companies more freely issue tokenized securities, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce said in a speech published on May 8.
The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech.
For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously sent numerous Wells notices to DEXs such as Uniswap for allegedly failing to register as securities exchanges.

                              <span>Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

Bitcoin (BTC) reclaimed the $100,000 mark on May 8 at 3:22 pm UTC, surging 4.2% from the intraday low of $95,967, according to data from CoinGecko.
It marked the third time that BTC has broken through the six-figure level since first achieving it on Dec. 5, 2024. A second all-time high followed on Jan. 20 ahead of US President Donald Trump’s inauguration.

The approval was available on the public docket as of May 8, but appeared to have been removed at the time of publication.

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

                              <span>Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

                              <span>Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US by trading volume, has agreed to acquire Deribit, one of the world’s biggest crypto derivatives trading platforms.
Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8.
The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement.
“With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said.

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…</span>

Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.
The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.
