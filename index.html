                              <span>I recently aced an LLM engineer interview with a 9/10 score, and one of the tasks was designing a customer support chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here’s how I tackled it, building a scalable, privacy-focused system that delivers fast, accurate responses. Let’s dive into creating a RAG-based chatbot, step by step, with open-source tools and a user-friendly interface.

We are surrounded by people competing for visibility. In meetings, on social feeds, in public discourse. Volume and certainty have become currency. But every now and then, someone appears who commands attention by doing the opposite.
This piece reflects on one such moment. The appearance of Pope Leo XIV. Not as a religious event, but as a cultural one. A moment when silence said more than slogans. When presence outweighed performance.
In a digital world exhausted by noise, it feels like a rare reminder that stillness can still mean something.

                              <span>Pandemic Studios actually kicked off its own Star Wars Battlefront 3 right after Battlefront II, dreaming up seamless space-to-ground battles and next-gen tweaks for PS3/Xbox 360 – but LucasArts only gave them the same one-year window as the previous games. Between new hardware headaches and Lucasfilm’s marketing deadlines (Revenge of the Sith tie-ins, anyone?), the studio couldn’t nail a realistic timeline, and talks fell apart before they’d even built much more than a prototype.
Eventually LucasArts handed the series to Free Radical Design, whose version famously made it to about 95% before being canned too, and Pandemic shuttered in 2009. Decades later, EA’s 2017 Battlefront II still thrives, but a true Battlefront 3 remains as elusive as the Death Star plans.</span>

With the GroupDocs.Comparison Cloud Java SDK, developers can seamlessly incorporate advanced image comparison features into their Java-based applications with just a handful of REST API requests.
This cloud-driven REST API goes beyond simple visual matching. It enables you to programmatically compare images using Java, create comprehensive difference reports, and pinpoint visual alterations with pixel-level accuracy. Whether you are dealing with scanned documents, design updates, or visual assets, the SDK aids in automating and scaling your image comparison tasks efficiently and…</span>

                              <span>Turns out the Battlefront 2 crew is itching for a reunion. Developer Mats Helge Holm revealed that he—and a bunch of other ex-DICE devs—would love to “get the band back together” for a Battlefront 3, especially now that the 2017 shooter has enjoyed a fresh wave of popularity thanks to Reddit and TikTok communities. EA officially wrapped support in 2020, but fan enthusiasm is still going strong.
You might remember Battlefront 2’s rocky launch, when aggressive microtransactions locked heroes (like Darth Vader) behind roughly 40 hours of grind. EA eventually scrapped the system after massive backlash (Disney even got involved), and went on to drip out new heroes for free. Between that U-turn and the game’s killer graphics and gameplay, fans are now more hyped than ever for what a new sequel could bring.</span>

                              <span>Warhammer 40,000’s parent company Games Workshop just flexed its financial muscles, handing out a whopping £20 million (about $27 million) in bonuses to its 1,500-strong staff after yet another stellar year. Core revenue jumped to £560 million (from £494.7 million), core profit climbed to £210 million, and licensing profit hit £45 million—driving a pre-tax haul of £255 million. Each employee nets roughly £13,333 (≈$18,000).
Behind the success? The company’s classic miniatures business plus runaway hits in video games (Space Marine 2) and TV (Amazon’s Secret Level), not to mention a shiny new Henry Cavill–backed cinematic universe on the horizon. While licensing numbers likely won’t spike this high again next year, Warhammer’s tabletop and IP empires show no signs of slowing down.</span>

                              <span>Batch processing plays a vital role in many modern systems, especially for data processing, machine learning training, ETL, etc. Kubernetes, while historically designed for long-running services, has expanded its capabilities to support these batch workloads. With the help of specialized tools, Kubernetes has become a robust platform for handling resource-intensive and time-sensitive tasks.
In this blog post, we will dive into batch scheduling on Kubernetes, the challenges it entails, and compare three powerful open-source tools - Apache YuniKorn, Volcano.sh, and Kueue - that cater to batch scheduling needs.

Saqib’s appointment takes effect immediately under Rule 4(6) of the Rules of Business, 1973. He has been granted the status of minister of state and will serve without salary or official benefits, according to a May 26 report in the English-language local news outlet, Pakistan Observer.
The move follows a series of government initiatives aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s presence in the digital asset space. Just one day prior, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity exclusively for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers.

Solana&#x27;s $9.4 billion TVL is a 54% increase since April 7.

Solana’s memecoin daily trading volume has more than doubled since early April. 

A bullish V-shaped recovery pattern projects SOL price to rise toward $300.

Solana’s native token, SOL, surged 86% between April 7 and May 26, following the broader altcoin market rally that saw Bitcoin hit new all-time highs above $111,000. 
Since then, SOL has struggled to break above $180, but onchain and technical data still suggest further gains are in store for the altcoin. Can SOL follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps and hit all-time highs above $300?

In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. 
Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis.

US President Donald Trump has extended the deadline of a proposed 50% tariff on EU goods to July 9.

A temporary easing in trade tensions could help fuel Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price climbed back above $109,000 during the late trading hours on May 25, as traders responded to President Donald Trump’s decision to delay the implementation of tariffs on EU goods until July 9.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed that BTC rose by as much as 3.2% to an intraday high of $110,100 on May 26 from a low of $106,660 on May 25.

Over 70% of XRP’s realized cap was accumulated near recent highs, echoing previous market top patterns.

XRP’s active address count has plunged over 90% since March 2025, signaling reduced transactional demand.

A falling wedge pattern points to a potential 25% drop toward key support at the $1.76 level.

XRP (XRP) has rallied more than 385% since late 2024, but fresh onchain analysis warns that this surge may have attracted buyers at increasingly vulnerable levels.

Crypto projects allocate tokens for various purposes. For example, a company may promise tokens to team members to reward them for their contributions or sell them to early investors. However, projects usually lock the tokens for a specific period to prevent early holders from dumping before the project matures.

                              <span>A single victim was scammed two times within three hours, losing a total of $2.6 million in stablecoins.
According to data shared on May 26 by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the victim sent 843,000 worth of USDt (USDT), followed by another 1.75 million USDt around three hours later. Cyvers said the scam used a method known as a zero-value transfer, a sophisticated form of onchain phishing.

Zero-value transfers are an onchain phishing technique that abuses token transfer functions to trick users into sending real funds to attackers. The attackers exploit the token transfer From function to transfer zero tokens from the victim’s wallet to a spoofed address.
Since the amount transferred is zero, no signature by the victim’s private key is necessary for onchain inclusion. …</span>

On the menu at the May 22 event, which all paid millions to attend, was a “Trump organic field green salad”  followed by a filet mignon and pan-seared halibut with mashed potatoes and vegetable medley while a lava cake was dished up for dessert.
“The only good thing was bread and butter,” Pinto said, adding he left the venue still hungry.

Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.
OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.
“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.

The company plans to sell it for between $6,500 and $8,000 owing to its lower specifications and simple manufacturing requirements — cheaper than the some $10,000 to $12,000 Nvidia’s recently restricted H20 model sold for.

                              <span>Coinbase and two executives have been hit with another proposed class-action lawsuit over the crypto exchange’s stock price drop after disclosing a user data breach earlier this month and for allegedly failing to disclose a violation of an agreement with a UK regulator.
Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.”
Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier, with several of its customer support …</span>

                              <span>Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

Speaker Johnson shrugs off Trump crypto dinner concerns
US House Speaker Mike Johnson brushed off concerns on President Donald Trump’s dinner for the top holders of his memecoin when speaking to CNN on May 25 and dodged answering whether the attendees should be made public for transparency.
“We do not know who was there. The list has not been released. We do not know how much of the money came from outside the country,” CNN’s Jake Tapper told Johnson. “I really have a difficult time imagining that if this was a Democratic president …</span>

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
&quot;This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens.&quot;

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm&#x27;s fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.
Cardone told Cointelegraph the impetus to start the fund followed a suggestion from his brother. The CEO said:

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

                              <span>Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor signaled an impending Bitcoin (BTC) purchase by the company amid the recent dip from the all-time high of $112,000 reached on May 22.
&quot;I only buy Bitcoin with money I can&#x27;t afford to lose,&quot; Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company&#x27;s most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy&#x27;s total holdings to 576,230 BTC.
If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company&#x27;s seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today&#x27;s tran…</span>

                              <span>AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

                              <span>The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.
Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

HYPE is mirroring Solana’s 2021 breakout structure, targeting a 240% rally by July.

Familiar crypto fractals suggest HYPE could spark similar momentum-driven hype.

Hyperliquid&#x27;s native token, HYPE, is mirroring a strikingly similar price structure to Solana’s (SOL) early 2021 breakout — one that preceded a 300% rally.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.
