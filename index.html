                              <span>Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.
Whale accumulation supports bullish XRP view
Certain indicators show that XRP’s ongoing price rise may not be just a short-term reaction to the positive macroeconomic news.

Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

                              <span>Bitcoin holders are becoming more comfortable borrowing against their crypto as market confidence grows, according to Seamus Rocca, CEO of the Gibraltar-based private bank, Xapo Bank. 
In an interview at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca told Cointelegraph that with Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $95,000 and institutional adoption starting to catch on, the mood among investors has shifted from short-term speculation to a more long-term outlook. 
“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”

Still, BTC miner Hive Digital Technologies is doubling down on the untapped potential of the Latin American (LATAM) market.
In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Hive Digital Technologies’ president and CEO, Aydin Kilic, said that Paraguay presents a compelling long-term opportunity equipped with “geopolitical stability, low-cost hydro energy, and a government open to foreign investment”.

EIP-7702 allows externally owned accounts to act as smart contracts and cover gas expenses (transaction fees) and payments in tokens that are not Ether (ETH). EIP-7251 increases the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, which makes operations for large stakers easier and simpler.

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …</span>

The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

The integration means USDt (USDT) will now be supported across Line’s messenger-based Mini DApp ecosystem and self-custodial wallet, enabling users to interact with stablecoins inside an interface they already use daily, Tether said in a May 7 announcement.
Line users will be able to use USDt for in-app payments, cross-border transfers and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.
“Through LINE NEXT’s blockchain infrastructure, over 200 million LINE users will now have a straightforward way to engage with digital assets in everyday life,” Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said…</span>

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

                              <span>Trump family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is proposing to airdrop a small amount of its new US dollar-pegged stablecoin to reward early WLFI holders in a test of its airdrop mechanism. 
With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

                              <span>Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

                              <span>Members of the crypto community are circulating apparent “proof” that Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu faked his suicide as he promoted his new memecoin during a Pump.fun livestream on May 4.
The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun live stream.
The unverified letter from Yu to an early investor states that he deliberately created a livestream pretending to shoot himself as it was the only “viable exit” from persistent harassment, blackmail, threats and hate crimes.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. 
If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description.

Cet article n’a pas vocation à encenser PostgreSQL ni à dénigrer Oracle. Il s’agit de vous présenter les problèmes que nous avons rencontrés, comment nous les avons résolus et, pour certains, comment nous aurions pu les anticiper.
Notre client a décidé de migrer ses bases de données Oracle vers PostgreSQL et nous a sollicités pour réaliser cette migration. 
Pour comprendre une partie des problèmes rencontrés, il faut revenir sur l’histoire de SQL :
1970 : IBM créé SEQUEL, un langage permettant d’interroger et éditer une base de données relationnelles, il sera renommé par la suite SQL en 1975.

These concepts might initially sound intimidating, but they&#x27;re at the core of blockchain, ensuring data integrity, authenticity, and security. I learned about them through the &quot;Intro to Blockchain&quot; section of the Cardano Academy—a fantastic first stop on my learning journey. Here&#x27;s a breakdown of what I took away.
Hash functions are everywhere in a blockchain—they link blocks, verify data, and secure transactions. Think of a hash function as a digital fingerprint: it takes an input of any size and produces a fixed-length string (called a hash diges…</span>

If you’re like most car owners, your vehicle is often your second-largest investment after your home. But what if you could transform the daily grind of commuting into a lucrative opportunity? Enter the world of car advertising—an innovative approach where the odometer turns into a dial for dollars.
Car advertising is rapidly gaining traction as a dynamic marketing strategy. With over 276 million private vehicles on the road in the U.S. alone, businesses are recognizing the untapped potential of using these cars as mobile billboards. Adorned with vibrant wraps or decals, these moving advertisements can effortlessly reach audiences across diverse demographics.
The concept is simple:

We all know Docker revolutionized software development by introducing lightweight containers to build, ship, and run applications consistently across environments. But while Docker Engine is powerful, it’s Docker Desktop that truly bridges the gap between container technology and day-to-day developer productivity.

Web API conventions are basically set of rules that guides to build maintainable, scalable APIs and and provides consistency as well. 
Use of Http methods properly like GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
Then it comes to naming convention which tells us to use nouns not verbs such as /users , /invoices etc. 
One more thing in namming convention is that not to use action in the path for example /getUsers instead of it use method GET and keep name a noun like /users.
The third thing using appropriate status codes for corresponding status for example 200 for success and 400 for bad request and so on.
And at last use versioning e.g. /v1/users and consistent request and response formats i.e. JSON format.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Managing records in SQL and ensuring that you can retrieve the latest versions along with their effective dates can be a bit challenging, especially when your dataset contains multiple entries for the same identifier. In this article, we will explore how to achieve that by leveraging SQL queries, focusing on your requirement of showing the latest records as active with future effective dates.
Understanding the Challenge
Given your table, which holds multiple records for ex_ID with varying created_date and last_mod_date, the goal is to find the latest record for each ex_ID and mark it as active. The additional requirement is to set an effective date as a future date (e.g., &#x27;2099-12-31&#x27;) for the active record. Let&#x27;s break this down into manageable steps.

Nope, not yet, but hopefully I’m onto something.
A first few days of April had the regular content being published, with Jam challenges leading to the start and theme announcement.
[01.04] Gamedev.js: Breakout 71 — classic with a twist

[02.04] Gamedev.js: Jam 2025: V Shaders challenge

[03.04] Gamedev.js: CSScape Room — no-JavaScript escape game

[04.04] Gamedev.js: Jam 2025: Phaser challenge

[06.04] Gamedev.js: Pico-PubSub — the smallest PubSub library

[07.04] Gamedev.js: Jam 2025: $Noods challenge

[08.04] Gamedev.js: 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam

[09.04] Gamedev.js: Jam 2025: Open Source challenge

[10.04] Gamedev.js: NPC Friday #1: Vibe Coding intro

[11.04] Gamedev.js: All challenges in Gamedev.js Jam 2025: V Shaders, Open Source, Phaser, and $Noods

[13.04] Gamedev.js: Jam 2025 start and theme announcement!

[28.04] Gamedev.js: All the entries from Gamedev.js Jam 2025



Then I focused on the Jam entirely.
We’ve ended up with 22 entries submitted to the $NOODS challenge in Gamedev.js Jam 2025, which is pretty good.
Announcing last Gamedev.js Jam 2025 partners, prizes, and experts before the start, and then the theme announcement. Later on filtering out spam, and assisting with submissions, all while being active on social media.

Open Source (122 games)
Build it with Phaser (68 games)
$NOODS (22 games)
We ended up with 420 entries this year! Check out #gamedevjs for the stream of cool web game updates shared by the community.
I bought a drone, DJI Avata 2 to be exact, as I wanted an FPV one for half of my life actually - really happy with the first days of using it.
Announcing Gamedev.js Jam 2025 winners and hopefully vibe coding some entries into other game jams myself.</span>
