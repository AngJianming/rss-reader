The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV.
Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry.
“With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each.
ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows.

Search engines don’t watch your videos.
That’s where transcription becomes powerful: it turns spoken words into searchable content. Whether you&#x27;re an educator, podcaster, developer, or digital creator, here&#x27;s how to make your YouTube videos more discoverable using transcription—and how to do it the right way.
When you transcribe your videos, you&#x27;re essentially creating a rich text layer that:

Introduction


Working with databases often involves dealing with NULL values, which represent missing or undefined data. Whether you&#x27;re aggregating information, performing calculations, or generating reports, encountering NULLs can lead to confusing results or broken logic. Fortunately, SQL provides a powerful and simple function to manage these situations: SQL COALESCE. This article provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing COALESCE SQL to simplify the handling of NULL values in your queries.
The SQL COALESCE function is used to return the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions. It&#x27;s especially useful when dealing with columns that may contain NULLs and when you want to provide a fallback value.

? Why do some tags need a closing tag and others don’t? And what’s the deal with all the nesting?
The good news? You don’t have to figure it all out by yourself.
In this post, we’re breaking down the basics of HTML — what tags are, how they work, and how you can use AI to learn them faster (and fix them when things go wrong). Whether you’re new to coding or picking it up again after a break, this guide will help you get your footing in it.
We’re continuing our series inspired by the book HTML &amp; CSS Coding with AI — and today, we’re starting at the very beginning: how websites are structured.

Demos matter because, yes, someone actually cares what you built (and they expect it to work). This is your chance to show off your genius, justify that two week sprint, or at least avoid getting fired for the day.
“If it compiles on the first try, a nyawawa (demon) is probably involved.” Odhiambo. F 
Why Demos Matter (Even if You’d Rather Be Coding)
Show Your Masterpiece: A demo lets you share what you’ve built. Managers and coworkers finally see your code in action instead of trusting your rambling status updates and confluence edits. I know you already know that.

                              <span>Modal windows—those popups that overlay a page—are commonly used for login forms, alerts, and messages. Most developers reach for JavaScript when creating them. But what if I told you that you can build a clean, functional modal window using only HTML and CSS?
In this post, I’ll show you exactly how to do that—no JavaScript required.
There are times when I want something fast, lightweight, and easy to maintain—especially for simple sites, landing pages, or documentation. That’s when a pure CSS modal becomes the perfect solution. It works even when JavaScript is disabled and keeps your front end lean.

The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.
The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

                              <span>The Texas House of Representatives has passed the third reading of SB 21, a bill that seeks to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the state. The bill passed in a 101-42 vote and will now go to Texas Governor Greg Abbott to either sign into law or veto.
SB 21, authored by state Senator Charles Schwertner, establishes a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve that is managed by the state’s comptroller. The legislation allows the comptroller to invest in any cryptocurrency with a market cap above $500 billion over the previous 12-month period. Currently, the only cryptocurrency fitting the requirement is Bitcoin.

Bitcoin market cycle tops are notoriously hard to time, but combining technical and behavioral indicators can offer strong signals.

The MVRV-Z Score, Pi Cycle Top indicator, trade volume trends, Puell Multiple, and exchange inflows accurately predict Bitcoin price cycle tops.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
Since late 2024, Bitcoin whale accumulation has surged. Glassnode data shows that the number of addresses holding over 100 BTC has jumped by almost 14%, reaching 18,200 — a level not seen since 2017. The biggest market pl…</span>

In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024.

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether&#x27;s recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It&#x27;s a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

                              <span>Crypto cybersecurity firm Trugard and onchain trust protocol Webacy have developed an artificial intelligence-based system for detecting crypto wallet address poisoning.
According to a May 21 announcement shared with Cointelegraph, the new tool is part of Webacy’s crypto decisioning tools and “leverages a supervised machine learning model trained on live transaction data in conjunction with onchain analytics, feature engineering and behavioral context.” 
The new tool purportedly has a success score of 97%, tested across known attack cases. “Address poisoning is one of the most underreported yet costly scams in crypto, and it preys on the simplest assumption: That what you see is what you get,” said Webacy co-founder Maika Isogawa.
