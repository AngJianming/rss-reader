You can use this article as a cheat sheet or a starting point to mastering the CLI.
The CLI is one of the most essential tools in a software engineer&#x27;s toolbox. As useful as it is, it can feel a little intimidating for many developers (especially on the very first encounter). Others get excited. I remember seeing the terminal for the first time and thinking, &quot;whoa, that looks super cool, I want to master it. NOW!&quot;
But the CLI wasn&#x27;t built to impress or scare anyone (especially not scare). It was designed to make our lives easier by providing the simplest form of interface possible. As developers, we should always strive for simplicity—our job is already hard enough without adding layers of unnecessary complexity.
The CLI isn&#x27;t only about simplicity—it&#x27;s the universal tool. Y…</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re experiencing issues with your Android device not showing up in IntelliJ IDEA despite it being recognized via ADB and the command line, you&#x27;re not alone. This is a common issue among developers using Flutter with various IDEs, including IntelliJ. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons why your Android device might not be appearing in IntelliJ and provide step-by-step solutions to resolve the issue.
Understanding the Issue
The problem of an Android device not appearing in IntelliJ IDEA while being visible in the command line is often due to a configuration or compatibility issue within the IDE or the device&#x27;s connection settings. The fact that running flutter devices detects your device suggests that ADB is functioning correctly, and your device is connected. However, integ…</span>

                              <span>Many projects start out happily on Auth0’s free tier (up to ~7,000 MAUs), but the jump to the paid Basic plan—\$525/month for 7.5K active users—can sting fast. Beyond raw cost, teams worry about unpredictable bills, feature lock-ins, and vendor dependence.
Cloud-Provider Auth Services
AWS Cognito, Azure B2C, Google Identity Platform
Virtually free until very high volumes, but may lack out-of-the-box UI customization.
Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
Firebase Auth (free up to 50K users/month)
Supabase Auth
PocketBase (self-hosted)
SSOJet, Clerk.dev, Stytch, Kinde

All offer generous free tiers and modern SDKs
Self-Hosted Open-Source
Keycloak, Ory Kratos, Supertokens, Authgear
Full control and zero license fees, at the cost of hosting and maintenance overhead.
Build-Your-Own
Roll your own JWT-based login (e.g., using Passport.js or a simple email/password flow)
Simplest for very small scale but requires ongoing security diligence.
Scale &amp; Budget: Calculate total cost at your expected growth, not just free-tier limits.
Feature Requirements: Do you need MFA, SSO/SAML, social logins, or multi-tenant support?
Maintenance Overhead: Self-hosting shifts burden to your team; hosted solutions offload ops at a price.
Vendor Lock-In: Check data export and migration paths—some providers don’t let you export password hashes.
Community &amp; Support: A vibrant open-source community (Keycloak, Ory) or strong commercial SLAs (SSOJet, Clerk, Stytch) can save you headaches down the road.
By weighing cost, complexity, and required features, you can pick a path that fits both your technical needs and your wallet—whether that’s a serverless BaaS, a self-hosted IAM, or even a custom-built solution.

                              <span>This article will introduce how to import Excel data into MySQL quickly and easily.
Here, we prepare an Excel table, as shown below:

Open the DiLu Converter tool and  create a new database connection firstly. Here we select MySQL database. For a detailed introduction to creating a new database connection, please refer to: Create a new database connection guide


After creating a new database connection, click New Import

Select the Excel file to be imported and click Start.


As you can see, the table fields created by the default are all of the varchar type, which makes the import speed as fast as possible and avoids import failures caused by inconsistency between data and data types.
We can also let the tool automatically detect data types . The advantage of this is that the field type can be more consistent with the actual data and make subsequent SQL queries more convenient.
Select Rebuild Mode - Select Auto Detect, and click Start to re-import

See again

We can save the import configuration so that we can repeat the import next time.

You can see the saved import in the object interface or under the database connection on the left

Next time you open the software, first double-click the connection name to open the connection - double-click the import name to open the saved import.

Just click to start

                              <span>Solana stands out in the blockchain world for its blazing speed and throughput. But to truly unlock that power, developers need to rethink how they build smart contracts.
This guide breaks down how to write high-performance, scalable smart contracts tailored for Solana’s unique architecture.
Unlike Ethereum’s EVM model, Solana is account-based and parallelizable.
Programs (smart contracts) are stateless and immutable.
Accounts store the state, data, and are passed into programs explicitly.
The runtime can process many transactions simultaneously—if they don’t touch the same accounts.
➡️ Implication: Avoid account contention to benefit from true parallel execution.
Rust: The primary language for writing Solana programs. Offers performance, safety, and tight control.

                              <span>When working with modern C++ standards in MSVC, developers often encounter unexpected behavior when storing pointers to virtual methods in static inline variables, especially concerning issues with function calls and object lifetimes. In this article, we’ll dig into the reasons behind this behavior, particularly in the context of the provided code snippet, and explore solutions and best practices to avoid pitfalls.
Understanding the Issue
The issue arises from an ABI limitation related to how MSVC handles virtual methods stored in static inline variables. When you attempt to store a pointer to a virtual function in a static inline variable, MSVC incorrectly resolves the function pointer in some instances, subsequently leading to calls to the wrong function or, in some cases, even the destr…</span>

Shared Clipboard, which allows seamless copy-paste between the host and guest operating systems. However, this functionality is not enabled by default and requires proper configuration, including the installation of Guest Additions in the Ubuntu virtual machine. This guide walks you through the steps to enable clipboard sharing and eliminate the hassle of manual retyping.
A. Start Ubuntu in VirtualBox

B. Click on Devices then on Insert Guest Addition CD Image....

C. If prompted to run it, choose Run. You might need to enter your password.
If not prompted:
Open Terminal and run: 
sudo mkdir /media/cdrom
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

You might need to run them one after the other.
What does each command do?
sudo mkdir /media/cdrom
Creates a new directory called cdrom inside /media.
sudo is used to run the command with superuser (administrator) privileges.
sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom
Mounts the CD/DVD device (/dev/cdrom) to the /media/cdrom directory, making its contents accessible from that location.
sudo /media/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
Executes the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer from the mounted CD.
This typically improves integration between a VirtualBox guest OS and the host (e.g., better graphics support, shared clipboard, etc.).
In summary, these commands mount the VirtualBox Guest Additions CD and install the tools inside a Linux virtual machine.
C. Reboot Ubuntu VM
sudo reboot
Furthermore, Enable Shared Clipboard in VirtualBox Settings.
On the Virtualbox start up page, click on setting, then Advanced and under Shared Clipboard, click on Bidirectional.

(Optional) Set Drag and Drop to Bidirectional.
Test Copy and Paste
Try copying text from Windows and pasting into Ubuntu (e.g., in Terminal or a text editor).
Also try copying from Ubuntu to Windows.
Copy from window;

Paste in Linux terminal;</span>

Let&#x27;s talk about AI helping you with coding a website first. We all know it takes a lot of time and effort to build a site through coding. But now, you can just use ChatGPT and ask it to code for you. You can also leverage other AI-powered solutions to code faster if you don&#x27;t want AI to code for you from start to finish.
set up a database for your site. They can help you design the database, migrate data, and manage information with ease. It&#x27;s like having an expert database administrator by your side.
You can&#x27;t just code for a website and call it a day. You need to ensure its findability. Even a fantastic site won&#x27;t get you any results if people can&#x27;t find it on Google…</span>

                              <span>Global foreign exchange and payments platforms are lobbying hard against stablecoins, which stand to significantly disrupt their business models, investor Kevin O’Leary said during a keynote address at Consensus 2025. 
Legacy forex and payments platforms often extract large fees for servicing cross-border cash transfers and stand to lose out on revenue if regulated stablecoins become accepted as a cheaper, faster alternative, O’Leary said at the Toronto conference. 
“Currency trading is a multi-trillion dollar market — and it’s old and ugly and inefficient,” O’Leary said, adding that “[ t]he biggest threat to that monopoly or oligopoly is a regulated stablecoin.” 
“Once that’s approved, the multi-trillion dollar FX market becomes efficient, transparent, and inexpensive,” he said.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in Toronto on May 15, Grewal said there had been “hiccups” in Congress since the Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, in March. Though Grewal said there were disputes over “substantial issues that need to be addressed” in the bill, he hinted that Trump’s involvement in the industry was a “complicating factor.”

Bitcoin’s struggles to overtake the $105,000 level as US macroeconomic headwinds remain a challenge.  

Steady inflows from institutional investors and the strength of the $100,000 support point to growing confidence in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled to break above $105,000 since May 10, leading traders to question whether the bullish momentum has faded. Although BTC managed to reclaim the $104,000 level, demand for leveraged long positions has dropped sharply, as indicated by the decline in the Bitcoin futures premium.

&quot;I think that there are two sides to this equation. One is the asset, and the other one is the payment. So, you need more high-quality assets onchain, but you also need more frictionless payments that existing institutions can use easily,&quot; Nazarov said on May 14.

                              <span>Bitdeer Technologies Group reported a 41% year-over-year drop in revenue to $70.1 million for the first quarter of 2025, the Bitcoin miner said on May 15. 
The Singaporean company clocked an operating loss of $3.2 million for the quarter, down from a $34.1 million profit during the same period last year, its earnings release said. 
However, Bitdeer reported a Q1 net income of more than $400 million, largely driven by gains on convertible notes and warrants issued to stablecoin issuer Tether in 2024.
Bitdeer’s revenue declines come as miners increasingly expand beyond Bitcoin (BTC) mining and pivot toward supplying high-performance computing (HPC) for artificial intelligence applications.

                              <span>More than two-and-a-half years after filing for bankruptcy, cryptocurrency exchange FTX is moving forward with repaying users who have not had access to their funds.
In a May 15 notice, the FTX Recovery Trust announced that it would begin disbursing funds to the second group of parties eligible under the exchange’s reorganization plan. Starting on May 30, FTX will send more than $5 billion to creditors “within 1 to 3 business days” through crypto firms BitGo and Kraken. 
In accordance with the reorganization plan, FTX said five groups of “convenience classes” would receive between 54% and 120% distribution of assets. The repayment schedule for the next class of creditors will be “announced in due course,” and the debtors were expected to pay up to $16 billion if all claims were filed.

In an interview with Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025 in Toronto, Pampati said that “the whole world outside of the United States […] has already jumped onto this [stablecoins],” adding that “the US is [...] at the doorstep.” 
“I really think about new use cases that can emerge because of the borderless nature of stablecoins, because of the efficiency of the dollar onchain,” he said. “If you&#x27;re trying to send money to your friend in Nigeria, why do you have to go through a bunch of hoops?”

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana formed a megaphone chart pattern with a potential $210 price target. 

Solana’s ecosystem growth highlights renewed investor interest with a $4 billion realized cap increase and 731 million transactions.

Solana (SOL) price tested its key resistance at $180 earlier this week, but the altcoin failed to establish a position above the level. Over the past few days, SOL has consolidated above the $170 mark, but prices have dropped 5.65% since May 14.
Including the recent minor dip, Solana has formed a megaphone pattern on the 4-hour chart, a classic technical setup indicating increasing volatility.

Bid-side liquidity is staking up on the downside near $93,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has rebounded by 36% from its April 9, five-month low at $74,500. However, its failure to decisively break above $106,000 has sparked concerns about whether a sharp correction is possible in the coming days.

                              <span>The slow adoption of stablecoins in Canada has some local crypto industry observers concerned that the country is falling behind.
The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) classified stablecoins as “securities and/or derivatives” in December 2022 after the FTX debacle that shook markets and turned many lawmakers against the crypto industry.
Regulating stablecoins as a security has seen few local stablecoin issuers arise, but in the United States and the European Union, softening regulations have seen significant growth in the stablecoin market. This makes Canada, observers say, less competitive with other jurisdictions. 
Of particular concern is the perceived gap in peer-to-peer (P2P) payments in Canada, which stablecoins are uniquely qualified to fill.

According to a May 15 Fortune interview, Coinbase&#x27;s chief security officer, Philip Martin, said the company flagged customer support contractors who allowed scammers access to user data, suggesting they could be Indian nationals. The CSO’s comments came after some crypto users reeled from attempted phishing attacks using their Coinbase data, which the exchange estimated could cost them between $180 million and $400 million in remediation and reimbursement.

While strong ETF inflows often drive Bitcoin rallies, recent data shows price movements can occur independently.

Despite short-term selling pressure, long-term BTC whale buying suggests a potential continuation of the BTC uptrend.

The Bitcoin (BTC) market posted a 90+% drop in spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, falling from $3 billion in the last week of April to just $228 million this week.
Historically, a slowdown in ETF inflows has impacted BTC price, notably when daily inflows averaged over $1.5 billion for consecutive weeks. To understand the potential impact on Bitcoin, let’s examine four key periods of significant spot ETF activity and their correlation with BTC pri…</span>

The puppet show is ending.
The Brookings Institution found that generative artificial intelligence may disrupt at least 50% of tasks performed by more than 30% of all workers. The same study also estimates that genAI may affect at least 10% of tasks performed by approximately 85% of the human workforce. The TL;DR from these stats? AI’s effects are likely to be both broad and deep.
If AI doesn’t already scare you, self-learning AI agents that autonomously achieve goals may fix that. Forget your sanitized ChatGPT conversations and bland AI assistants. Superior agents are AI that autonomously achieve human-set objectives by any means necessary. While OpenAI’s valuation of $300 billion benefits the few rather than the ma…</span>

The 10-year Treasury yield is the interest rate that the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years.
When the government needs cash, it issues bonds called Treasury notes, and the 10-year note is one of the most watched. The “yield” is the annual return you’d get if you bought that bond and held it until it matures. It’s expressed as a percentage, like 4% or 5%.
Think of it as the government saying, “Hey, lend me $1,000, and I’ll pay you back in 10 years with some interest.” That interest rate and the yield move up or down based on demand for the bonds, inflation expectations and the overall economy. Because US Treasurys are considered safe (the government isn’t likely to def…</span>

Wintermute announced the opening of its New York office on May 15, citing improved regulatory conditions in the world’s largest economy.
“As the US takes a friendlier stance on digital assets and institutional adoption accelerates, we moved quickly to establish roots in New York City,” the company wrote in a May 15 X post, adding that the local presence will help them in “contributing to the future regulatory framework.”

A lag in Tether’s wallet blacklisting process allowed over $78 million in illicit funds to be moved before enforcement actions took effect, according to a new report from blockchain compliance company AMLBot.  
Tether’s address blacklisting becomes effective only after a considerable delay from when the process is initiated on Ethereum and Tron, according the report published May 15.
“This delay originates from Tether’s multisignature contract setup on both Tron and Ethereum, transforming what should be an immediate compliance action into a window of opportunity for illicit actors,“ the report reads.

This forced miners to rethink their operations, optimize efficiency, cut energy costs and upgrade hardware to remain profitable. Cointelegraph Research, with insights from industry experts at Uminers, examines this transformation in its latest report. The analysis covers ASIC efficiency improvements, corporate performance, geographical expansion and new revenue models. As miners adapt, Bitcoin moves into a new era where institutional momentum and sovereign adoption could redefine its role in the global financial system.

On May 15, blockchain data showed that Tether’s treasury minted $1 billion of its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDt (USDT), into the Tron network. 
As of May 14, Tether’s stablecoin transparency page shows that Tron’s authorized USDT totals $73.7 billion, while Ethereum has $74.5 billion in authorized USDT tokens. If the newly minted tokens are added to the number of authorized USDT assets, Tron’s supply surpasses Ethereum’s. 
In terms of circulating supply, Tron also has the lead with $73.6 billion USDT on the network, while Ethereum only has $71.8 billion.

On this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson sit down with Isabel Foxen Duke, general partner at Unbroken Chain and longtime Bitcoin advocate, to unpack what she calls “Bitcoin Season 2.”

Bitcoin beyond money
“Bitcoin Season 2 is really about seeing what we can do with Bitcoin outside of just being money,” said Duke. 
“What are the broad range of financial use cases for [Bitcoin] other than just being money by itself?”
New developments like ordinals, runes, and decentralized financial (DeFi) tools are pushing Bitcoin beyond its traditional identity as a digital store of value.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price is retracing, but strong ETF inflows, high network activity and whale accumulation suggest BTC is on track to $140,000.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.9 billion in net inflows in two weeks, mirroring past rallies.

Declining exchange balances and a rising transaction volume Z-score suggest increasing overall demand.

Bitcoin (BTC) price was down 1.4% over the last 24 hours. It traded 6% below its all-time high of $109,000, reached on Jan. 20. Nevertheless, several fundamental, onchain and technical metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s upside is not over.

US Treasurys and foreign capital “repatriation” make a recipe for $1 million BTC, says Arthur Hayes.

Europeans face tightening capital controls, inviting a recommendation to take back control of personal funds.

Seven-figure BTC price targets are already gaining traction.

Bitcoin (BTC) will shoot to $1 million in just three years, thanks to global macroeconomic shifts, Arthur Hayes forecasts.
In his latest blog post released on May 15, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX doubled down on his sky-high BTC price prediction.
