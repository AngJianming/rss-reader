                              <span>At the end of 2024, I embarked on the Cloud Resume Challenge, a hands-on project that transformed my understanding of cloud computing and security. I have a background in video production and strategic communication but, was eager to pivot into cloud security. It&#x27;s been a dream of mine for a long time to learn about and eventually work in IT. The challenge, created by Forrest Brazeal, pushed me to build a serverless resume website on AWS, automate its deployment, and implement advanced security measures. The result? A fully functional, secure website at trisoncloudresume.com and a portfolio that showcases my skills in AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD. Here’s a breakdown of my journey, the skills I gained, and the security mods that make this project stand out.

                              <span>I’m no DevOps by trade. I’m SWE, dad, and tired. I’m building a thing now. DevOps kind of thing. You might love it. Or maybe you won’t care. That’s fine.
This is a “why” post. A “You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation” post. Some light weekend reading, I guess. So...
I bought an external camera. For security. Also for tinkering. It came with a Chinese cloud UI and a shady app. No way Xi is watching my backyard - it’s too messy. I’m too embarrassed to stream that to all of China.
Quick googling showed the stream was available locally. And something called Frigate could help - an open-source NVR with AI detection. Cool! Half a day playing Anna and Elsa with one hand and setting up Docker with the other - and I had the stream going to Frigate.

Great success 👍👍

This will focus more on coding and hands-on implementation rather than theoretical knowledge as it&#x27;s already available abundantly.
A2A is primarily for agent-to-agent communication and coordination, while MCP is focused on agent-to-tool integration. In other words, &quot;A2A enables agents to talk to each other; MCP lets agents trigger tools.&quot; For a detailed comparison including schema differences, read more here: MCP vs A2A: Similarities and Differences

In today&#x27;s digital landscape, web application security is more critical than ever. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains one of the most prevalent security vulnerabilities according to OWASP Top 10, affecting countless websites and applications. Yet, the process of identifying these vulnerabilities can be time-consuming and complex, requiring multiple tools and manual correlation.
Enter RedTiger – an all-in-one automated XSS vulnerability testing tool designed to streamline security assessments with intelligent endpoint filtering and an elegant terminal UI. As a cybersecurity professional, I developed RedTiger to address the challenges of efficient XSS testing at scale.

  🎯 The Challenge


I had been searching for two songs for decades. One was a dreamy eurobeat track, the other a dance cover with a female vocal.

I had no artist, no title, no recording — only a feeling, a rough memory of the beat, and the fact that I heard each one only once on the radio in Belgrade in the early ’90s.
Instead of asking “What song is this?”, I approached ChatGPT like a research assistant.
Here’s what I gave it:
Vocal style: Female


Era clues: One was from the late ’80s/early ’90s, the other from the mid-’90s


Beat style: One had a groove similar to Back to Life by Soul II Soul; the other leaned more toward eurobeat


Context: Both songs were aired only once on Belgrad…</span>

                              <span>This is a submission for Frontend Challenge - June Celebrations, CSS Art: June Celebrations.
In Brazil, June is marked by “Festa Junina,” a vibrant celebration filled with colors, traditional foods, lively music, and lots of joy. So, I decided to create a Festa Junina scene entirely in CSS, taking this opportunity to share a bit of Brazilian culture with the global community.
🎉 https://festa-junina-2025.jamesrmoro.me

Since 2019, I’ve made a habit of creating Christmas scenes using only HTML and CSS, documenting the entire process year after year in this playlist.
I always wondered where I could share these creations more broadly—so I was thrilled to see that this month’s Frontend Challenge theme is “celebration.” I decided to bring Festa Junina to the challenge and share a bit of this tradition.
For this Festa Junina scene, I added:
A fixed side menu with information about Festa Junina.
Clickable stalls:
Food: Discover the main traditional dishes with images.
Games: See the most classic Festa Junina games.
Correio Elegante: traditional messages from the celebration.
Floating accordion: click to hear a typical tune that brings Festa Junina to life.</span>

Employee productivity remained consistent among remote and hybrid workers at 90%, yet many professionals still struggle to maintain peak performance while working from home. 26% of U.S. households now have at least one person working remotely a minimum of one day per week, making remote work productivity strategies more crucial than ever.

                              <span>Back in the 1960s, when computers were still a relatively new frontier, the term &quot;software engineering&quot; was first coined. The folks developing these early digital systems looked to a well-established field for guidance: civil engineering. They imagined building software much like constructing a bridge or a skyscraper, applying rigorous principles of design, analysis, and construction. This initial comparison profoundly shaped how we first approached creating software.

It made sense, then, that the waterfall model became the go-to approach. Think of it like a meticulous building project: you gather all the requirements, then design, then build, then test, and finally, deploy. Each phase had to be perfectly completed before moving on to the next. This rigid, step-by-step process mirrored th…</span>

                              <span>A key aspect of software development is code sharing—not just utility functions, but also business-critical logic like authentication flows, payment integrations, and domain-specific models. Monorepos help formalize this practice by turning shared code from a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; into a scalable architecture.
In this article, I’ll walk through how to build a production-ready Flutter monorepo that:
Shares UI components and business logic
Maintains consistent dependencies across apps and packages
Streamlines testing and deployment through unified workflows
You&#x27;re building multiple apps (e.g., customer and admin apps)
Your team maintains shared packages used across different products
You need atomic updates, such as rolling out a security patch across all apps simultaneously

Managing inbound emails efficiently is a common challenge, especially when working with Postmark&#x27;s Inbound API. Parsing raw JSON responses can quickly become overwhelming, leading to unnecessary complexity. To tackle this, I built postmark-models—a lightweight library designed to structure and validate Postmark inbound messages using Pydantic models.
With postmark-models, developers can seamlessly extract relevant email data, enforce schema validation, and minimize manual parsing efforts, making Postmark integration much more manageable.
Since this is a library, the best way to test it is through code. Here&#x27;s a simple demonstration:
$ poetry add postmark-models # pip install postmark-models

from postmark_models import MessageInbound, example_message
