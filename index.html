Asynchronous programming in JavaScript has revolutionized how developers build applications, allowing for non-blocking execution and a smoother user experience. However, even as there is significant traction with Promises, Async/Await, and the Event Loop, there exists an advanced and often lesser-known technology that pushes the boundaries of asynchronous programming: Fibers. This article dives deep into Fibers, covering their historical and technical context, detailed code examples, edge cases, comparisons with alternative approaches, real-world uses, performance considerations, and advanced debugging techniques. 
JavaScript was initially designed to be a synchronous language. The introduction of the Event Loop, callbacks, and …</span>

                              <span>This article was inspired by Anthony Max discussing replacing HTMX with a new module called HMPL.js. From a QA Engineer’s POV, there are many important lessons to be learned from this approach
What is HTMX and HMPL.js?
HMPL.js is a modern alternative. It uses a fetch API based approach and pure JavaScript to handle requests and responses, as well as templating using {{ … }} placeholders.
And, after reading the article by Anthony Max, I started to see the approach in a different light — especially as a QA Engineer. There are a lot of interesting things that come up, both in terms of technical challenges and quality improvement opportunities, that are worth discussing briefly but deep!
Opportunities For QA Engineer
More Control Over Testing, HMPL uses fetch explicitly, so QA can easily:

                              <span>When AWS Amplify debuted in 2017, even “just adding a login page” meant wrestling with CloudFormation templates and IAM policies. Eight years of steady releases have chipped away at those manual chores and debugging marathons. Today you can spin up a prototype on par with well-known SaaS products—often in a single weekend—using Amplify alone.

This post walks through that journey, highlighting what each release simplified and which kinds of products suddenly became feasible. Use it as a retrospective or as a compass for planning your own adoption.

We&#x27;ll walk through a structured approach and implement it step by step in C++, JavaScript, and Python. Let’s go! 🚀
You’re given a string s containing lowercase letters and asterisks *.
You must repeatedly perform this operation until no * is left:
Remove the leftmost *.
Remove the smallest non-* character to its left. If there are multiple smallest characters, you can choose any.
📝 Goal: Return the lexicographically smallest string after all * and their associated characters have been deleted.
This problem is all about greedy decision-making. At every step, you must:
Process characters left to right.
For every *, find the smal…</span>

From the sleek layout to the interactive features, they are the artists and engineers of the web world. But what exactly does a front-end developer do? And why is this role so crucial in today’s digital-first world?
Let’s dive in—not with boring definitions, but with a story.
Imagine you’re planning a vacation. You go to a travel website, and within seconds, you’re welcomed by beautiful visuals, interactive maps, smooth scrolling, and a booking button that just works. Behind all that smooth magic is a front-end developer—someone who brings design to life, making your online journey seamless, intuitive, and enjoyable.

Ah, Python. The language that whispers sweet promises of clean code, elegant syntax, and—if you&#x27;re lucky—less soul-crushing debugging. Like adopting a pet snake. It&#x27;s charming, deceptively low maintenance, and suddenly it&#x27;s wrapped around every part of your life.
Let me take you on a rollercoaster ride through my Python journey. Buckle up—it’s about to get snekky.
I still remember our first encounter. I typed:
print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

And Python replied, almost seductively:

Hello, world!
That’s it. No semicolons. No curly braces. Just vibes.
Compared to my ex—cough Java cough—Python was like meeting someone who understood me without making me constantly explain myself. I was smitten. It was all so readable. So fri…</span>

By the end of this chapter, your portfolio will be fully polished, ready to showcase and deploy.
Enhance your project section by integrating representative images that showcase your work clearly. Put your images in the assets folder it helps keeping the directory cleam. The image may be the screenshot of your frontend application or snapshot of your terminal output. Though, it is not a must have but a good to have feature in the portfolio.
