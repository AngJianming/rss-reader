Don’t do Project without Product!!
In our ever changing world you are better off being results-oriented and methodical.
Whether you are working on a software, or a hardware, or a service or perhaps a combination of ALL three. Do not do one (Product or Project) and neglect the other! Do not leave out Product because of Project and vice versa. Be careful out there. Do your Project with Product. Do your Product with Project. One is NOT superior to the other. They both have their purpose individually.
Many newbies have never heard of the term Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) and it’s very sad for them. Many of these same newbies have never heard of or understood how SPM (Software Project Management) was meant to aid SE (Software Engineering).
Rather than trying to pit Product against Project or Project against Product, I am here to tell you that both can work hand-in-hand to achieve a successful solution to a problem.
Take my guidance, I have been here for quite some years now.
Learn to pick (and combine) aspects that is useful to you and works perfectly to your cause. If it works and is useful, go ahead and apply it. If it weighs you down, drop it. Your end goal is to arrive at a solution to an actual/existing problem!
Doing Product Management with Project Management (and vice versa) allows to be results-oriented and methodical.

However, as environments get more complex, manual setup becomes a bottleneck, and that’s where Infrastructure as Code (IaC) shines.
So What Exactly is IaC?
Whether using Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi, or Ansible, IaC empowers DevOps teams to move fast without breaking things (too often).
Why Should You Care?
Zero Drift Between Environments


Rollbacks Like a Pro


Speed + Scale


Collaboration That Doesn’t Break Things



The Bigger Picture
It supports:
Immutable infrastructure
Automated testing and deployment
Disaster recovery through reproducibility
Compliance-as-code
In short, it turns infrastructure from an art… into an engineering discipline.

When hosting a post content majority of hosting platforms provide the top header image section that acts as a hook to associate blog&#x27;s content with some visualization and this is actually the first big thing that audience will see.
For content creators there are many libraries with free images like pexel, also there non-free subscription based photos/images catalogues. Often you spend some time to select an image that is more accurate to blog post content.
But, such platforms perform images search only based on single tag input - so you can not fully search/describe the image that you are interested in.
Having access to AWS Nova and looking at its latest features I got the idea that such images search (actually generation) based on post content can be automated using AWS Nova Ca…</span>

                              <span>Welcome back, terminal traveler! You’ve figured out where you are in the Linux file system, and now it’s time to do something exciting:
Create stuff. Break stuff. Clean it up like nothing ever happened.
Today, we’re diving into the beginner-friendly basics of file manipulation — because knowing how to read, write, and obliterate files is essential in your Linux journey (and just feels kinda powerful).
Let’s get into it.

Want to create a file out of thin air like a command-line wizard?

Boom. You’ve just summoned an empty file named pizza.txt. It won’t have any pineapple on it (thankfully!), but it exists.

                              <span>I recently launched RepsRise.app — a minimal app to track calisthenics workouts (pushups, pullups, dips, etc.). I built it because I kept forgetting how many reps I did and had no idea if I was actually progressing.

Right now it&#x27;s still an MVP, but it works. I kept the tech simple to move fast:
HTML + JS — just enough to build what I need


TailwindCSS — for quick styling without thinking too hard


DaisyUI — great for fast UI components that don’t look like garbage


localStorage — to persist workouts for now (may switch to Firebase later)
The goal was to ship something useful fast. I do what I call &quot;vibe coding&quot; — no strict plan, just building in flow.

I’ve also been using Cursor AI as my editor lately, which actually fits that style. It doesn’t overtake the process, just helps me move faster when I get stuck or bored.
It’s not perfect, but it’s live, and it’s already helping me stay consistent with training. If you&#x27;re into calisthenics or like seeing small web apps, feel free to check it out:

Would love thoughts, feedback, or ideas if you’ve built something similar!</span>

                              <span>Introduction
In this article, we&#x27;ll address a common challenge for developers integrating Pardot tracking with their ASP.NET web applications. Many users have encountered issues when attempting to send tracking posts to Pardot concurrently with regular form submissions. Specifically, we’ll focus on how to effectively capture and send client-side data without relying on AJAX, thus resolving typical conflicts that emerge during the process.
Why Is There a Challenge?
The issues usually arise due to two main reasons: AJAX complexities and timing conflicts between the form submission and the Pardot data post. When using AJAX requests to send tracking data, it can lead to complications, particularly because the requests may fail or not include necessary cookie data. Additionally, implementing se…</span>

Concurrency in JavaScript is a nuanced topic that has evolved significantly with the rise of web technologies and the demand for more responsive applications. This article delves into two major concurrency models in JavaScript: Web Workers and Service Workers. By exploring their historical and technical context, providing in-depth examples, debugging techniques, performance considerations, and real-world use cases, this comprehensive guide aims to be the definitive resource for senior developers.
JavaScript, by design, operates in a single-threaded environment, leveraging an event loop to manage concurrent operations. This architectural choice simplifies programming—avoiding the common pitfalls of multi-threaded environments …</span>

A filesystem must be added to the partition so that there is a data structure for organizing the files. Then it must be mounted to a directory within the file system hierarchy.
For brevity, I will mount just one of the partitions from the sdc drive. Let&#x27;s review what we&#x27;re working with.

                              <span>Crypto founders are heading to Washington, DC, to meet with lawmakers ahead of another expected vote on a stablecoin bill that initially failed in the Senate, according to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. 
In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. 
The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.
“Like any good negotiation, there’s a lot of details to work out at the last minute, but we’ve been stressing the urgency of this,” said Armstrong.
Many Democratic lawmakers have said they will not support any crypto-related legislation without a specific carve-out for President Donald Trump profiting from his digital asset ventures, like his TRUMP memecoin and his family-backed company World Liberty Financial. 
Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication.

Bitcoin remains above $100,000, but buyers are struggling to sustain prices above $105,000.

Strong altcoin performances suggest an altseason has started.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $103,000, with buyers attempting to drive the price to the all-time high of $109,588. Research firm Santiment said in a post on X that Bitcoin whales and sharks, holding 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin, accumulated 83,105 Bitcoin in the past 30 days, suggesting that “it may be a matter of time” before Bitcoin&#x27;s all-time high is taken out.
Along with Bitcoin, analysts are also gradually turning positive on altcoins. A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.

Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. 
From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.
Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.
1. Jeffy Yu faked his death, then his crypto pumped

Bitcoin’s realized cap has grown by $30 billion since April 20, reflecting steady investor confidence and new capital inflows.

A Bitcoin price consolidation pattern forecasts a potential 10% breakout by next week.

Bitcoin (BTC) continues to show strong bullish momentum as fresh capital inflows signal potential new price highs in the coming week. In an X post, Glassnode reported that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, which measures the total value of BTC based on the price at which each coin last moved, grew by $30 billion since April 20, growing at a 3% monthly rate in May. The current realized cap is $900 billion.

Rasul made the remarks during a panel on May 13 at the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto, pointing to Europe&#x27;s crypto regulatory framework as a model for Canada to consider:
“I’m sure the regulators are wondering if this was the right choice to approach stablecoins as a security. […] I would just say, look at MiCA, look at the way they’re approaching stablecoins. It’s a payment instrument. It should be regulated as such.”

Summer Mersinger, one of four commissioners currently serving at the US financial regulatory body Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will become the next CEO of the digital asset advocacy group the Blockchain Association (BA). 
In a May 14 notice, the Blockchain Association said its current CEO, Kristin Smith, would step down for Mersinger on May 16, allowing an interim head of the group to work until the CFTC commissioner assumes the role on June 2. Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the BA said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.

Despite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. 
Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. 
Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. 
The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private …</span>

                              <span>The French interior minister reportedly plans to meet cryptocurrency professionals in the aftermath of a violent kidnapping attempt on the family of a crypto exchange executive in Paris.
According to a May 14 France24 report, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has invited crypto professionals to meet him after a brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.
”I will assemble businesspeople working in cryptocurrencies, and we have a few of those in France, at the interior ministry to work with them on their security,” Retailleau reportedly told the Europe 1/CNews broadcaster.
On May 13, three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter while she was walking in Paris’ 11th district with a man and her son. The attackers…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Fake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.

Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.

The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.

The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.
Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam.

                              <span>Kazakhstan has the potential to become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia if regulatory restrictions are eased, according to Kanysh Tuleushin, the country’s first vice minister of digital development, innovation and aerospace industry.
In a recent op-ed for the Kazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper, Tuleushin said digital mining and smart policy shifts could position Kazakhstan as a regional leader in blockchain innovation.
“If all restrictions were lifted and digital asset trading was allowed across Kazakhstan, the impact could be significant,” he wrote.  
“Kazakhstan might become Central Asia’s crypto hub,” Tuleushin added, suggesting that broader legalization and taxation could add hundreds of billions of the country’s tenge currency to the national budget.

“Gold is getting very popular,” Amy Lo, the Swiss bank’s co-head of wealth management for Asia, said during Bloomberg’s New Voices event held in Hong Kong on May 13.
She cited rising geopolitical uncertainty and persistent market volatility as primary factors behind the shift. Investors, traditionally concentrated in US-centric assets, are now seeking broader exposure across alternative asset classes, including crypto, commodities and other currencies.

Bitcoin miners have stopped selling their BTC in what may signal the end of a lengthy distribution streak.

Hash Ribbons data shows good times continuing for both miners and BTC price strength.

Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation by miners is back as network participants swap selling for hodling at $75,000 lows.
Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that miners are now actively adding to their BTC reserves.

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. 
But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.

                              <span>Crypto venture capital deals in the first quarter of 2025 saw deal values jump even as the number of deals sank from the same quarter a year ago, says PitchBook.
The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.
However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.
PitchBook&#x27;s senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.
This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, Ge…</span>

                              <span>Two former executives of the bankrupt crypto lending service Cred have pleaded guilty to wire fraud connected to the company’s collapse.
Former Cred CEO Daniel Schatt and chief financial officer Joseph Podulka admitted to wire fraud as part of a plea deal with prosecutors, according to a May 13 text filing in a California District Court.
District Judge William Alsup accepted the plea deals and set a sentencing hearing for Aug. 26. Wire fraud can carry up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for individuals and $500,00 for businesses.
After accepting the defendant&#x27;s guilty plea, Judge William Alsup set a sentencing hearing for August. Source: PACER
