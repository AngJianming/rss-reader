                              <span>Introduction
If you&#x27;re delving into zero-knowledge proofs using Next.js and you&#x27;ve stumbled upon an issue generating zk-proofs, you’re not alone. Many developers encounter challenges when attempting to create zk-proofs with tools like snarkjs. This guide explores a common problem regarding input discrepancies that lead to proof generation failures even when everything seems correct. We&#x27;ll dive deep into why this might be happening and how to effectively address it.
Understanding ZK-Proofs and snarkjs


Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow one party to prove to another that they know a value without revealing the value itself. The snarkjs library is a popular choice for handling zk-proof generation in JavaScript. It is based on efficient cryptographic schemes, enabling developers to solve com…</span>

                              <span>Let’s be honest: most cloud “strategies” I come across aren’t really strategies — they’re glorified lift-and-shifts.
On paper, migrating to the cloud promises flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. But in reality? Many organizations just copy their on-prem setup into AWS, Azure, or GCP — and call it done.
As someone who’s spent years helping companies build scalable, secure, and cloud-native infrastructure across multi-cloud environments, I’ve seen this mistake over and over. But one project in particular made this painfully clear.
The Lift-and-Shift That Didn’t Shift Anything
But what I found was this:
configured almost exactly like their legacy setup.
2.They managed access using manually configured Security Groups and Network ACLs — trying to mimic their old firewall rules.

As SQL developers and data engineers, we often prioritize functionality and overlook query quality. But poor SQL habits can lead to:
Long response times
Bottlenecked applications
Excessive I/O and CPU
Poor scalability
In this post, we’ll break down 10 critical SQL anti-patterns and how to fix them.
Problem: Querying in a loop for each record.
-- BAD: Fetching orders per customer inside loop
SELECT * FROM Customers;
-- For each customer:
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE customer_id &#x3D; ?;

✅ Fix: Join and aggregate in one query
SELECT c.id, c.name, COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON o.customer_id &#x3D; c.id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;

Problem: Leading wildcard disables index usage.

                              <span>Finding common items between two generic lists in C# can be a common requirement in many applications, particularly when you want to understand overlaps in datasets. Using the example provided, we will discover how to efficiently identify shared elements between two lists of strings:
Understanding the Problem
In this scenario, we have two generic lists:
List TestList1 &#x3D; new List();
List TestList2 &#x3D; new List();
TestList1.Add(&quot;1&quot;);
TestList1.Add(&quot;2&quot;);
TestList1.Add(&quot;3&quot;);
TestList2.Add(&quot;3&quot;);
TestList2.Add(&quot;4&quot;);
TestList2.Add(&quot;5&quot;);

Our goal is to find the common elements in TestList1 and TestList2, which, in this case, should return &quot;3&quot;.

Ethereum uses Solidity, while Solana uses Rust.
So… what’s the difference? And why does it matter? Let’s break it down in plain English.
Think of Solidity and Rust like languages people use to build apps — just like websites are built with HTML or JavaScript.
Solidity was created specifically for blockchains — especially Ethereum. It’s simple, beginner-friendly, and looks a bit like JavaScript.
Rust is more like the serious, high-performance cousin. It’s used to build powerful software like games, browsers, and now — Solana.
One of the biggest problems in crypto? Bugs and hacks.

Observers in Laravel are used to listen for specific events on Eloquent models, such as creating, updating, and deleting records. The main advantage of using them is the ability to delegate the data handling logic to a dedicated class, keeping controllers and models leaner.
Imagine you need to perform an action every time a user is created. Instead of writing that logic directly in the controller or the model, you can use an Observer to ensure that the logic is isolated and easier to test.
Creating an Observer in Laravel is very simple. Let&#x27;s take a look at a basic example of an Observer for a User model:
php artisan make:observer UserObserver --model&#x3D;User

Open the App\Providers\EventServiceProvider file and register the observer:

In an X post, Aave said it topped $40.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) on May 12. Onchain data reveals that Aave v3, the latest version of the protocol, has approximately $40 billion in TVL. 
Aave is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users borrow cryptocurrency by depositing other types of cryptocurrency as collateral. Meanwhile, lenders earn yield from borrowers. 
“With these milestones, Aave is proving its dominance in the Lending Space,” DeFi analyst Jonaso said in a May 12 X post. TVL represents the total value of cryptocurrency deposited into a protocol’s smart contracts.

Bitcoin exhibits a bearish breakout from an ascending channel, with the risk of profit-taking near $106,000.

A lower-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) print could boost Bitcoin, but a higher CPI may increase bearish pressure, leading to a price drop below $100,000. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price reached an intraday high of $105,800 on May 12 but posted a 3% dip to $101,400 during the New York trading session. On the lower-time frame (LTF) chart, BTC oscillated between an ascending channel pattern before exhibiting a bearish breakout below the bottom range of the pattern.

During his keynote address at the Commission’s May 12 roundtable on tokenization and digital assets, Atkins welcomed “a new day at the SEC,” adding that “policymaking will no longer result from ad hoc enforcement actions. Instead, the Commission will utilize its existing rulemaking, interpretive, and exemptive authorities to set fit-for-purpose standards for market participants.”

Bitcoin price saw profit booking near $105,819, signaling that bears remain active at higher levels.

Select altcoins have continued to move higher, indicating increased investor interest.  

The SPX and the DXY are playing catch-up to Bitcoin following the US-China trade deal.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the new week on a cautious note, falling below $103,000, but the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX) and the US Dollar Index (DXY) have risen sharply following the announcement of the US-China trade agreement. One of the reasons could be that other assets are trying to play catch up with Bitcoin, and the sharp rally in the US dollar may be acting as headwinds for Bitcoin in the near term.

In a May 12 press conference at Gracie Mansion, the the city’s official mayoral residence, Adams said June Ou, founder of financial services company Figure, and Richie Hecker, CEO of private equity firm Traction and Scale, would be assisting the city in its crypto efforts. He spoke of Ou and Hecker acting as advisers for New York City’s next steps in “economic development and opportunities to serve the public using digital assets.” 
“We are focused on the long-term values of these technologies for our city and its people, not chasing memes or trends,” said Adams, adding:

Bitcoin lags as investors shift toward stocks after the US and China strike a deal that could end the current trade war.

Macroeconomic conditions are swinging away from gold investing and back to stocks. 

Bitcoin (BTC) reached its highest price in over three months at $105,720 on May 12, but was unable to maintain its bullish momentum. Interestingly, the drop to $102,000 came after a temporary easing in the US-China tariff conflict. This has left traders puzzled as to why Bitcoin reacted negatively to what seemed like positive developments.
The 90-day truce reduced import tariffs, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the agreement could be extended, provided there is a genuine effort and constructive dialogue. According to Yahoo Finance, the topics under dis…</span>

Possible de-risking ahead of the May 13 CPI print could be playing a role in today’s BTC price correction. 

Bitcoin market structure and qualitative fundamentals remain bullish, suggesting today’s correction could be short-lived.

Bitcoin (BTC) price briefly stumbled on May 12, falling to $102,388 after hitting an intraday high at $105,819 during the US trading session. At first glance, the abrupt correction seemed unexpected given the positive news of the day. Since Sunday evening (May 11), mainstream media headlines have reported on the positive headway made in the US-China trade talks occurring in Switzerland, and throughout the evening, US President Donald Trump ran his victory lab via Truth Social posts heralding the positives of the deal.

Is there a catch for Bitcoin hodlers, with the asset’s price up over 600,000% since the beginning of 2013? 
Perhaps — if governments keep waking up to Bitcoin’s value, the whole “you only pay tax when you sell” mantra could soon be a thing of the past.
What if a wealth tax is the answer for revenue-hungry tax agencies with no time to lose? It’s a yearly tax on a person’s total net worth — cash, investments, property and other assets — minus any debts, applied whether or not those assets are sold or generating income. The idea is to boost public revenue and curb inequality, mainly by taxing the ultra-rich. A wealth tax takes a clip off what you own, not what you earn.

Under the terms of the deal, Gryphon Digital Mining will acquire American Bitcoin in a stock-for-stock transaction. After the merger, the new company will operate under the American Bitcoin brand and be led by its board of directors, which includes Eric Trump, the second-eldest of US President Donald Trump’s three sons. 
News of the merger coincided with a sharp rise in Gryphon Digital Mining’s stock price, which climbed from $0.52 on May 9 to $2.15 at the time of writing, a gain of more than 313%, according to Google Finance.

Though Bitcoin doesn’t support native staking, holders can earn yield through centralized lending platforms, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on Ethereum, and Bitcoin-related networks like Babylon and Stacks.

WBTC allows BTC holders to participate in lending, liquidity pools and yield farming on Ethereum-based DeFi platforms like Aave and Curve but introduces bridge and smart contract risks.

Protocols like Babylon and Stacks use mechanisms like native time-locked scripts or stacking to offer rewards without removing BTC from the Bitcoin blockchain.

Custodial, smart contract and regulatory risks persist. Bitcoin’s community also remains divided on whether Bitcoin yield generation features align with its decentralized and trust-minimized ethos.

                              <span>A 90-day tariff agreement between the US and China may set the stage for a broader recovery of stock and cryptocurrency markets, as investors look ahead to a potential tax relief package.
The White House announced on May 12 that the two countries will reduce their respective tariffs to 10% for an initial 90-day period beginning May 14 — a 24% cut from current levels.  
Speaking at a news conference in Geneva, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said both governments are aligned on avoiding further economic decoupling.  
“The consensus from both delegations is neither side wants to be decoupled,” Bessent said. “What has occurred with these very high tariffs was an equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade. We want more balance in trade.”

                              <span>Crypto exchange Backpack announced that customers of the defunct crypto exchange FTX EU can begin reclaiming their funds through its service.
According to a May 12 X post, Backpack now allows FTX EU users who selected it as the redistribution platform to claim their euro balance. Users must first complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification.
Backpack’s support page also said that the KYC details on the platform must match the ones provided to FTX EU:
“If they do not, you will need to contact Backpack EU support at support@eu.backpack.exchange to update your Backpack EU account to reflect the same information used for your FTX EU claim. This ensures a smooth verification process and avoids delays in accessing your distribution.”

The BIS study, published May 8, found cross-border payments using the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and the two largest stablecoins, USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC), totaled about $600 billion during the second quarter of 2024, the final observation period covered by the analysis.
“Our findings highlight speculative motives and global funding conditions as key drivers of native crypto asset flows,” the BIS said.

RISC-V, pronounced “risk five,” is a modern open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. In simple terms, it’s like a blueprint that defines a set of instructions that a processor can execute.
RISC-V is designed to be highly modular, efficient and flexible. Originally developed by the University of California in 2010, the open-source framework gives developers the flexibility to tailor its functionality and use cases, plus offers cost savings compared to proprietary ISAs like ARM or x86. This offers a wide range of uses, from supercomputers to smartphones and now blockchains like Ethereum.

BTC price action is giving increasingly bullish signals, joined by a key cross on the weekly MACD indicator.

The weekly close fell just short of expectations, raising doubts over whether price discovery will return in the immediate future.

CPI and PPI headline the week’s US macro data drops, but markets are all about the US-China trade deal and its implications.

Bitcoin supply in loss drops below 2% in a rare test of hodlers’ staying power.

Despite the gains, crypto market sentiment remains cool amid a lack of mainstream interest.

In the world of cryptocurrency, security goes beyond just protecting your wallet with a password or private key. One of the most deceptive and increasingly dangerous threats to crypto users today is social engineering.
While you might think of cyberattacks as highly technical affairs, social engineering manipulates the most vulnerable aspect of security: human nature. 
At its core, social engineering refers to the act of manipulating people into divulging confidential information or granting unauthorized access to systems. 
Unlike traditional hacking, which typically exploits technological vulnerabilities, social engineering targets the human element. Attackers rely on deception, psychological manipulation an…</span>
