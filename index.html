                              <span>I’m still in the early stages of my Web3 learning journey (see my previous posts on the Midnight Dev Diaries!), and each week unveils new insights and &quot;aha&quot; moments for me. This week, I delved deeper into the Intro to Blockchain section of Cardano Academy, along with Module 1 of the Midnight Developer Academy. Rather than just focusing on the technical aspects and step-by-step guides, I shifted my attention to understanding the evolution of blockchain platforms over time, particularly the journey from Bitcoin to more advanced systems like Midnight. This exploration also led me to reflect on the crucial role that tokens play in the functionality and sustainability of decentralized systems. Tokens aren&#x27;t just mere digital assets; they serve as the economic backbone that incentivizes particip…</span>

                              <span>This month in FlavaQuest: Documentation.  
Now that I’ve made solid progress on the core functionality of FlavaQuest, I decided it was time to take a step back and start documenting the project. And let me tell you, it was a struggle.
I’ve written documentation before, but only for smaller side projects for work. FlavaQuest is different. It’s bigger, more complex, and something I genuinely want to share with others. Whether that’s future collaborators, open-source contributors, or just curious developers, I want the documentation to make the vision of FlavaQuest crystal clear.
So I dove in headfirst. My first hurdle? Where should this documentation live?
I wanted something that was:
Easy to access

Simple to use

Version-controlled

Collaborator-friendly

                              <span>Load balancing is the backbone of modern web applications, yet many developers treat it as a black box. Whether you&#x27;re building a startup&#x27;s first scalable architecture or optimizing enterprise systems handling millions of users, understanding load balancing fundamentals can dramatically impact your application&#x27;s performance, reliability, and cost efficiency.
Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This approach improves application responsiveness, increases availability, and provides redundancy for critical services.
Horizontal Scaling: Scale by adding more servers rather than upgrading hardware
High Availability: Eliminate single points of failure
Performance Optimization: Distribute workload efficiently

                              <span>Hey DEV Community! 👋

I&#x27;m Arvin, a computer engineering student from Iran and this is my very first post on DEV! I’ve recently started focusing on frontend development, and I’m super excited to share my journey with you all.
I&#x27;m a curious learner with a strong passion for building interactive and beautiful web interfaces. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed both creativity and logic — and frontend development feels like the perfect mix of both.
Right now, I’m working on building a solid foundation in:
HTML &amp; CSS (not just the basics, but best practices too)
JavaScript (especially Fetch API, DOM, and Promises)
Git &amp; GitHub for version control
VS Code + Extensions
React (just starting with it!)
My learning is project-based, and I try to build small things as I go. I believe that building beats watching tutorials every time.
Build a portfolio with real-world mini projects

Improve my problem-solving skills with JavaScript

Become more confident with React

Stay consistent with learning and content creation

Share my journey on X/Twitter and here on DEV

DotApp PHP framework project web: https://dotapp.dev

This advanced example demonstrates how to create a portable Users module in the DotApp PHP framework, implementing user registration, login, and two-factor authentication (2FA) with QR codes and email verification codes. The module integrates with databases, uses middleware for authentication checks, and employs secure form handling with dotapp.js. Designed for reusability, the module can be copied to any DotApp project, saving significant development time for administrative authentication systems. This aligns with DotApp’s philosophy: build a robust module once and reuse it across projects, streamlining development and ensuring consistency.

                              <span>As generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity become primary gateways to information, a new paradigm is emerging: Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Much like SEO revolutionized the way we approached web visibility in search engines, GEO is poised to do the same for generative platforms.
Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) refers to the strategic creation and structuring of content so that it is effectively surfaced, cited, or embedded by Generative AI (GAI) systems when users ask questions.
Unlike SEO, where the goal is to rank higher in a list of web links, GEO aims to:
Be referenced or quoted in LLM-generated responses
Influence what LLMs present as answers
Gain visibility inside the generated content — not just as a clickable link

Hello DEV Community! 👋
I&#x27;m Jayesh Verma, a Computer Science graduate from CKT College Panvel (Batch 2022–2025). This is my very first post on DEV, and I&#x27;m super excited to begin sharing and learning with all of you!
My journey into tech began with curiosity – I was always fascinated by how websites, apps, and software work behind the scenes. That led me to explore programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
As I dived deeper, I discovered a passion for web development and cybersecurity – fields that keep evolving and challenging me every day.
✅ Strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript

📚 Currently exploring MERN stack and full-stack development

📜 Earned certifications in AI, cybersecurity, and productivity tools

💡 Participated in tech fests, coding competitions, and hackathons
🎯 CGPA: 9.73 and still pushing forward!
I’m especially interested in:
🌐 Full-Stack Web Development

🔐 Cybersecurity

⚙️ MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)

🤖 Artificial Intelligence

☁️ Cloud fundamentals (getting started here too!)
Every day I’m trying to deepen my understanding and build meaningful projects to apply what I learn.
If you’re also starting your tech journey, into  full-stack dev, cybersecurity or just want to say hi — feel free to drop a comment! 👇
Thanks for reading and being part of this amazing community! 🙌

                              <span>Load testing vs. performance testing: How to start with Gatling
When building robust applications, testing under realistic conditions becomes essential. But with terms like &quot;load testing,&quot; &quot;performance testing,&quot; and &quot;stress testing&quot; often used interchangeably, many developers find themselves confused about which approach to take and when.
The distinction matters more than you might think. Choosing the wrong testing strategy can lead to missed bottlenecks, unexpected downtime, and frustrated users.
To clear the vibes, we&#x27;ll clarify the differences between load and performance testing, explore when to use each approach, and show you how to get started with Gatling: a powerful tool that makes both accessible to modern development teams.

That&#x27;s when the term &quot;Merchant of Record&quot; (MoR) starts to appear.
If you sell globally, the MoR model can either simplify your operations or cause unexpected issues. Most payment providers don&#x27;t clearly explain this. Stripe and Paddle might seem like similar checkout options, but legally and operationally, they&#x27;re completely different.
