                              <span>Terraform is a great tool. I love it! But when the resource you want to manage is only partially covered, it can get tricky. Today I share a tip on how not to get stuck when Terraform lacks a datasource you wish was there.
For a customer project, I needed to list images in an ECR repository (to declare those images as SageMaker custom images). But Terraform, as of today, doesn&#x27;t have an aws_ecr_images (that would call ListImages) datasource, only aws_ecr_image (that calls DescribeImage if you already know which tag you&#x27;re looking for).
Being a good Boy Scout, I raised a Pull Request on the Terraform AWS Provider. But as dedicated and nice as the provider&#x27;s maintainers can be, it might be a while before my PR gets reviewed and merged. 
In the Terraform AWS provider, there is a very convient resource,  aws_lambda_invocation, that can actually invoke an AWS Lambda with a user-defined input and collect the output in the Request-Response invocation in the resource&#x27;s argument, so that you can use the response in other resources in your stack.
The code snippet provided below is a fully functional example of how to use it.
By default, the resource only performs a single invocation, then is never triggered again. The trigger block makes it possible to decide when to run it (when some other resources is modified... or every time, using timestamp()). The only downside is that any plan will show a resource destruction+creation. 
That&#x27;s all, folks!</span>

                              <span>When working on a recent data visualization project for mapping long-distance train routes, I ran into a performance bottleneck while trying to render high-density GeoJSON line data using Leaflet.js.
The issue wasn’t in basic rendering — Leaflet handles most static maps well. The challenge was in maintaining performance across zoom levels and dynamically switching between multiple layers (routes) on user interaction, especially on mobile.
🔧 Context:
Each route was stored in its own GeoJSON file, and loaded dynamically on selection. Everything worked, until it didn’t.
🚧 Problem:
On mobile, lines wouldn’t always draw properly without zoom interaction
Occasionally triggered Uncaught RangeError in the DOM layer stack when toggling too fast
✅ What Worked:
Reduced file sizes by stripping metadata
Converted multi-polylines into single FeatureCollection objects
Debounced Event Listeners
let routeLoadTimer;
function loadRouteSafely(routeName) {
  clearTimeout(routeLoadTimer);
  routeLoadTimer &#x3D; setTimeout(() &#x3D;&gt; loadRoute(routeName), 250);
}

Viewport-Based Conditional Rendering
if (map.getZoom() &gt; 4) {
  map.addLayer(currentLayer);
}

🧪 Still Exploring:
Switching to MapLibre or GL-based engines
Pre-rendered canvas caching on scroll idle
If anyone else is dealing with performance challenges in dynamic GeoJSON-heavy UIs, especially for real-time route switching or timeline filtering — I’d love to trade notes.

🏁 Final Thought:
Sometimes, the hardest part of building a “simple map” isn’t drawing lines — it’s keeping them smooth, responsive, and scalable for end users with unpredictable behavior.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
If you&#x27;ve recently integrated the Eigen library into your C++17 project, you might have encountered frustrating errors, especially those related to template arguments and undeclared variables. These errors can stem from various factors, such as compiler settings, version compatibility, or conflicts within your project setup. In this article, we’ll explore why these errors occur and provide clear steps on how to fix them to ensure a smooth development experience.
Understanding the Errors with Eigen
Why do these errors occur?
Using the Eigen library effectively requires careful attention to the version you’re using, your project setup, and the specific C++ standard you are compiling with. The errors related to invalid template arguments often indicate that there’s a mismatch bet…</span>

                              <span>When working with JavaScript—whether on the frontend with frameworks like React or on the backend with NestJS—one of the most common data structures is the array. Arrays allow us to store collections of data and offer a wide range of operators and methods to manipulate them efficiently.
In this article, we&#x27;ll explore the main operators and methods you can use with arrays to transform, filter, combine, and analyze information.
An array in JavaScript is an ordered collection of items. It can contain any type of data: numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays.
const numbers &#x3D; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const mixed &#x3D; [1, &#x27;text&#x27;, true, null, [6, 7]];

1. Spread Operator (...)
Allows cloning or combining arrays in a very readable way.
const a &#x3D; [1, 2];
const b &#x3D; [3, 4];
const combined &#x3D; [...a, ...b]…</span>

                              <span>Elm stands out as a language that not only simplifies building web applications but also fortifies your code against a host of runtime errors. At the heart of this reliability lies Elm’s robust type system—a mechanism that ensures every value in your program behaves exactly as intended. In this post, we’ll explore what types in Elm are all about, how they make your code safer, and why embracing them leads to more robust and maintainable programs.
In programming, types are labels that define the nature of data. They specify what kind of values you can work with—for example, numbers, text, or more complex structures. In Elm, types aren’t just annotations; they’re guarantees. When you write a function, you’re providing explicit clues (or letting Elm infer the clues) about what kind of data th…</span>

                              <span>Looking for a way to earn passive income on your crypto without riding the rollercoaster of volatile coins? TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.
Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.

What is tsUSDe, and why use it?
TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.
But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more …</span>

Whenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.
With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?
Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. 
Strength in scarcity
Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically se…</span>

                              <span>Institutional demand for Bitcoin is growing, as Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange, recorded its highest daily outflows of Bitcoin in 2025 on May 9.
On May 9, Coinbase saw 9,739 Bitcoin (BTC), worth more than $1 billion, withdrawn from the exchange — the highest net outflow recorded in 2025, according to Bitwise head of European research André Dragosch.
“Institutional appetite for bitcoin is accelerating,” Dragosch added in a May 13 X post.

The outflow occurred as Bitcoin traded above $103,600 and just days after the White House announced a 90-day reduction in reciprocal tariffs between the US and China, easing market concerns and lifting broader investor sentiment.

Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMs
Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed two key cryptocurrency-related bills that aimed to expand the state’s involvement in digital assets while signing a strict regulatory measure targeting Bitcoin ATMs.
On May 12, Hobbs rejected Senate Bill 1373, which sought to establish a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund. The fund would have allowed Arizona to…</span>

Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.
Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.
“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“
Hu challenged the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital.

The committee held its inaugural meeting at the National Assembly Members’ Hall in Seoul on May 13, the local news agency News1 reported.
During its first meeting, the committee highlighted the importance of resolving regulatory uncertainty and addressing burning issues like stablecoin regulation amid the push for US-dollar stablecoins by the US government.
The new committee joins similar organizations in South Korea, including the Virtual Asset Committee launched in late 2024 and another public-private crypto task force introduced in 2022, both initiated by the Financial Services Commission (FSC).

XRP price has risen 55% since April and is now flashing bullish continuation signals.

Whale flows have flipped positive for the first time since November 2024, historically signaling trend reversals.

A falling wedge breakout projects 40% gains ahead, but $2.80 may act as interim resistance.

XRP (XRP) has bounced by more than 55% since forming a local bottom at around $1.61 in April. It now signals a further price surge owing to bullish technical patterns and onchain data.

Web3 and privacy-focused web browser Brave Browser has integrated the Cardano blockchain into its native and standalone wallets.
According to a May 12 announcement, the integration stems from a partnership between Brave Browser and Cardano development firm Input Output. Together, the two firms “will integrate Cardano into the Brave Wallet, enabling Cardano blockchain access and token management.” Brendan Eich, co-founder and CEO of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT), said:
“Integrating Cardano into Brave Wallet not only expands multi-chain access, but also enhances security, governance participation, and the overall user experience.”

                              <span>Bitcoin defied expectations in April, delivering double-digit gains while posting lower volatility than major traditional assets.
According to analysts at Galaxy Digital, Bitcoin’s (BTC) realized volatility over the past 10 trading sessions dropped to 43.86, lower than the S&amp;P 500’s 47.29 and the Nasdaq 100’s 51.26 — an unusual “positioning for a digital asset traditionally known for its outsized volatility.”
The data point comes against a backdrop of renewed financial turbulence. Since US President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariff announcement on April 2, traditional markets have wobbled.

In a May 12 post on X, Yakovenko proposed a “meta blockchain” to aggregate and order data posted across multiple layer-1 chains, including Ethereum, Celestia and Solana.
“This would actually allow the meta chain to use the cheapest currently available DA offer,” Yakovenko said. 
Data availability layers are third-party solutions ensuring that blockchains have the necessary data to validate transactions.

“Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars,” she stated in her veto letter. “I have already signed legislation this session which allows the state to utilize cryptocurrency without placing general fund dollars at risk,” she added.

                              <span>A British High Court has issued a restraining order against computer scientist Craig Wright preventing him from filing further defamation suits. 
In a May 12 judgment, High Court Judge Edward Mellor said Wright’s repeated false claims and aggressive legal actions created legal “hell” for individuals and developers in the Bitcoin (BTC) community, adding that Wright sought to “weaponise legal systems” to intimidate and silence critics.
His lawsuits forced people into costly and time-consuming legal defenses, often based on fabricated evidence, the judge added as he handed out a General Civil Restraint Order or injunction against Wright, prohibiting him from filing any more civil claims or applications in the High Court.

“There’s no truth whatsoever about Truth Social launching a memecoin. Don’t be fooled by false information people are circulating,” Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of President Donald Trump, stated on X.

The recent filing was part of the prosecutor’s request to sentence him to two years in prison over his role in the hack, which saw the SEC X account publish a false announcement that a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund was approved, shaking up the markets. 
Council searched: “How can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI” and “How long does it take to delete Telegram account,” US prosecutors discovered following a search warrant of his house, car and devices last June, according to a May 12 court filing.

Once the service goes live, individuals and business customers of government entities can pay service fees with crypto through Crypto.com’s digital wallets. The payments will be converted into dirhams and transferred to DOF accounts, according to the DOF.

Dogecoin&#x27;s 38% surge reflects strong market demand, with spot-buyer volumes taking charge since March. 

A bullish MACD crossover has traders predicting a 180% rally, with targets at $0.65 and $1.

Dogecoin&#x27;s (DOGE) price rallied in lockstep with Ethereum over the past 7 days, gaining 38% in May, which is its strongest monthly performance this year. According to CoinGecko, DOGE recorded $4.7 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, ranking fifth among the top cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins). 
The memecoin’s market strength has been coupled with strong onchain insights. Data from CryptoQuant noted that DOGE’s spot taker 90-day cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net difference between buying and selling volume over 90 days, has been &quot;taker bu…</span>

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance has warned that a hacker has again hijacked its domain name system (DNS), sending users to a malicious website.  
In the second attack on its infrastructure in a week, the “curve.fi DNS might be hijacked. Don’t interact!” the team said in a May 12 warning to X.
In a follow-up post to a user asking whether it was a hack or a hijack, the Curve Team said the website “Points to the wrong IP” when users try to visit. A DNS works like a directory that translates domain names into IP addresses.

                              <span>Aave, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has reached a new record of funds onchain, according to data from DefiLlama.
In an X post, Aave said it topped $40.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) on May 12. Onchain data reveals that Aave v3, the latest version of the protocol, has approximately $40 billion in TVL. 
Aave is a DeFi lending protocol that lets users borrow cryptocurrency by depositing other types of cryptocurrency as collateral. Meanwhile, lenders earn yield from borrowers. 
“With these milestones, Aave is proving its dominance in the Lending Space,” DeFi analyst Jonaso said in a May 12 X post. TVL represents the total value of cryptocurrency deposited into a protocol’s smart contracts.
