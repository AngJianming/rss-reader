Ether price printed a rare monthly Dragonfly doji candlestick, which is often seen before major ETH bull market cycles.

ETH is retesting its long-term parabolic support zone that preceded its historic 2017 rally.

The MVRV Z-Score has entered the accumulation zone, signaling undervaluation.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is flashing a combination of technical and onchain signals once seen in the early stages of its 2017 bull run, a cycle that produced over 25,000% gains.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally. Several analysts are also optimistic that Bitcoin’s break will occur to th…</span>

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&amp;P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…</span>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it.

$330 million Bitcoin social engineering theft victim is elderly US citizen
An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.

Prover V2 has 671 billion parameters, making it significantly larger than its predecessors, Prover V1 and Prover V1.5, which were released in August 2024. The paper accompanying the first version explained that the model was trained to translate math competition problems into formal logic using the Lean 4 programming language — a tool widely used for proving theorems.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

                              <span>Crypto was born from an open-source ethos, where code was shared publicly, accessible for review and shaped by community contributions. Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.
But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…</span>

Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Mantra has called for industry-wide cooperation to reduce investor risks in the aftermath of its OM token crash.
On April 30, Mantra published its latest update since the sudden collapse of its OM token, claiming that the incident was “bigger than Mantra.”
“Liquidation cascades could happen to any project in the crypto industry,” Mantra CEO John Mullin warned in the post, pointing to the role of “aggressive leverage positions” on exchanges as a broader threat to investor safety.

FIFA will launch its “FIFA Blockchain,” with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility and aims to provide “better performance, future features, and improved scalability.”
As part of the move, FIFA Collect — its official NFT collection — will migrate from the Algorand blockchain to the new FIFA Blockchain. The migration is scheduled to begin no earlier than May 20, FIFA said.

                              <span>Vanar Chain, a layer-1 blockchain network, has launched a new artificial intelligence-powered compression and data authentication layer designed to address the industry’s longstanding issue with onchain storage.
Vanar Chain is launching Neutron, an AI-native blockchain layer with data compression ratios of up to 500:1, which can reduce a standard 25 megabyte file to just 50 kilobytes, transforming it into a “Neutron Seed” that can be stored on the blockchain ledger.
The new blockchain compression layer aims to solve the industry’s data storage issue, with traditional blockchains lacking the capacity to store data, only to reference it.
This design introduces potential single points of failure. Vanar&#x27;s Neutron aims to solve this by enabling fully onchain, verifiable data storage.

Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price over time, which indicates the uncertainty about the size of changes in an asset’s value.

Bitcoin’s supply-and-demand dynamics, in addition to growing institutional adoption, position it as a potential hedge against inflation in 2025. However, its high volatility and centralization concerns mean it remains a speculative asset rather than a guaranteed safeguard against inflation.
What is inflation? 
Inflation refers to the general increase in the prices of goods and services in an economy over time, leading to a decrease in the purchasing power of money. As prices rise, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Inflation is typically measured by indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the average change in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of goods an…</span>

Set up your Pi Wallet and secure it with a 24-word seed phrase before transferring your coins.

KYC is often required on both CEXs and P2P platforms to transfer and sell Pi Coins.

You can sell Pi through CEXs or P2P platforms, each offering different security, speed and control.

Always do your own research (DYOR) before selling or holding, as expert opinions on Pi’s future vary.

If you’re here, you probably already know what Pi Coin is and just want to figure out how to sell it. However, a recap awaits, in case you need one. 
While the project pitches itself as a way to democratize crypto access through mobile mining, there are some major concerns that have been hard to ignore:

I’m continuing my 30-Day Linux Challenge as part of my preparation for the RHCSA exam and today I’m focusing on something super simple; yet incredibly useful in any Linux environment: checking who you are in the system.
In Linux, knowing which user you are, which groups you belong to and what permissions that gives you is the first step to understanding your access and control. That’s where commands like id, whoami, and groups come in.
These might seem basic at first glance but they’re powerful tools, especially when you’re troubleshooting permissions or setting up access for teams.

Somehow, the bugs seem friendlier at 2 AM. They whisper, not scream. And I whisper back, promising to refactor tomorrow.
Let’s talk about some of the deeply questionable things we developers believe. Not because they’re true, but because they help us survive.
This is the original sin.
It always starts simple. A little automation here, a tiny helper there. Five hours later, it has 12 flags, a YAML parser, and its own README. You start versioning it. Someone asks if they can use it, and you say yes. You are now in tech support.
It was never just a script. It was the gateway drug.
Ah yes. The most permanent word in tech.…</span>

                              <span>We’re excited to announce that Clerk now integrates with Shopify, giving merchants a fully customizable authentication platform with social and biometric sign-in methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), session management and more. Merchants with a Shopify Plus plan can start utilizing this integration today by setting up Clerk as an identity provider (IdP) in the Shopify admin console.
With Clerk’s platform, Shopify merchants can:
Support social sign-in options - preferred by 53% of users and proven to convert 1.3x faster than passwords
Enable passkey authentication, allowing customers to securely log in using device biometrics or PINs - eliminating forgotten passwords and preventing credential stuffing attacks
Enhance security with MFA, blocking 99.9% of account takeover attempts
Offload session management, taking advantage of features like active device monitoring and instant session revocation for improved security
Unify authentication across multiple storefronts and external apps, simplifying management and supporting business expansion
We’re thrilled to bring Clerk’s authentication capabilities to Shopify’s ecosystem, and we can’t wait to see how merchants use these tools to create secure, frictionless shopping experiences.

We present SpectralCentroidTransformer (SCT), a neuroscience-inspired architecture that models language by decomposing the process into oscillatory components and semantic clustering, mirroring established theories of neural information processing. Our architecture separates the language modeling task into two distinct phases: (1) mapping input context to semantically meaningful locations in embedding space via spectral transformations; and (2) interpreting these locations in relation to learned conceptual centroids to produce token distributions. We demonstrate through rigorous experimentation that this approach not only achieves competitive performance on standard NLP benchmarks but also creates more interpretable and robust representations of linguistic concepts. Our results …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve ever been frustrated by how long your WordPress website takes to load, you’re not alone. Website speed is crucial, not just for keeping visitors happy, but also for ranking well on search engines. One way to speed up your site’s performance is by using a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN can be a game-changer for WordPress sites, especially if you’re running a blog or an online store where load time matters.
A CDN works by distributing your content across a network of servers, ensuring that your website loads faster for users regardless of where they’re located. In this article, we’ll dive into the basics of CDNs, why they’re essential for WordPress, and how you can integrate one with your site to boost performance

                              <span>A few weeks ago, I finally decided to start learning web development. I want to become one of the best frontend developers in the world. I know it will take years of hard work, but I truly believe it’s possible.
So, I began with the basics: HTML and CSS. After learning the core syntax and understanding how everything works, I started building small projects to put my knowledge into practice.
In this blog post, I’ll walk through 4 of those mini-projects — like sidebars, login forms, user profile cards, and more. I’ll explain how I built them, and the challenges I faced along the way.

                              <span>When I started building my website, I thought the hardest part would be the technical stuff.
Syntax errors, layout issues, maybe a few bugs here and there. But I quickly realized the real challenge was just getting myself to sit down and start—especially while juggling everything else going on in my life.
I’m self-taught, figuring this out while also trying to put things back together in my life—recovering from a breakup, moving back in with my parents after a tough roommate situation, and sitting squarely in the middle of a career identity crisis. On top of that, I’m managing executive dysfunction, anxiety, and a nervous system that’s been locked in fight-or-flight for years. 
My work ethic has always been tangled up with my emotional state. When I’m drowning, I shut down. When I’m hopefu…</span>

                              <span>The Spring Framework provides several bean scopes that determine the lifecycle and visibility of beans in the application context:
Singleton
Prototype
Request
Session
Application
WebSocket
The last four scopes (request, session, application, and WebSocket) are specifically designed for web applications.
A session-scoped bean in Spring is a bean that is created once per HTTP session and shared across multiple requests from the same user. It remains active until the session expires or is invalidated.
Session-scoped beans are useful for storing temporary, user-specific data.
1. User ID : If a user ID is used across multiple HTTP requests, it&#x27;s better to store it in the session scoped bean rather than querying the database on every request.
2. theme : If the application supports multiple UI themes, the user’s theme preference can be stored in a session-scoped bean to maintain consistency across all requests.
3. User Roles : Once authenticated, the user&#x27;s roles can be stored in a session-scoped bean for quick access during subsequent requests.
4. language : User&#x27;s language preferences (locale) can be stored in a session-scoped bean to maintain a consistent user experience across all requests.
Lifecycle
Created when a new HTTP session starts (e.g., user logs in).
Destroyed when the session expires (timeout, logout, or invalidation).
Each user gets their own instance.
Use Cases
Storing user-specific data (e.g., shopping cart, authentication details).
Maintaining state across multiple requests (e.g., user preferences).
Avoiding repeated database fetches for session-related data.
I noticed many beginners struggle with @SessionScope in Spring. After researching, I made:

                              <span>Hey, automation wizard! 🧙♂️ So you’ve mastered the basics of GitHub Actions—running tests on push, deploying to staging, maybe even sending a Slack cat meme when builds fail. But now your workflows look like a YAML junkyard. Duplicate code everywhere. Jobs that take 3 hours to run. And don’t get me started on maintaining 12 repos with the same CI steps.  
What if I told you GitHub Actions has superpowers to declutter your workflows, slash build times, and make you the DevOps hero your team needs? Let’s dive into reusable workflows, matrix jobs, and custom actions—the trio that’ll transform your CI/CD from “it works” to “it’s chef’s kiss.”  
1. Reusable Workflows: Stop Copy-Pasting YAML


The Problem:

You’ve got 10 repos, each with the same “deploy-to-AWS” job. When AWS updates their CLI,…</span>
