                              <span>The concept of a Russian ruble stablecoin received special attention at a major local crypto event, the Blockchain Forum in Moscow, with key industry executives reflecting on some of the core features a ruble-backed stablecoin might require.
Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

The OCCRP reported on April 28, citing leaked company records and bank statements, that nearly half of the funds from Bankera’s 100 million euro ($114 million) ICO were transferred to a bank in the Pacific Island country of Vanuatu that was purchased by the project’s founders, Vytautas Karalevičius, Justas Dobiliauskas and Mantas Mockevičius.

Lawyers for Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill said in an April 28 letter to Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman that they jointly requested with the government “for a continuance of the pretrial motions schedule by 16 days.”
The Samourai executives&#x27; lawyers said on April 10 that they wrote to Acting Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton to request the dismissal of the case after an April 7 memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche shuttered the Justice Department’s crypto team.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.

Dalio added that this is leading to irreversible damage, and an increasing number of importers and exporters, particularly between the US and China, are drastically reducing interdependencies and “making alternative plans.”

In an April 28 letter to White House crypto czar David Sacks, the group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice&#x27;s lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.” 
The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July, and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins, regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28.
The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them.
He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use …</span>

                              <span>🚀 Mastering JavaScript Event Loop — Simplified for Interviews
↔️  In JavaScript, everything starts with the Call Stack- a synchronous structure (Code Executes LIFO order ).
Because JavaScript is single-threaded, it leans on Browser Web APIs (like setTimeout, fetch, DOM APIs) to handle async operations.
🧠 Browser Superpowers (Web APIs)
Browsers provide extra features beyond the JavaScript engine, called Web 
APIs, including :
setTimeout, setInterval
DOM Manipulation APIs
fetch (for network requests)
localStorage
console
location
Bluetooth access, Geolocation, etc.
These features are accessible via the window object in browsers.
When an asynchronous operation (like setTimeout or fetch) is triggered:
 It is registered in the Web API Environment provided by the browser.
 Once completed (like a timer expiring or a network request finishing), the corresponding callback is placed into queues — waiting for the Call Stack to be free.
🔥 Event Loop
The Event Loop continuously monitors:
If the Call Stack is empty.
If there are pending callbacks in the Queues.
Its main job:
When the Call Stack is empty, the event loop moves queued callback functions to the Call Stack for execution. Callback functions in the Microtask Queue are given priority and executed first Then Callback (Task) Queue.
🧩 Microtask Queue vs Callback (Task) Queue
There are two important types of queues:
Microtask Queue:
Higher priority than the Callback Queue.
Promise .then() / .catch() / .finally() handlers call back functions and  MutationObserver callbacks  function
Callback Queue (Task Queue) :
Lower priority.
Includes:
setTimeout , setInterval , UI rendering callbacks , DOM event callbacks
Important:
Before picking a task from the Callback Queue, the Event Loop empties all microtasks first.</span>

                              <span>You know that moment when you push your code to production, lean back, and wait for Slack to explode?

Yeah... that was me last year, all thanks to a tiny misconfigured Kafka topic.
Long story short:

Messages were flying everywhere except where they needed to go. Consumers were confused, partitions were misaligned, and I spent my Saturday night debugging with the comforting glow of system logs.
If you&#x27;re working with Kafka and Spring Boot, this story is for you.

Let&#x27;s talk about the hard-earned lessons that textbooks won&#x27;t teach you. 💬
When creating Kafka topics, I used to think:

&quot;It’s just a name and some partitions, right? What could go wrong?&quot;

(Answer: Everything.)
Quick Tips:
Always define replication factor wisely. No one likes losing messages because a single broker took a nap.

This article will dive deep into how DolphinScheduler uses ProcessBuilder to execute shell commands. By default, DolphinScheduler wraps shell scripts using BashShellInterceptorBuilder, generating execution commands that support both standard and sudo modes. 
We&#x27;ll also walk through a Spring Boot example showing how to configure working directories, merge output streams, monitor process execution, and output logs — helping you achieve efficient Shell task management and scheduling.
In DolphinScheduler, the command wrapping happens inside:

                              <span>IT consulting is as much about people and strategy as it is about technology. While demand for IT consultants continues to grow in 2025, so does the expectation for flawless delivery, clear communication, and lasting value. Yet even the most experienced consultants can fall into traps that derail projects or damage client relationships.
Here’s a look at the most common IT consulting mistakes—and the smart ways to avoid or fix them.
The mistake: Many consultants rush to recommend tools or architectures without fully understanding the client’s actual business needs. This leads to mismatched solutions, scope creep, or poor adoption.
The fix: Always start with a deep discovery phase. Ask questions that uncover not just the technical pain points, but the underlying business challenges. Listen m…</span>

Not long ago, the path to becoming a better software developer was clearer: curated roadmaps, classic recommended books, structured learning approaches. But now, the global focus has shifted. The fear of being replaced by AI overshadows the intrinsic motivation to improve.
Let us remind ourselves: the purpose of AI is not to instill fear, but to inspire us to become even better. Today, I want to talk about something we all crave but sometimes lose sight of—the joy of building, the feeling of proficiency, and how open source can reignite that passion.

                              <span>In the frozen forges of Winterfell, where tools are tested by winter’s bite, and in the fiery pits of Dragonstone, where circuits crackle like dragonfire, there exists a tool forged in the old ways—the Apex 51CG Pliers. Like Valyrian steel in the hands of a blacksmith, it cuts through chaos with the precision of a Stark’s honor and the unyielding grip of a Lannister’s ambition. Let us declare why this tool claims the Iron Throne of electronics workshops.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Winterfell
51CG is no common ironborn trinket. Tempered in the Fires of Precision, this tool bears the marks of ancient craftsmanship:
Serrated Jaws of the Direwolf: Grips wires with a Stark’s ferocity, leaving no escape for rogue strands.
Why it shatters lesser tools:
Generic Pliers: As reliable as Theon’s loyalty—crumbling under pressure.
Chapter 2: The Battles of the Seven Kingdoms
The Wall of Wire Jungles:
When 30AWG magnet wires swarm like Wildlings, the 51CG becomes Jon Snow at the Battle of Castle Black—slicing through chaos with Longclaw’s edge.
The Red Keep of EV Assembly:
Defends lithium-ion busbars from short-circuit rebellions, as steadfast as Brienne guarding Sansa.
The Dragonpit of Prototyping:
Tames 0201 capacitors with Daenerys’s calm, dodging missteps like Drogon evading scorpion bolts.

The Words of House 51CG
Semi-Flush Edge: Cleaner than Littlefinger’s schemes, leaving wire tips as smooth as Sansa’s diplomacy.
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Cheap Imitations: Crumble like wights in dawn’s light, their edges blunting faster than Joffrey’s reign.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Promised
engineer needs 51CGs. Without them, the realm descends into ‘fuzzy wire’ anarchy.”

                              <span>esProc SPL is much more convenient than DuckDB in operating multi-layer JSON data, particularly when preserving JSON hierarchy and performing complex calculations are required.
DuckDB’s ability to operate JSON is quite good. The read_json_auto() function can directly parse JSON to a table structure, allowing you to operate on multi-layer data directly:
SELECT order_id, order_date, json_extract(customer, &#x27;$.name&#x27;) AS cusName,json_extract(customer, &#x27;$.city&#x27;) AS cusCity FROM read_json_auto(&#x27;orders.json&#x27;)


SPL is simpler for such basic operations:
json(file(&quot;orders.json&quot;).read()).new(order_id, order_date,customer.name:cusname,customer.city:cuscity)

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin gained 10% over the past week, but overhead resistance continues to obstruct a rally to $100,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500.
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below.

Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst
The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions.
Although the rally has been accompanied by $3.06 billion in spot ETF inflows, there are doubts whether that is enough to break Bitcoin out of consolidation.

                              <span>Wallet provider MetaMask is launching a crypto payments card that will allow users to spend self-custodied funds, offering crypto holders additional ways to use their tokens.
The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum.
The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion, an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space.

The DeFi Education Fund has led an April 28 petition to White House crypto czar David Sacks asking to end what it claimed was the “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers, including Roman Storm, a creator of the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash.
The group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice&#x27;s lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.”

                              <span>Despite growing competition from emerging issuers, the stablecoin market remains largely dominated by a few key players. According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt (USDT) continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies.
As of April 25, Tether has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC (USDC), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. 
Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. 
“With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said.

In a third reading on April 28 of Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay.
“This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025.

A week full of US macroeconomic reports could impact Bitcoin traders’ sentiment. 

Bitcoin’s rally could stall if there’s a sharp reduction in spot buy volumes.

If PCE, the ISM PMI, and jobs data align with market expectations, BTC could rally. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price could face a period of range-bound trading after managing a 10.37% rally over the past 7 days. Robust spot purchasing demand from Strategy, the spot BTC ETFs, and announcements from 21Shares and Coinbase played a role in Bitcoin’s rally to $95,700. With the exception of the April 28 announcement of a $1.42 billion BTC purchase from Strategy, a quiet week on the crypto news front could translate to a reduction in spot demand and lower support tests from Bitcoin price.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin’s year-over-year return and realized price metric signal strong long-term support from holders and suggest that BTC is currently undervalued.

 Standard Chartered estimates a Bitcoin price target in the $110,000–$120,000 zone by Q2 2025.

Positive funding rates point to a potential long squeeze to $90,500.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly close near $94,000 delivered an impressive year-over-year total return of 53.61%. Since the last halving in 2024, the market has shifted from the early 2024 euphoric phase to a &quot;mature bull trend&quot; based on onchain growth, rather than speculative frenzy.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin continues to face resistance at $95,000, but the possibility of an upside breakout remains high.

Solid spot Bitcoin ETF inflows do not always signal a short-term top.

Select altcoins are showing early signs of a short-term trend change.

Bitcoin (BTC) pierced the $95,000 resistance on April 28, but the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. This suggests that the bears have not given up and are trying to defend the level. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a move toward $100,000.
Another positive is that institutional demand seems to be back, as seen from the solid $3.06 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds last week. Although some instanc…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

US Treasury funds saw $19 billion inflows, the highest since March 2023, as the 30-year yield fell 30 basis points.

Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%.

Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. 

The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion — the highest since March 2023.

The exploiter pilfered approximately 5.7 million USDC (USDC) and 1,200 Solana (SOL) tokens from two of Loopscale’s yield vaults on April 26, prompting the decentralized finance protocol to temporarily pause its lending markets. 
The following day, the hacker sent a message on the Etherscan blockchain scanner “indicat[ing] a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty,” Loopscale said in an April 27 X post. 
“We are agreeable to collaborating with you to reach a white hat agreement. However, we would like to negotiate the bounty percentage; our expectation is 20%,” the hacker said. “To demonstrate our commitment …</span>

Bitcoin price dropped alongside falling Treasury yields, signaling investors’ flight to safer assets.

Strategy’s $4.28B Bitcoin purchases and stock market strength have supported BTC above $90,000.

A true breakout toward $100,000 will require Bitcoin to decouple from equities and stronger liquidity signals.

Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp $2,000 correction to $93,500 on April 28. This price movement closely tracked the decline in US Treasury yields, suggesting that traders were seeking the relative safety of more secure assets.
While Bitcoin traders are moderately satisfied with the 6% gains achieved over the past week, there is ongoing uncertainty as to why BTC has been unable to maintain levels above $95,000.

Altcoins have lagged Bitcoin year-to-date, but BNB price shows relative resilience, trading only 10% lower than the previous cycle’s all-time high.

BNB Chain shows a robust activity, consistently ranking third in daily transactions, active addresses, and TVL, while leading in the number of DApps.

The blockchain’s weakest point is its revenue, which still lags compared to competitors.

Altcoin price action has been underwhelming for much of the 2023-2026 cycle, pushing many crypto traders to focus primarily on Bitcoin. However, with moderate optimism returning to the markets, a closer look reveals that not all altcoins are struggling. In fact, the total altcoin market cap remains solidly above $1 trillion — $1.17 trillion, to be exact — and its 9% surge over the past week o…</span>

Blockchains were designed as systems of trust that are transparent, decentralized and accessible. The age of AI has, however, introduced significant new challenges. Nearly half of all internet traffic is generated by bots, with up to 80% of blockchain transactions now automated and AI agents accounting for most onchain activity. 
While some bots serve legitimate and helpful purposes, others — like those used for airdrop farming and fake account creation — clog networks, drive up fees, and monopolize space and resources.

                              <span>Update (April 28, 10:26 pm UTC): This article has been updated to add commentary from Tim Beiko that the EOF upgrade was removed from the Fusaka upgrade.
Ethereum’s Fusaka hard fork is expected to take place in the third or fourth quarter of this year, according to an Ethereum Foundation official.
In an April 28 X post, Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak said that the organization is aiming to deploy the Fusaka Ethereum network upgrade in Q3 or Q4 2025. Still, the exact rollout schedule has not been decided yet.
Stańczak said a controversial implementation of the EVM object format (EOF) upgrade for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was expected to be a part of the Fusaka network upgrade, which Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko later ruled out.

In an April 28 interview with CNBC, Chung cited institutional adoption and global liquidity expansion as the primary drivers behind his long-term bullish outlook.
The analyst acknowledged that market conditions this year haven’t been as expected, specifically the challenging macroeconomic environment and market reaction.
However, he described the recent corrections as a “healthy” adjustment, suggesting they have laid a stronger foundation for Bitcoin’s progression toward becoming a mainstream financial asset.
“In hindsight, I think it was actually a healthy correction which has paved the way for the further re-rating of Bitcoin as a mains…</span>

These new high-tech communities were to be created on public land, and they were going to be free of the “nightmare of red tape,” including lengthy environmental reviews, that had hampered the development of affordable housing in many parts of the US.
Freedom cities aren’t really a new idea. They are a rebranding of charter cities, which have been around since the late 1800s. Still, Trump’s proposal won the gung-ho support of many of Silicon Valley’s tech bros, whose backing helped tilt the last US presidential election in his direction, and many of whom — e.g., the PayPal mafia consisting of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel…</span>
