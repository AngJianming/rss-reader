                              <span>What is Abstraction?


Abstraction is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principle that means hiding internal details(or complexities) and exposing only essential parts to the end users. Think of it like using a TV remote — you press a button to switch channels, but you don’t need to understand the circuitry behind it.
In code, abstraction helps keep things clean, maintainable, and secure. Users interact with simple methods, while complex logic stays away.
Abstraction is one of the four pillars of OOP, along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It helps with:
Simplicity: It hides unnecessary complexity.
Security: Sensitive logic or data can be kept private.
Maintainability: Internal changes don’t affect users of the class.
Reusability: You can reuse the same interface acros…</span>

                              <span>1. Introduction


The first time I stumbled upon MongoDB’s aggregation framework, I was in the middle of building a client dashboard for a freelancing project. The client wanted insights—total revenue by category, monthly user activity, and top contributors. I thought simple .find() queries with some frontend filtering would do the job. I was wrong.
Pagination was slow, filtering was clunky, and combining multiple collections felt like reinventing SQL joins in JavaScript. That’s when I realized the real power of MongoDB wasn’t just in storing JSON-like data—it was in how you transform that data. And aggregation pipelines became my go-to tool.
If you’re building admin panels, dashboards, analytics reports, or even gamified leaderboards like I’ve done with TheCampusCoders challenges, aggrega…</span>

The LLM landscape is evolving rapidly - and so are the tools and workflows that developers use to build and improve their LLM applications. To empower our community and invite deeper collaboration, we’ve decided to open source all previously commercial features of Langfuse.
That means you can now self-host features like:
Managed LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations


Annotation queues


Prompt experiments

LLM playground
All fully open under the MIT license.

If you&#x27;re already self-hosting Langfuse, upgrade to the latest version to unlock these new features.

                              <span>Deploying AI agents in production is trickier than most teams expect. What works perfectly in development often becomes a reliability nightmare once real traffic hits.
After looking at incident reports, some clear patterns emerge. The same few issues keep causing the majority of production failures.
42% of AI agent failures come from hallucinated API calls, and another 23% are GPU memory leaks. These aren&#x27;t edge cases - they&#x27;re systematic problems that need systematic solutions.
Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s actually breaking and how to prevent it.
LLMs generate code that looks correct but calls non-existent methods or deprecated endpoints. Traditional validation tools miss this because the code is syntactically valid - it just references APIs that don&#x27;t exist in your environment.

                              <span>Need to translate a document and keep the formatting / layout in place for your company or organization? You’re not alone. One of the most tedious tasks involved in enterprise translation production is file formatting.
In order to translate a document or PDF and keep formatting, layout, images, etc. (a good portion of it), the language translation software you are using must encode the file. These files need to be in a deliverable format matching the original source file. However, many translation tools don’t have the functionality in place to save you hours of time on re-formatting your translated document.
Consequently, you get displaced images, lost font properties and wacky paragraph breaks — or a lack thereof. This becomes especially problematic when you’re tasked with translating doc…</span>

                              <span>Can you remember when you first started here on DEV?

I can even though it&#x27;s been quite long.
I remember the first post I did, circa August 2018, was after I finished a short coding Bootcamp that I got into thanks to a friend.
It&#x27;s the first time I made a post of technical nature online in English (my second language).
I still cringe a little reading it... But it was a stepping stone into technical writing (which I&#x27;d later find out it&#x27;s quite difficult). 
I only started wanting to write for real in January of 2020. Made 2 posts that month, couldn&#x27;t keep up with a regular posting schedule and then you know what happened that year...
With the extra time from being locked down at my home, I resumed the writing at the end of June and then kept going on posting (mostly) weekly for the rest of that year (and then the year afterwards).
It&#x27;s been quite a wild ride with all its ups and downs. 
And maybe it&#x27;s time to come back here to post my learnings and experiences about my new undertaking in the World&#x27;s Largest Hackathon of Bolt(dot)new.</span>

bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSLk https://waf.chaitin.com/release/latest/manager.sh)&quot; -- --en

Please refer to this guide.
Install the latest version of Docker.
If you already have Docker installed, please skip this step.
curl -sSL &quot;https://get.docker.com/&quot; | bash

Create a directory for SafeLine to use, SafeLine will write its configuration and data to this directory. (You need to have at least 5GB of disk space)
mkdir -p &quot;/data/safeline&quot;

Download the latest docker compose script by using the following command.
cd &quot;/data/safeline&quot;
wget &quot;https://waf.chaitin.com/release/latest/compose.yaml&quot;

‼️Important:
