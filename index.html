The SEC’s decision on a spot XRP ETF could ignite a significant rally.

The current $2.2 billion in XRP futures hints at growing institutional investor demand.

The two most bullish events ever imagined by XRP (XRP) advocates happened in 2025, but XRP continues to underperform the cryptocurrency market. On March 6, XRP was listed as a candidate for the United States&#x27; “Digital Asset Reserve,” and Ripple Labs settled a multi-year-long complaint with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8.

Ives joined OpenAI after his startup, io, was acquired by Altman’s company in a $6.5 billion deal, the Journal reported on May 21.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Solana’s bull flag pattern projects a rally to $260, but low spot buy volumes have analysts advising caution.

After briefly dropping to $160 from $184, Solana (SOL) is attempting to reclaim a position above its key resistance at $180 for a second consecutive week. With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting an all-time high, market speculators are banking on eventual capital rotation, which could pump major altcoins like SOL toward new highs.
Solana shows promising signs on the daily chart, forming a textbook bull flag pattern after a strong uptrend. While SOL prices currently trade under $180, a breakout above this level could propel SOL toward its first target at $200, with further upside potential to $220 if momentum sustains.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s rally to new price highs happened as funding rates and trading sentiment remained unusually subdued.

Rising stablecoin supply and global M2 growth indicate untapped liquidity and the potential for further price increases.

Long-term holders are not aggressively selling, reflecting their expectation for continued Bitcoin price appreciation.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high on May 21, with prices rising to $111,860 on Binance on May 22, but the markets lack the state of frenzy associated with new highs. Economist and crypto commentator Alex Krüger noted that “this is the least euphoric new all-time highs” for Bitcoin, after highlighting subdued funding rates for Bitcoin across crypto exchanges.

According to DeLorean, its Build Slot NFT collection grants holders priority access to purchase DeLorean’s upcoming electric car, Alpha 5 EV. The model is the carmaker’s first vehicle in over 40 years, inspired by the iconic flux capacitor from the movie Back to the Future.
The company created an exclusive marketplace for its NFT holders, in which users can buy or trade the NFTs using the USDC (USDC) stablecoin on the Sui network and will be able to earn rewards.

Semiconductors scored a rare exemption from US President Donald Trump’s aggressive reciprocal tariffs, but the relief is symbolic at best. Most semiconductors enter the US embedded in servers, GPUs, laptops, and smartphones. 
The finished goods remain heavily tariffed, some with duties reaching up to 49%. The exemption looks good politically but delivers little practical benefit. Nvidia’s DGX systems, crucial for training advanced AI models, do not fall under the exempted HTS codes. Nvidia could pay effective tariffs nearing 40% on these vital components. Such costs threaten to stall critical AI infrastructure projects across the country.

On May 19, the Senate voted to invoke cloture and move ahead with the GENIUS Act, which would provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The measure passed 66-32, with 16 Democrats supporting the bill.
Democratic concerns over corruption and politicians’ ties to cryptocurrency firms made the bipartisan move controversial. After the vote was finished, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet introduced the STABLE GENIUS Act. The bill would prevent members of Congress from issuing or investing in digital currency and require them to put their crypto in a blind trust while in office.

Investing in digital assets is becoming increasingly important in the “world of the exponential age and currency debasement,” according to Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor.
“You don’t own enough crypto. When you do, you don’t own enough NFT’s, as art is upstream of wealth. Both will never be this cheap again,” Pal said.
NFTs are “the single best long term store of wealth I know and you get to buy it before network effects kick in,” he added in another response.

In this week’s episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Gareth Jenkinson and Nathan Jeffay sit down with StarkWare’s Noam Nisan to unpack how this trustless engine works, why it matters and what’s really at stake.

Understanding staking
Jeffay began by highlighting how staking is part of the backbone that keeps the blockchain running, and runs itself, with volunteers.
“By doing this, they’re saying, OK, we’re taking this task of running the blockchain seriously. Here&#x27;s some of our money. We&#x27;re putting it down. We&#x27;re showing that we&#x27;re serious about doing this.”

Memecoins like Fartcoin, WIF, SPX6900, and Popcat are outperforming Bitcoin in the short term amid renewed crypto market euphoria.

Bullish technical patterns signal more upside for top-performing memecoins.

Popcat stands out with a potential 350% rally, while Fartcoin and WIF also eye significant gains in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin (BTC) has surged 7.35% over the past three days, hitting a new all-time high near $112,000 on May 22, but memecoins are stealing the spotlight. 
Fueled by BTC’s rally, several high-risk tokens are posting even larger gains, stoking possibilities that they could continue to outperform Bitcoin as the crypto bull run accelerates.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP price has gained 4% over the last 24 hours to $2.43, and its open interest has risen by 25%.

Positive spot market activity flips the futures funding rate positive, suggesting a return of investor optimism.

XRP could rally to $14 if a classic bull flag pattern is confirmed.

XRP printed a “bull flag” triangle on the weekly chart, a technical pattern associated with strong upward momentum. Breaking above this technical setup and a surge in XRP futures demand could signal a rally to $14.
Increasing OI rising with XRP price
XRP (XRP) rose in tandem with the wider crypto market on May 22, fueled by Bitcoin’s rally to fresh all-time highs above $111,000. 
XRP price followed with as much as 5.5% gains to an intraday high of $2.45 on May 22 from a low of $2.33 on May 21.

                              <span>The United Kingdom’s Court of Appeal partially dismissed a lawsuit brought by Bitcoin SV investors against major crypto exchanges, including Binance, for allegedly conspiring to delist the token in 2019.
In a judgment handed down on May 21, the court ruled that investors who held BSV through the delisting period (classified as “sub-class B”) were not entitled to billions in speculative damages based on BSV’s hypothetical growth.
These investors had claimed over 8.9 billion British pounds ($11.9 billion) in damages, asserting that Binance’s delisting deprived holders of the chance to profit from BSV’s potential rise to a “top-tier cryptocurrency” like Bitcoin (BTC) or Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
The court rejected this “foregone growth effect” theory, stating, “BSV was obviously not a unique crypto…</span>

Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain, is suspected to have been hit by a massive exploit that may have drained more than $200 million worth of digital assets.  
Pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3 posted on X that “users report” that Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited.” They also shared a screenshot of Cetus market data on DEX Screener, showing many assets losing well over half of their value over the last 24 hours.

                              <span>A crypto trader spent $3.8 million to buy Ether at a significantly higher price after selling the asset for almost the same amount about a month ago. 
On May 22, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain reported that a crypto wallet spent $3.8 million to purchase 1,425 Ether (ETH) at $2,670 per coin, reentering ETH after a major rally. 
On April 13, the same wallet sold 2,522 ETH for $3.9 million, when the asset was trading at about $1,570, a decision that, in retrospect, looks poorly timed. 
“Think twice before selling your bags,” Lookonchain wrote, highlighting the potential gains if the trader just held on to their Ether instead of selling and repurchasing it at a higher price point.

Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”
Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research.

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

                              <span>Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. 
On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. 
Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”
Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many.

                              <span>What is shilling in crypto?            
            
                
At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

The message came after the attacker swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. 
ZachXBT flagged the message on his Telegram channel, linking it to the same entity responsible for the Coinbase data breach affecting at least 69,400 users.

Welcome to the era of Hybrid Cloud Architecture, a strategy that combines the best of both private and public cloud environments to deliver flexibility, scalability, and security, all while aligning with unique business requirements.
But here’s the catch: many organizations still struggle to understand what “hybrid” truly means beyond marketing jargon. Let’s break it down and see why it&#x27;s more than just a trendy phrase, it’s a blueprint for the modern enterprise.
So, What Is Hybrid Cloud?
Unlike a purely public or private model, hybrid architecture gives you:

Today was no different 😔
Ollama&#x27;s announcement of devstral stopped me in my tracks. They specifically touted that the Minstral AI model was &quot;designed to excel at agentic coding tasks&quot;.
When testing models for agentic capabilities, I run through a sequence of prompts. Here&#x27;s how devstral performed.
Note that I lowered the temperature of devstral to 0.2, which is better for exact tasks like tool calls. However, at its default temperature, the results were comparable.

This beginner-friendly video will help you understand the fundamentals of OOP and how they apply to JavaScript in a practical, real-world way.





  
  
  📌 What You’ll Learn


✅ What is OOP and why it&#x27;s important

✅ Core OOP concepts:  
Classes

Objects

Methods

Properties



✅ How OOP helps you write clean, modular, and maintainable code

✅ Simple code examples using modern JavaScript (ES6+ syntax)

✅ A mini real-world example to reinforce your understanding
Even though JavaScript started as a prototype-based language, modern JS (ES6+) supports class-based syntax that makes learning and applying OOP concepts easier than ever. If you&#x27;re planning to work with frameworks like React, Angular, or Node.js, having a good grasp of OOP is essential.

But the open source landscape for PDF handling is fragmented. Each library serves a slightly different purpose, with varying degrees of browser or Node.js support, form capabilities, and flexibility. In this article, we compare the most relevant libraries in 2025 and highlight which use cases they best serve.
Before we dive into individual libraries, here’s a quick side-by-side look at how the top JavaScript PDF tools compare in terms of use case, support, and developer experience.

These plugins determine how your database changes get formatted and delivered—whether you&#x27;re replicating to another Postgres instance, streaming to Kafka, or delivering changes to a webhook.
But what exactly are these plugins, and how do they differ in practice? Let&#x27;s dive in with a concrete example and explore your options.
To understand how different output plugins work, let&#x27;s start with a simple scenario. We&#x27;ll set up logical replication, make a change, and see how different plugins format that change.
First, you need to enable logical replication in PostgreSQL. You can read the Sequin docs to get specific instructions for Postgres providers li…</span>

So I&#x27;ve got this habit of keeping my MikroTik router updated to the latest firmware version. Usually, it&#x27;s smooth sailing - upgrade, reboot, everything works perfectly. But recently, I hit a weird snag that had me scratching my head for a while.
I just upgraded my MikroTik from version 7.18.2 to 7.19, expecting the usual seamless experience. Instead, my users suddenly couldn&#x27;t browse the internet. Not exactly what you want to hear on a Monday morning! 😅
Time to fire up WinBox and see what&#x27;s going on.
After connecting to my router, I started digging through the logs and found this lovely error message repeating over and over:

DoH server connection error: SSL: ssl: no trusted CA certificate found (6)

Well, that&#x27;s not good. DNS over HTTPS was basically throwin…</span>

                              <span>Introduction


Basic Unix permissions (rwx) work well for many scenarios—but they can fall short when we need fine‑grained access control. Access Control Lists (ACLs) extend the traditional model, allowing you to grant specific permissions to additional users or groups without altering the file’s primary ownership.
ACL management is a core skill assessed in the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) exam and is vital for real‑world multi‑tenant environments.
📌 This guide focuses on the exact depth of ACL knowledge required for RHCSA, with practical demonstrations you can reproduce in a lab.

                              <span>Claude 4 finally released! I just witnessed something that made my 25+ years of coding experience feel ancient.
Anthropic dropped Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet at their first-ever developer conference, achieving a 72.5% SWE-bench score — not just beating the competition, but obliterating them.
Quick SWE-bench explainer: It&#x27;s the gold standard for testing AI coding ability. Real GitHub issues from popular Python repos, where AI must understand the codebase, write fixes, and pass actual tests. Think debugging in the wild, not toy problems.
Remember when we used to manually debug for hours? Those days are officially dead.
BENCHMARK DESTRUCTION:
🎯 Claude 4 Opus: 72.5% SWE-bench

🎯 Claude 4 Sonnet: 72.7% SWE-bench (yes, Sonnet beat Opus!)
