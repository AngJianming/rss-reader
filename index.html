                              <span>Bitcoin has reclaimed $98,000 for the first time in almost three months after the US Federal Reserve said it would keep interest rates the same for another month.
The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates.
Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk
Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation.
He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due…</span>

Core Scientific’s Q1 2025 results, shared on May 7, saw it more than double its $210 million net income from the year-ago quarter, while its total revenue reached $79.5 million, missing Zacks analysts&#x27; estimates by 8.11%, and falling from its $179.3 million in revenues for Q1 2024. 
The firm’s primary source of revenue came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue, $3.8 million in hosted mining revenue, and $8.6 million in colocation, formerly listed as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting.

Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on May 7, which allows Arizona to claim ownership of abandoned digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications within three years.
The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.
“This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” the bill’s sponsor, Jeff Weninger, said in a May…</span>

“I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US.
Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.”

                              <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explore common issues that can arise when running an Ansible playbook from a Bash wrapper script. If you often find that your script stops unexpectedly without any error logs, you&#x27;re not alone. This guide will provide insight into potential causes and solutions.
Understanding the Problem
When executing a complex Bash script that triggers an Ansible playbook, there are several layers involved that can contribute to abrupt script termination. In your case, you&#x27;ve set up a logging mechanism and even an EXIT trap, but the absence of logs suggests that the script might be exiting prematurely without triggering these mechanisms.
Common Causes of Unexpected Behavior
Several factors could lead to your script stopping unexpectedly:

We’re the generation raised with Google, born into WiFi, and fluent in memes. But now there’s a new tool on the block — AI — and it’s leveling the playing field faster than we can scroll through TikTok. At the heart of using it well? Prompt engineering.
Let’s get real: If you&#x27;re a Gen Z dev and you&#x27;re not learning prompt engineering, you&#x27;re sleeping on a skill that’s gonna separate the script kiddies from the software wizards.
Prompt engineering is the art of talking to AI — but with precision, intention, and style. It’s how you get the best, most relevant, most mind-blowingly useful outputs from tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and whatever else drops next month.

Spin SDK for JavaScript and its tooling underwent a major overhaul to ensure we meet developers where they are and align with popular patterns, tools and idioms.
As part of that journey, we moved the HTTP router capabilities from the Spin SDK for JS. Instead of exporting a router through the Spin SDK, we let users pick and choose their preferred router. In this post, we’ll explore how to use the Hono Router to build full-fledged HTTP APIs with Spin and TypeScript.
The Hono Router is a fast, lightweight routing system designed for handling HTTP requests efficiently. It features an intuitive, Express.js-inspired API, making it easy to define routes using methods like app.get(), app.post(), and wildcard patterns. Hono also supports middleware, allowing developers to add func…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
If you&#x27;re working with TypeScript and enums, you might encounter situations where not handling all enum cases can lead to runtime errors. As seen in the provided code snippet, the Color enum is defined with three values: Red, Green, and Blue. However, not all cases are handled in the getColorName function, which could lead to unexpected behavior. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to structure your TypeScript code to ensure that missing enum cases are flagged at compile time, helping you avoid bugs before they occur.
Understanding the Issue
In TypeScript, when you use enums, it’s crucial to handle every possible value gracefully. If you forget to handle one of the cases, your function may perform as expected during testing but fail in production, leading to hard-to-debug runti…</span>

When people with disabilities try to use my app with a screen reader, it doesn&#x27;t work. The screen reader skips those 9

A certain database table records the monthly sales of different products, where the values of the products are unknown.

Task: Now we need to group by product and month, sum up sales amount, and then convert products from rows to columns.

SQL：
SELECT format(
$f$
SELECT * FROM crosstab(
   $q$
   SELECT month, product, sum(amount)
   FROM   ventas
   GROUP  BY 1, 2
   ORDER  BY 1, 2
   $q$
 , $c$VALUES (%s)$c$
   ) AS ct(month int, %s);
$f$  -- end dynamic query string
            , string_agg(quote_literal(sub.product), &#x27;), (&#x27;)
            , string_agg(quote_ident  (sub.product), &#x27; int, &#x27;) || &#x27; int&#x27;
                 )
FROM  (SELECT DISTINCT product FROM ventas ORDER BY 1) sub;

When SQL performs row-to-column conversion, column names must be written out, and the actual SQL must be dynamically generated using the preprocessed SQL above before executing the actual SQL, which is cumbersome. Using stored procedures can merge two steps into one, but the structure is more complex.
SPL: The row-column conversion function of SPL does not need to write column names. 👉🏻Try.DEMO

A1： Load data.
A2： Keep the month column unchanged, convert the products from row to column, and the amount is the column value. The pivot function is used for row-to-column conversion, and @s represents aggregation operation during conversion.

Despite their bloated code, security posture, and wasteful resource usage, we as developers remain fully bought into the idea that to build services, we must build long-running always-on servers. Serverless v1, as a programming pattern, may have been too clumsy and slow. But the new generation of serverless is powerful enough to entice us away from the socket server paradigm.
The microservice design pattern calls for services to be “disposable” in the sense that an instance of the service can be killed off and another instance started without losing any important information. Statelessness is not just a virtue, but requirement of the pattern. And yet…
In the ever-popular 12-Factor Manifesto, the sixth factor states:

When building HTTP APIs with Spin, performance matters—not just in raw response time, but also in startup latency and memory footprint, especially for WebAssembly modules running in constrained environments.
In this post, we will break down the performance characteristics of three approaches to routing in Spin applications written in JavaScript or TypeScript:
Using the Hono Router
Using the Itty Router
Using no router at all, writing direct logic in Spin’s handler
Spin apps are built for speed, fast startup, tiny binaries, and low-latency execution. However, when every millisecond counts, even your choice of router can become a bottleneck. Adding unnecessary abstraction could impact the overall application performance. That’s why it’s critical to understand the tradeoffs …</span>

Built from the ground up, it operates independently of other agent frameworks, offering developers both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control.
CrewAI enables developers to build AI agent teams — referred to as “crews” — that work together to tackle complex tasks. Each agent within a crew is assigned specific roles, goals, and tools, allowing for seamless collaboration and autonomous decision-making. This role-based architecture facilitates the creation of AI systems that can delegate tasks, make decisions, and collaborate effectively, much like a real-world team.

                              <span>In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to render a list of map elements inside a DataTable widget in Dart. Specifically, we will be focusing on displaying each element sequentially in rows. For our example, we have a list containing IDs and names, and we want to create a DataTable that showcases this data.
Understanding DataTable in Flutter
The DataTable widget in Flutter is a powerful tool for displaying information in a structured tabular format. It helps to present data in an organized way, making it easier to read and interpret. In our case, we will create a table that holds an ID and a Name column, iterating over a predefined list that contains these data pairs.
What Is Our Data Structure?

Kurt Vonnegut famously said:
...The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable.
I didn&#x27;t listen. I wanted both.
Social Distortion and Youth Brigade did it in the classic punk documentary, &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;. They crisscrossed the country in an old, beat-up school bus. They chugged beers, played shows, and got the girls and it all worked out. 
I mean, Social D plays the Ryman now when they pass through Nashville. That&#x27;s pretty good considering they came from such humble beginnings. Youth Brigade? ...hmm, I&#x27;m not sure, they probably broke up.
Well, I was going to end up like Social D, anyhow, so it didn&#x27;t matter. Actually, I wasn&#x27;t hellbent on playing the Ryman or even getting that big. I just wanted to make …</span>

Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.
Tokenizing securities instead of providing direct exposure can offer several advantages: reduced costs by eliminating traditional financial infrastructure, enhanced accessibility, faster settlement…</span>

                              <span>What to know:

Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.

Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.

Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?
The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide…</span>

During the past year, BNB Chain has benefited from multibillion-dollar inflows into DeFi, US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and rising trading volume at affiliated centralized exchange (CEX) Binance. 
Consequently, the blockchain network’s native BNB token (BNB) has emerged as among the market’s most resilient cryptocurrencies, surpassing all-time highs in the first quarter of 2025 even as the broader crypto market trended downward.

Reclaiming the $2,200 level remains the first price challenge for ETH. 

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

                              <span>Strive Asset Management, founded by entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, has revealed plans to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company.
According to a May 7 announcement, Strive is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC).
The deal will see Strive merging with Asset Entities — a social media marketing company listed on the Nasdaq. The combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and use its access to the public equity markets to finance Bitcoin purchases, the company said. 
Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue approximately $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. The asset manager “intends to use all available mechanisms to build a Bitcoin war che…</span>

Bitcoin price hangs near $97,000 as traders await today’s FOMC minutes.

Bitcoin holding $95,000 as support is key for bullish price expansion in the short term.

Select altcoins are holding their respective support levels, opening the gates for a short-term rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are trying to knock down the immediate resistance at $97,895 and challenge the all-important $100,000 level.

Bitcoin investors are making the most of the highest price levels in several months by cashing out profits.

These are averaging $1 billion per day, leading to concerns that the market comeback may stall or even reverse.

Institutional participation has not led to a change in mindset, CryptoQuant says.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “local top or sharp correction” if current levels of profit-taking continue, new research warns.
In a “Quicktake” blog post on May 8, onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant flagged elevated realized profits among BTC investors.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What&#x27;s holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech&#x27;s fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook&#x27;s dominance?

The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

According to a May 7 BVNK announcement, the startup “secured a strategic investment from Visa through their Visa Ventures arm.” Furthermore, while the company does not explain fully what it entails, it refers to the investment as “more than capital” and describes it as a partnership. The company’s CEO, Jesse Hemson-Struthers, wrote:

At the Blockchain Baddies side event during Token2049 in Dubai, women shared personal experiences of entering the Web3 world and why they believe more female participation is essential for the future of crypto.
In interviews with Cointelegraph, community members said the path forward begins with simplifying technical concepts and fostering environments where women can learn and grow.

Launched in early March with a $3.5 million supply, USD1 has expanded into a market cap of $2.2 billion at the time of writing, leaving rival stablecoins First Digital USD (FDUSD), PayPal USD (PYUSD) and Tether Gold (XAUT) behind, according to data from CoinGecko.

                              <span>Cryptocurrency miner Diversified Energy quietly vacated a natural gas-powered crypto mining site in Elk County, Pennsylvania, reportedly leaving behind unplugged wells and regulatory violations.
The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

“I’m not sure that confidence would have been there three or four years ago,” Rocca told Cointelegraph. “But today, people are more comfortable to borrow against Bitcoin because we’re nowhere near the levels that would trigger liquidation.”
