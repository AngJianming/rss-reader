                              <span>How I Got Out of a recent Coding Rut. We don’t talk about it enough, but here it is. Sometimes at least as a beginner, coding just feels off or unnatural.


Your fingers are on the keyboard, your IDE is open, but your brain? It’s completely somewhere else. Maybe it’s just the burnout talking, or maybe it’s imposter syndrome, or maybe you’ve just hit a wall.
I’ve been there. Recently I was working on my most recent game development project and I was in the same situation. Stuck and nowhere to go and no one to turn to. So here’s what helped me get out, and what might help you too...
Shift From Output to Curiosity
When I’m in a rut, I tend to focus on what I’m not producing — “I should be building more,” “I haven’t shipped anything in weeks,” etc.
Learn Something You Don’t Need
Learning without pressure is powerful. Last month, I started learning a new programming language. Not because I needed it for work or the project I was working on, but because it felt like a challenge that excited me. A new perspective to help me grasp a better understanding. Suddenly, I was looking forward to coding again.
Reorganize Your Dev Environment
This one surprised me. I spent a weekend tweaking my terminal setup, updating my VS Code theme, and cleaning up old repos. Small things, make a big difference.
Hopefully this can help you guys as well, I&#x27;m not that experienced but I try to help whenever possible and share my point of view. That&#x27;s all for me now. Cheers!</span>

Whether you&#x27;re an aspiring data analyst, software developer, or someone looking to boost your resume, understanding Structured Query Language (SQL) will put you ahead of the curve. In this SQL tutorial point, we’ll walk you through what it really means to master SQL, how to approach learning it step-by-step, and how practice sets can transform your understanding from theory to real-world application.

SQL is the universal language of data. It&#x27;s used in nearly every industry that deals with databases—finance, healthcare, e-commerce, education, government—you name it. Whenever information is stored, retrieved, updated, or deleted in a database, SQL is likely involved. It&#x27;s the foundation for int…</span>

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy, Sorting, Heap (Priority Queue), Prefix Sum
You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries where queries[i] &#x3D; [li, ri].
Each queries[i] represents the following action on nums:
Decrement the value at each index in the range [li, ri] in nums by at most 1.
The amount by which the value is decremented can be chosen independently for each index.
A Zero Array is an array with all its elements equal to 0.
Return the maximum number of elements that can be removed from queries, such that nums can still be converted to a zero array using the remaining queries. If it is not possible to convert nums to a zero array, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: nums &#x3D; [2,0,2], queries &#x3D; [[0,2],[0,2],[1,1]]
Output: 1

For women, especially, the right pair of glasses can accentuate facial features, complement outfits, and even boost confidence. Today, shopping for eyeglasses for women is as much about visual clarity as it is about self-expression and everyday comfort. The challenge lies in striking the perfect balance between style, utility, and wearability—and that’s exactly where a thoughtfully designed eyewear experience stands out.

                              <span>In the landscape of modern web services and distributed systems, Representational State Transfer (REST) stands as a cornerstone architectural style. Its principles guide the creation of scalable, stateless, and cacheable web APIs that are relatively simple to understand and use. Central to grasping the essence of RESTful API design is a profound understanding of two fundamental concepts: resources and collections. These elements are not just technical jargon; they are the very building blocks upon which intuitive, effective, and maintainable APIs are constructed. For the myriad of things that use a api—from sophisticated web applications to mobile apps and IoT devices—a well-defined resource model translates into predictable interactions and a smoother development experience.

                              <span>Pukan, Bye-Bye! is a minimalist hardcore platformer where death at every step isn’t a bug but a core mechanic. The game has long been available on various platforms, including Steam and consoles, and now it’s freely accessible in the browser at yoka.net (Yoka Games).
It all started with a desire to dive into the gaming industry but without spending months creating a game from scratch. I wasn’t planning to immediately develop a large indie project or launch a team. I wanted to go through the entire cycle “from release to publication” using an existing game.
I was acquainted with Artalasky — the author of Pukan, Bye-Bye! — through collaboration on the Craftpix.net project. I knew he already had several completed games, and one of them fit my needs perfectly. We quickly found common ground, d…</span>

                              <span>In this article, we review a variable named noOp. This is something I found in logger.ts file in the n8n source code.

When I saw this line below, what it tells me straight away is that it’s something to do with no operation :
const noOp &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {};

When you look at this, it’s doing nothing. I mean, it’s just an arrow function that returns an empty object So you might be wondering how is this used? So that’s what we will find out.
When I click on the no-op, these are the symbols I found on the right side and in the same file, I see that this variable is used at line 103.

When I click and jump to that line, you will see that this is inside a function called setLevel.
 private setLevel() {
  const { levels } &#x3D; this.internalLogger;

                              <span>Recently, a zk user reported that they couldn&#x27;t tab through all interactive elements on a zul page. This behavior is tied to a little-known setting deep in Safari’s Settings.
Keyboard navigation is essential for accessibility, allowing users who rely on keyboards or assistive technologies to navigate without a mouse. It also benefits power users who prefer using Tab for faster navigation. If this doesn&#x27;t work as expected, especially on Safari — one of the major browsers — it can be a frustrating and invisible blocker.
Assuming I create a page with a textbox, menubar, menuitem, anchor link, intbox, navbar, and navitem, and visit it with various browsers.
When pressing the Tab key in Chrome (136.0), Firefox (138.0), and Edge (136.0), I can successfully move through all components, including each link, menu item, and nav item.
But within Safari (18.4), I can only focus on some components. Safari will skip most menu items, links, and nav items.
You can try the page on zk fiddle with your Safari.

I found the root cause is:
The option “Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage”  in Safari Settings is unchecked by default.

After I checked that option, I can focus on all components by pressing the Tab key. If it’s unchecked, you have to press Option + Tab key to focus on all components.</span>

                              <span>API versioning is an indispensable discipline in the lifecycle of any application programming interface. As APIs evolve with new features, bug fixes, or fundamental architectural changes, a robust versioning strategy is paramount to ensure smooth transitions for client applications and maintain a stable ecosystem. Many development teams, drawing from their experience with software libraries, naturally gravitate towards semantic versioning (SemVer), a widely adopted standard that uses a three-part MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH numbering scheme. However, while SemVer offers undeniable clarity for software packages, its direct and granular application to version REST API endpoints can introduce unnecessary complexity, operational overhead, and a less-than-ideal experience for API consumers.

Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities. 
Synthetix strategy lead Ben Celermajer told Cointelegraph that other community concerns were the three-month token lock-up period and the deal’s price, part of which Synthetix tried to address with no lock-up for holders of les…</span>

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.

                              <span>America’s powerful banking lobby is “panicking” over the potential of stablecoins to disrupt their traditional business model, particularly when it comes to yield-bearing stablecoins, according to Austin Campbell, a New York University professor and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting. 
In a May 21 social media post that begins with, “The Empire Lobbies Back,” Campbell claimed that the banking industry is especially alarmed by the potential for stablecoins to offer interest or rewards to holders. 
In a pointed message aimed at Democratic lawmakers, Campbell wrote that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.” 
He went on to explain how fractional reserve banking enables banks to maximize profits while offering depositors minimal interest.

The Bitcoin Quantile Model shows “heat” with price on the verge of an “acceleration phase,” echoing Q4 2024 when BTC embarked on a 45% post-election rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has formed a new intraday high on each daily candle this week, with the crypto asset slowly grinding toward a new all-time high. In line with its current trajectory, 21st Capital co-founder Sina noted that Bitcoin is approaching a pivotal moment around the $108,000 level. 
The Bitcoin Quantile Model update shows that BTC’s market reflects the same “heat” that was present after US President Donald Trump’s post-election rally and the spot ETF-driven highs during Q4 2024.

Ethereum holders are back in profit, increasing chances for a rally to $3,000 and beyond.

Ether sell pressure risk exists at $2,800, where 2.27 million ETH could be sold.

Ether&#x27;s recent surge to $2,700 on May 14 pushed its value above its realized price, implying that the average holder of ETH is “now back in an unrealized profit,” according to Glassnode.
Ethereum trades above its cost basis
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that Ether’s (ETH) price has risen by more than 52% to a three-month high of $2,700 on May 14 from $1,800 on May 7, fueled by excitement around the Pectra upgrade.
This rally has seen ETH rise above its realized price or cost basis, currently at $1,900, paving the way for a potential rally to $3,000 or higher.

Bitcoin (BTC) set a new high of $109,400 on May 21, rising more than 26% in the past month, according to data from TradingView.

The crypto community often experiences periods of heightened anxiety. Market downturns are often triggered by counterproductive sentiment-driven events rather than by fundamental issues, creating a significant disconnect between price behavior and the actual progress being made within the industry by the companies within it. What often goes unnoticed is how much real development happens during these downturns. While market movements capture most of the attention, teams are building faster and more deliberately behind the scenes than ever. The focus shifts away from price speculation and toward real execution. Growth happens during downturns. It&#x27;s a necessary phase for projects that thrive in a volatile industry.

Properly accounting for crypto assets on your balance sheet is essential for accurate tax reporting and financial transparency.
Crypto trading activities should be recorded like stock trading, at fair market value on the day of purchase.
In some countries, like the US, crypto losses can offset gains, so keeping track of gains and losses is important for reducing taxable income.
Whether you’re an individual investor or a business, treating cryptocurrencies as assets and documenting them ensures compliance with tax laws and minimizes the risk of errors.

Let’s be real, it’s easy to lose sight of what you’ve actually gained or lost, especially when it comes to crypto and its market volatility and frequent trading activities.

                              <span>Stablecoin adoption among institutions could surge as the United States Senate prepares to debate a key piece of legislation aimed at regulating the sector.  
After failing to gain support from key Democrats on May 8, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act passed the US Senate in a 66–32 procedural vote on May 20 and is now heading to a debate on the Senate floor.
The bill seeks to set clear rules for stablecoin collateralization and mandate compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws.

“This act doesn’t just regulate stablecoins, it legitimizes them,” said Andrei Grachev, managing partner at DWF Labs and Falcon Finance.

                              <span>Guatemala’s largest bank, Banco Industrial, has integrated crypto infrastructure provider SukuPay into its mobile banking app, allowing locals to more easily receive remittances powered by blockchain technology. 
SukuPay’s infrastructure has been fully embedded inside the Zigi payment app, allowing Guatemalans to receive funds from the United States instantly for a $0.99 flat fee, the company disclosed on May 21. 
Users of the Zigi app do not need a crypto wallet or an International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to receive the funds, the company said. 
SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph that the “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user” so that there are no technical barriers.

In a May 21 post on X, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng Kit-Chong said the bill had passed its third reading, clearing the final hurdle for adoption.
“It is expected that by the end of this year, major institutions will be able to apply to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to become licensed stablecoin issuers,” Ng said.

According to the new Hong Kong legislation, stablecoins must be backed by fiat currency as underlying assets. Ng said Hong Kong is welcoming “global enterprises and institutions interested in issuing stablecoin…</span>

One of the biggest winners is Pendle, a decentralized protocol that enables users to lock in fixed yields or speculate on variable interest rates. Pendle now accounts for 30% of all yield-bearing stablecoin total value locked (TVL), roughly $3 billion, the firm said in a report shared with Cointelegraph.  
Pendle noted that stablecoins make up 83% of its $4 billion total value locked, a sharp rise from less than 20% just a year ago. In contrast, assets such as Ether (ETH), which historically contributed 80%–90% of Pendle’s TVL, have shrunk to less than 10%.
