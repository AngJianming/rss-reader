Hello friend ,
if you are reading these lines it means that you achieved  the 4th part of our series where we are trying to understand how web servers work under the hood, what challenges it faces, what approaches and concepts are used, and what pros and cons they have. If you are already here, you already learned or refreshed so many things: structure of http protocol, threads in Linux, lexical analyse, sockets, basics of networking and servers. It is…</span>

                              <span>Writing clean SQL is about more than just correctness—it&#x27;s about clarity. SQL comments help you communicate with others (or your future self) by adding context, notes, or temporarily disabling code. Let’s explore how to use comments effectively.
Using Comments in SQL



  
  
  Two Main Types:




Single-line
-- Pull users created in the last week
SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at &gt;&#x3D; CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL &#x27;7 days&#x27;;

Multi-line
/*
  Use this version for reporting
  Includes only verified accounts
*/
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE verified &#x3D; TRUE;

Why and When to Comment


Helpful When:
Writing complex logic
Sharing scripts with a team
Disabling old queries during testing
Avoid:
Leaving sensitive info
Explaining simple queries
Letting comments go stale
Different Engines, Different Capabilities




MySQL: Supports versioned comments /*! */.
PostgreSQL: COMMENT ON lets you label schema elements.
SQLite: Keeps it basic and portable.
SQL Server &amp; Oracle: Great for documenting stored code and schema.
FAQ



  
  
  How do I add comments in SQL?


Use -- for quick notes or /* */ for multiple lines or blocks.
Yes—wrap code in /* */ and it won’t run.
Yes, both styles are widely supported with small engine-specific features.
Only if they include secrets or mislead developers. Keep them clean and relevant.
Conclusion


SQL comments don’t take much effort but make a big difference. They’re your best tool for writing collaborative, maintainable SQL scripts. Read SQL Comment: A Comprehensive Guide  for more insights.</span>

Python lets you use many characters to write programs. But some characters cannot appear in code unless they are part of a string or a comment. These are  forbidden characters.
@   $   ?

Forbidden characters are printing ASCII characters that Python does not use in its grammar. If you write one outside a string or comment, Python will stop with a syntax error.
Python raises an error if you use a forbidden character in code.
price$ &#x3D; 5  # Error
print(&quot;Price: $5&quot;)  # OK

The character $ is forbidden in names or expressions, but it is allowed inside strings.
As of Python 3, the main forbidden characters are:
@   $   ?

These characters are part of the printable ASCII set. They are legal in strings and comments, but illegal in code structure…</span>

Loneliness is an epidemic. Even with digital access to people across the globe, human connection seems harder and harder to come by. One of the most emotionally taxing struggles faced by many people involved in modern-day interpersonal relationships is &quot;ghosting&quot; - cutting someone out entirely without even a chance for explanation. But come 2025, something almost ghostly helps with loneliness - a companion.
AI companions are all the rage by 2025. Fueled by what technology can offer at the time, AI companions try to fill a very human void. And with so many people feeling lonely, from children to adults to the elderly, why not turn to virtual companionship to soothe the gaps?

Instead of memorizing 500+ problems, learning the core patterns helps you recognize solutions faster and build confidence. 💪🏻
Used in problems like maximum sum subarray, longest substring without repeating characters, or minimum window substring, this pattern helps you dynamically maintain a window over the input (usually arrays or strings) while optimizing for performance.
Why it matters:
dynamically, focusing only on what&#x27;s relevant inside the current window. Mastering this is a cheat code for string and subarray problems.

Yes. As you can see, this is the classic Chrome offline Dino Runner game, but in command-line version. I call it Term-Rex or -rex.
What makes Term-Rex special is that Amazon Q Developer handled approximately 90% of the development work. 
Term-Rex can be installed and played through multiple methods:
Homebrew (macOS/Linux):
brew install jianongHe/tap/term-rex
term-rex

NPM:
npm install -g term-rex
term-rex

Scoop (Windows):
scoop bucket add jianongHe https://github.com/jianongHe/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install term-rex

Download the pre-built binary for your system from the releases page.
Or you can directly clone my repo and go run main.go

Over the past few months, I’ve been actively learning about AI and how to use it effectively. I recently completed the Microsoft Azure AI-900 course, and I must say—the deeper I get into AI, the more curious I become. Lately, I’ve started exploring chatbot development, and I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully deployed my first chatbot!
For someone like me—coming from a non-tech background and getting into the world of AI—this blog is going to be especially helpful. So, stay tuned, as I’ll explain the process of building a chatbot step by step.
I was exploring ways to build a smart assistant that could help automate FAQs and support queries for one of our internal tools. I wanted something:

Managing the state of an activity in real time can be a complex task, especially in applications where updates are frequent. If you are maintaining an Android application where you track activity progress, you might find the need to send and receive partial updates instead of the entire state representation. This is particularly relevant when working with Kotlin data classes, which are generally immutable by default. Let&#x27;s explore a practical approach to efficiently update only specific properties of a Kotlin data class, taking into consideration the challenges of nullability and state management.
Why Updating Data Class Properties is Important

                              <span>Crypto users could be looking for a more sustainable yield this cycle, as total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending continues to hit new highs while decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have lagged in comparison.
DeFi lending protocols are currently the leading DeFi vertical in TVL at $53.6 billion, representing 43% of the $124.6 billion locked across all DeFi protocols. The figure also surpasses liquid staking.
Multichain lending protocol Aave currently holds $25 billion of locked value, accounting for nearly half of the DeFi lending market.

In stark contrast, DEXs, which once held nearly double the TVL of their closest competitor, have dropped from $85.3 billion in November 2021 to $21.5 billion today.

According to police, the incident occurred last November. The victim had finished hosting a crypto-related event in downtown Las Vegas, and when he returned home, the suspects forced him into a vehicle and drove him to a remote desert area an hour away from the city. 
There, they forced him to hand over passwords to his accounts, according to a May 10 report from Las Vegas local news outlet 8 News Now. 
The man was allegedly told to comply with the teens’ demands if he wanted to “live to see another day,” and because they also “had his dad and would kill him,…</span>

“Metaplanet now holds more Bitcoin than El Salvador. From humble beginnings to rivaling nation-states, we’re just getting started,” said CEO Simon Gerovich on X after the latest purchase announcement. 
On May 12, the Tokyo-listed firm announced that it had acquired 1,241 Bitcoin (BTC) for 14.8 million yen ($101,843) per coin.
The total buy, at its highest ever purchase price, is worth around $129 million at current market prices. 
This brings the firm’s total holdings to 6,796 Bitcoin, currently worth around $707 million, and the average purchase price is $91,000 per Bitcoin. Metaplanet started its BTC accumulation strateg…</span>

Bitcoin (BTC) outperformed stocks and held up “incredibly strong” during a sharp sell-off on stock markets in April, following Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs on “Liberation Day,” observed crypto trader “Daan Crypto” on May 11.
Following its plunge to $75,000 on April 7, Bitcoin recovered strongly to trade 27% higher at around $95,000 by the end of the month. Meanwhile, indexes like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq declined in April.

The bill will now head to the 20-member Northern Mariana Islands House, which will need a two-thirds majority vote to override the veto and pass the bill into law.

Stablecoins have been used for various groups to store assets due to a lack of government interference; however, with regulations pending, that could soon change, Ki Young Ju, CEO of crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, said in a May 11 X post.
“Soon, any stablecoin issued by a country could face strict govt regulation, similar to traditional banks. Transfers might automatically trigger tax collection through smart contracts, and wallets could be frozen or require paperwork based on government rules,” he said.
“People who used stablecoins for big international transfers might start looking for censorship-resistant dark stablecoins instead.”

Bitcoin’s potential price reaction to a trade deal between the United States and China could give insights into whether Bitcoin is being used as a safe-haven asset in the current market.

According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company&#x27;s products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

Bitcoin holds on to its recent gains, increasing the possibility of a retest of the all-time high at $109,588.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

Liquidity is tightly clustered around current spot price, with $106,000 the likely next battleground.

Some traders are expecting the bid to enter price discovery to fail.

Bitcoin (BTC) preserved giant gains into the May 11 weekly close as analysis flagged the key level to hold next.

                              <span>Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.
Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.
Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”

Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…</span>

According to data from the El Salvador Bitcoin Office, the country acquired an additional seven BTC in the last seven days, bringing its total holdings to 6,173 BTC, valued at over $637 million.
El Salvador&#x27;s Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases.

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the &quot;loss of chance&quot; claim made against Binance for delisting the token should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages in the original case.
The investors continue to claim that Binance&#x27;s 2019 delisting of BSV and similar major exchange delistings are the primary drivers of BSV&#x27;s long-term price decline and its failure to attract the investor atten…</span>

“Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell,” the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. “Strategy&#x27;s holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders,” Ju continued.
Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, is an outspoken Bitcoin advocate who evangelizes the scarce digital currency to potential investors and has inspired many other companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury plan.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…</span>
