XRP has surged 65% in a month, with technicals pointing to another 45% rally.

Despite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. 
Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. 
Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. 
The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private …</span>

According to a May 14 France24 report, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau has invited crypto professionals to meet him after a brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.
”I will assemble businesspeople working in cryptocurrencies, and we have a few of those in France, at the interior ministry to work with them on their security,” Retailleau reportedly told the Europe 1/CNews broadcaster.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ethereum’s market dominance has hit overbought RSI levels not seen since May 2021, historically followed by major pullbacks.

ETH/USD is showing a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart, hinting at a potential 10–15% price correction.

Despite the near-term risks, some analysts view a pullback as a “buy-the-dip” setup before a possible move toward $3,500–$3,800.

Ether (ETH) has surged over 50% month-to-date in May, vastly outperforming the broader crypto market’s 15.25% gain. The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.
But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate the rally just yet.

Still, some industry observers remain cautious about the likelihood of near-term regulatory change.
“All three major South Korean presidential candidates support #Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment,”  Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of onchain data platform CryptoQuant, wrote in a May 14 X post.
Currently, Bitcoin ETFs and institutional crypto investments are banned in South Korea, meaning that “100% [of the] volume comes from retail,” Ju added.

Fake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.

Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.

The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.

The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.
Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam.

Bitcoin miners have stopped selling their BTC in what may signal the end of a lengthy distribution streak.

Over the past month, miner wallet balances have increased by around 2,700 BTC.

Hash Ribbons data shows good times continuing for both miners and BTC price strength.

Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation by miners is back as network participants swap selling for hodling at $75,000 lows.
Data from onchain analytics firm Glassnode shows that miners are now actively adding to their BTC reserves.
Bitcoin miners buck months of selling
Bitcoin hitting multimonth lows in April sparked a sea change in miner behavior, with a lengthy selling streak reversing into significant accumulation.
Glassnode shows that shortly after BTC/USD bottomed just below $75,000, the balance in miner wallets it…</span>

In a May 13 appearance on the Crypto in America podcast, McHenry revealed that during private meetings with Gensler, the former regulator expressed a far more nuanced view of digital assets.
“Did he come across, or was he as anti-crypto in private as he did in public?” McHenry was asked. His response: “No… Nope.”
McHenry noted that Gensler “saw the value of digital assets” and acknowledged the potential of blockchain technology during his time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.
On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.
Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).

The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. 
But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.

Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use, removing friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability.
“Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said.

World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.
Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.

However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.

Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.
Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.

District Judge William Alsup accepted the plea deals and set a sentencing hearing for Aug. 26. Wire fraud can carry up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines for individuals and $500,00 for businesses.

Synthetix said in a May 14 blog post that it plans to acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million. 
The transaction is subject to approval from both the Synthetix and Derive communities, which will take a vote on the proposal, called SIP-415, next week.
If approved, the acquisition will combine Derive’s front-end and real-world asset (RWA) expertise with Synthetix’s derivatives infrastructure.
Derive originally launched as Lyra in 2021, having spun out from the Synthetix ecosystem. Synthetix said the acquisition is part of a broader strategy that includes…</span>

The Bangkok Post reported on May 13 that Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a briefing after the cabinet endorsed the plan. He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months.
The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.
“One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in go…</span>

A brazen attempt to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, was foiled after the daughter and passersby reportedly fought off the kidnappers.
Three masked men attacked Noizat’s daughter and a male partner on May 13 while she was walking with her son in Paris’ 11th district. The assailants tried to force Noizat’s daughter and her son into a waiting van, the French state-owned media outlet France24 reported on May 13.
The accompanying male partner was assaulted when he tried to intervene, but Noizat’s daughter resisted and managed to take one of the guns off an assailant in a scuffle and throw it away, police said.

                              <span>1. The Problem: A Single Test Environment, Too Many Developers


Every day, developers from multiple squads need access to a shared environment for staging deployments and end‑to‑end tests. Conflicts are routine. People hop into the environment mid‑session or, worse, forget to release it.
Imagine this: Developer A is debugging a flaky integration test. Mid‑way, Developer B deploys a different branch, unaware that the environment is in use. Chaos ensues. Slack threads grow long. Tempers rise. No one&#x27;s to blame, but everyone&#x27;s affected.

This scenario calls for:
A way to reserve the environment
Visibility into who&#x27;s using it
Notifications for the next person in line
This prototype envisions a lean and elegant system:
Developers click to join the queue
When their turn comes, they get notified…</span>

In this post, we explore the ISC License, a permissive open source license renowned for its clarity and minimal legal overhead. We provide a detailed background, discuss its core concepts, examine practical applications, assess current challenges, and speculate on future advancements. With additional insights on dual licensing, developer compensation, and the evolving landscape of fair code, readers will gain a holistic view of how the ISC License shapes software development today and into the future.
Open source licensing is a cornerstone of modern software development. Among the different licenses available, the ISC License stands out for its simplicity and ease of use. Originating from the Internet Software Consortium, it offers a permissive legal framework that encourages in…</span>

  Введение


Кибератаки становятся все более частыми и изощренными, угрожая организациям по всему миру. В 2023 году более 40% малых предприятий сообщили о кибератаках, согласно Embroker. Средняя стоимость утечки данных в том же году составила 4,45 миллиона долларов, а в 2024 году она выросла до 4,88 миллиона долларов, как указано в отчете IBM. Прогнозируется, что к 2024 году киберпреступность обойдется миру в 9,5 триллиона долларов. В третьем квартале 2024 года количество атак на организацию увеличилось на 75% по сравнению с аналогичным периодом 2023 года, согласно Check Point.

“Which tech stack should I learn?”
“Should I use Next.js or Svelte?”
“Is Python better for the backend than node?”
I am sure we have asked or been asked questions like this several times in our tech journeys. As someone who is just starting out, I think it seems like a very important thing to ask. You don’t wanna waste your time learning a technology that might become worthless soon? Or isn’t fast enough? or isn’t the “industry standard”… right?
Or should it matter?
Back in 2003 when Facebook was originally founded, its backend was written in PHP. Was it the lack of options? You can say so. Back then they certainly didn’t have a plethora of frameworks or hell even languages to choose from. But what about now? Realistically PHP should be dead by now…
Right?

                              <span>Dreams actually reflect our underlying mental state.
I remember before switching jobs and moving to Japan for the first time, I often had dreams where I was flying freely through the city — a sense of freedom and being completely unrestrained. But in the past few years, due to constant exhaustion and lack of sleep, I rarely dream anymore, or if I do, I forget them shortly after waking up.
The intense mental focus required at work, especially when dealing with code and problem-solving under pressure, has also led to a noticeable increase in nightmares compared to before.
Our physical condition has a significant impact on our mental state. And when mental strain leads to insomnia, it can further affect our physical health. In short, it’s important to take care of both our physical and mental well-being.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Joining tables in SQL typically involves matching rows based on one or more keys. However, when dealing with composite keys—where two or more columns uniquely identify a row— it can become trickier. In this article, we will work through the process of joining two tables, Income_o and Outcome_o, that use composite keys (point and date), and how to achieve the desired result set.
Why Join Tables by Composite Keys?
Using composite keys in database design allows for more flexibility and precision in data organization, especially when single-column keys cannot uniquely identify records. In our case, both Income_o and Outcome_o tables have composite keys where each combination of point and date plays a crucial role in successfully joining the tables to analyze income and outcome dat…</span>

In this article, we’ll:

Play out Terminator-themed scenarios to reinforce the concepts




Step 1: Creating Test User Accounts
Step 2: Meet usermod – The Cyberdyne Identity Shifter

docker images

🟢 Step 4: Run Container from Image
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-python-app iamnk007/python-sample-app-demo:v1
# -d &#x3D; detached mode
# -p &#x3D; port mapping (host:container)
# --name &#x3D; custom container name

or you can run below command as well just make sure you are mentioning port in dockerfile
docker run -it iamnk007/python-sample-app-demo

🟢 Step 5: Check Running Containers
docker ps

🟢 Step 6: Access Application in Browser
Open: http://localhost:5000
