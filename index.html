                              <span>⚛️ What is React?
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Helps create interactive, reusable UI components
Ideal for Single Page Applications (SPAs)
Powered by Virtual DOM for faster performance
✅ Why Use React?
🔁 Component-Based – Reusable UI blocks &#x3D; less code, better structure
⚡ Fast Rendering – Uses Virtual DOM to update only the changed parts.
📍Where and When to Use React?
A dynamic front-end (like a dashboard, social media, e-commerce site)
A SPA (Single Page Application) for fast user interactions
Reusable components like buttons, modals, forms, cards, etc.
Integration with other libraries like Redux, React Router, etc.
React is used in:
Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp Web
Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, and more!
🌟 Advantages of React
✅ Reusability of components
✅ Improved performance with Virtual DOM
✅ Strong community and third-party support
✅ Easier debugging with tools like React DevTools
✅ Flexibility with different backend frameworks
⚠️ Disadvantages of React
❌ Fast-changing environment – frequent updates and breaking changes
❌ SEO can be tricky in SPAs (Next.js solves this)
❌ Too many choices (state management, routing, etc.)

                              <span>I’m a firm believer in lifelong learning, especially in a field as dynamic as Artificial Intelligence. So, when I heard about the Advanced LLM Agents MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) offered by UC Berkeley, featuring lectures from leading researchers, I knew I had to dive in. The promise of learning from the architects of tomorrow&#x27;s AI, like Prof. Dawn Song and a host of industry pioneers, was too good to pass up. You can explore the course yourself – the content is publicly available: https://llmagents-learning.org/sp25.
One lecture that particularly resonated with me was &quot;Learning to Self-Improve &amp; Reason with LLMs&quot; by Jason Weston of Meta &amp; NYU. His presentation was a deep dive into the cutting edge of making LLMs smarter and more capable. Here are my top 7 takeaways from his insightfu…</span>

                              <span>So this guy — Kenn White — who’s apparently worked with PlayStation, Amazon, and all that, jumped into my comment thread on LinkedIn to basically try and school me about AI-generated mobile games.
I had said something simple:
Games on Mistplay and other mobile platforms are already being built using AI tools — low-rated ones, fast clones, reward-based apps. They&#x27;re everywhere. You just don’t hear about them because no one brags about them. But they make money.
Kenn decided to jump in and throw his status around, asking for proof, acting like that kind of thing doesn’t happen.
I responded calmly, explaining how I’ve been building AI-assisted systems myself, integrating Firebase, procedural logic, and even using Unity just to output animations — but doing the actual gameplay engine in JavaScript for speed and performance.
And what happened next?
He blocked me.
Here&#x27;s his page if you&#x27;re curious who got cooked:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennwhite/
What’s Funny About It
They’re not fancy. They just work.
And I’m trying to build the same kind of systems, just with my style, my identity.


TL;DR
Might turn the whole thing into a dev.to series on indie game engines and procedural mobile development with Firebase + JS.

A database is basically an organised collection of data that is structured and electronically stored in a computer system. 
  Postgresql 
  Microsoft SQL server
  Mysql
  Sqlite
Sql is the key cornerstone for the above relational databases. 
  A smooth integration with other programming languages such as python, R. 
  Data integrity. 
  Reliability.
  A proven architecture.
  Safely stores and scales the most complicated data workloads. 
Psycopg2 is the most popular Postgresql database adapter for python. 
In this article I am using python in a container environment.  Open the command prompt and type; 
conda install -c anaconda psycopg2

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;m Gaurang. I’ve worked extensively with Node.js in the past, and during that time, I spent a lot of effort wrangling with different async patterns — callbacks, promises, and async/await. This article is part of my series, My guide to getting through the maze of callbacks, promises, and async-await, where I share lessons learned and best practices for writing asynchronous code in Node.js.
This article assumes you’re familiar with basic Node.js concepts, especially asynchronous programming constructs like callbacks, promises, and async/await.
Converting a Promise-based Function to Use Callbacks
Prefer Then-chaining over nesting
Often, you’ll find yourself working in older codebases where asynchronous functions are written using the callback pattern. Node.js also offers a built-in way t…</span>

                              <span>When we talk about lazy loading, most developers think of one thing:


It’s an awesome performance win — only load images when they&#x27;re needed.
There’s a whole world of assets, components, and even logic that you can delay to give users a faster, smoother experience.
Let’s dig in. 👇
Modern bundlers like Webpack, Vite, and Rollup support dynamic import() for splitting your JS into chunks and loading them on demand.
button.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, async () &#x3D;&gt; {
  const { showModal } &#x3D; await import(&quot;./modal.js&quot;);
  showModal();
});

✅ Benefits:
Smaller initial bundle
Faster initial load
Only load what the user interacts with
Yes — you can lazy load styles too.

                              <span>Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about technical meetings.

You know — those syncs, standups, grooming sessions, “quick” clarifications, architecture overviews, retro deep-dives, async that turns into sync, and everything in between.
How many of them do we really need?
I say this as someone who enjoys teamwork — but I’m starting to believe we’re seriously overdoing it.
A “quick call” often turns into a 30–45 minute rabbit hole.
Meetings interrupt deep focus. Even a 15-minute sync at 11:30 AM can ruin an entire productive morning.
Half the time, the same question could be resolved in 3 Slack messages or a Loom video.
The more people in the call — the less productive it usually is.
And most importantly:
More meetings ≠ more alignment.

Often, they’re a symptom of unclear specs, weak async culture, or trust issues.
Here’s what has worked for me (and the teams I’ve led):
Write clearer tickets. Record short Loom videos. Share architecture ideas in Notion or GitHub Issues.
Not every engineer, PM, and designer needs to be in every call.
Ask: “Can this be a doc?” → If yes, make a doc.

Ask: “Do I really need live feedback?” → If not, write it up.
When developers are trusted to make technical decisions and document them, calls become rare and more impactful.
Don’t get me wrong — I’ve had great technical calls.

Collaborative design sessions, real-time debugging, or architecture whiteboarding can be amazing. But they should be the exception — not the default.
If you&#x27;re in meetings all day and wondering why you&#x27;re shipping less — this might be your answer.
How many technical calls do you have each week?
How many of them could be async?
What helps your team reduce meeting overload?

  🎯 Introduction


API testing in Playwright focuses on directly interacting with web applications at the API level, aiming to validate the functionality, reliability, efficiency, and security of RESTful services and endpoints! 🚀 Unlike traditional browser-based tests, API testing with Playwright involves sending HTTP requests to the API and examining the responses, without rendering the graphical interface. This method provides a fast, efficient way to identify issues early in the development cycle, ensuring APIs adhere to their specifications and correctly integrate with front-end components and other services.
🎯 Why API Testing?: API tests are faster, more reliable, and provide better coverage than UI tes…</span>
