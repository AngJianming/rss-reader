                              <span>Generative Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captivated the world, evolving from novel curiosities to powerful tools capable of producing text, images, and code in response to human prompts. However, the frontier of AI is already pushing beyond these prompt-response paradigms. The next significant leap is the rise of autonomous AI agents: sophisticated systems that can understand goals, devise plans, execute multi-step tasks, and even self-correct to achieve objectives with minimal human intervention. These agents represent a paradigm shift, moving from AI that responds to AI that acts and achieves.
At its core, an AI agent leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as its cognitive engine. But unlike a simple chatbot interaction, an agent integrates this LLM with several crucial components:…</span>

                              <span>Access control is the backbone of secure smart contract design.
Whether you’re building a DeFi protocol, NFT minting contract, or on-chain governance system — you need to control who can do what.
But too often, developers default to a single onlyOwner check and call it a day. That might work for simple prototypes — but in production systems, it’s dangerous, inflexible, and often unsustainable.
In this guide, we’ll walk through the most important access control patterns in Solidity, their use cases, trade-offs, and how to do it right.
** The Foundations: onlyOwner and Ownable**
OpenZeppelin’s Ownable contract is the simplest form of access control:
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner;

You define an owner, and functions are restricted via the onlyOwner modifier.

I get it; new tech can feel overwhelming. But after exploring it myself, I think it’s pretty useful. Let’s break it down in a clear, straightforward way, like we’re chatting over coffee.

You: Okay, I keep hearing about SharePoint Embedded, but what the heck is it? Another SharePoint Online clone?
Me: Nah, it’s not a clone. Think of SharePoint Embedded as a way for developers to plug document management right into their own apps. It’s API-based, lives in your Microsoft 365 tenant, and keeps things secure. Plus, it plays nice with Microsoft Purview for compliance and lets you collaborate on Word, Excel, or PowerPoint files in real time with Office Web Apps. It’s less …</span>

We&#x27;ve found that a comprehensive network performance measurement definition encompasses multiple metrics including bandwidth usage, packet loss, efficiency, and availability. Active network performance measurement allows us to distinguish between application problems and data transmission issues, leading to more precise problem detection. 
In this article, we&#x27;ll explore why uptime alone is insufficient for modern networks, identify the key metrics you should be monitoring, and demonstrate how real-time monitoring tools can prevent service…</span>

grep?


grep stands for Global Regular Expression Print. It searches for patterns in input text files or streams and prints matching lines.
Whether you’re analyzing logs or searching for specific code usage, grep is a lightning-fast and powerful utility.
grep Usage


Here are the most commonly used basic options:
grep &quot;pattern&quot; file.txt

原文附圖：https://blog.kueiapp.com/programming-tw/mapping-macbook-jis-keyboard-keys-to-another-by-hammerspoon-on-macos/
若購買的是 JIS 日文鍵盤配置的 MacBook，你會發現不論是自已安裝別的中文輸入法或mac內建的中文輸入法，切換英文輸入時，英文字母以外的按鍵位置都會跑掉，尤其是各種符號鍵。這時只要使用「UK – British」，幾乎所有的按鍵位置就會跟 US配置一樣，除了「3#」。
Hammerspoon是一個超強的程式工具，能修改轉換很多 macOS 的功能。因為不論是用日文輸入法或中文輸入法，在 US/UK 的配置中，點選 shift 或 capslock 就可以直接在中英文輸入法之間切換，但日本人好像不知道因而特別在空白鍵設計「英数」與「かな」兩顆按鍵，對我來說反而超容易誤按。
使用 Hammerspoon 自行撰寫簡單的小程式 Lua script ，將 MacBook JIS 鍵盤上特殊的「英數」鍵（Eisu）和「かな」鍵（Kana）重新映射為空白鍵。以下是詳細的設定步驟：
安裝後要先確定兩件事，

由於要轉換鍵盤按鍵，所以要在 macOS System Settings 中啟用 Accessibility，


Hammerspoon Preferences中要改用 Launch at login 才會在下一次的登入重開機時自動套用設定




  
  
  1. 確認按鍵代碼


Hammerspoon啟動後，可以在  macOS 右上角的 menu 中看到它，下圖是它的選單。要編寫 script 程式碼時要選 Open Config，它會自動開啟~/.hammerspoon/init.lua 文件，每一次修改儲存後都要再點一次 Reload Config 才會套用，要 debug 查看時請點 Console 開啟控制台視窗。
在 Hammerspoon 中，您可以使用以下 Lua script 來監控按鍵事件，從而獲取「英數」和「かな」鍵的 keyCode：先測試一下自已的 電腦按鍵是幾號，例如我的英數鍵為102，かな鍵為104。
hs.eventtap.new({hs.eventtap.event.types.keyDown}, function(event)
  print(&quot;Key code:&quot;, event:getKeyCode())
  return false
end):start()

使用以下 Lua script 將這兩個鍵通通映射為空白鍵
remap &#x3D; hs.eventtap.new({hs.eventtap.event.types.keyDown}, function(event)
  local keyCode &#x3D; event:getKeyCode()
  if keyCode &#x3D;&#x3D; 102 then  -- 英數鍵
    hs.eventtap.keyStroke({}, &quot;space&quot;)
    return true
  elseif keyCode &#x3D;&#x3D; 104 then  -- かな鍵
    hs.eventtap.keyStroke({}, &quot;space&quot;)
    return true
  end
  return false
end)

remap:start()

                              <span>The Hongmeng AppStartup framework makes the application startup process more efficient and controllable through task orchestration and dependency management.This article analyzes the core mechanism, configuration points and practical cases to help you optimize startup performance~
Sorting: Ensure the order of task execution through dependency chains (such as initializing the database first and then loading the network)
Parallelity: Supports parallel execution of dependency-free tasks to reduce total time-consuming
Configurable: Dynamically manage tasks through JSON files without modifying code
