If we were granted a pizza party by the teacher, it was for something phenomenal that we had achieved... 100% participation in some special activity, or excellence on a particular  test... in some more rowdy classes, it was just because everyone behaved appropriately for the same couple of days in a week 🤣!!!

Back at the beginning of my career, I experienced a parallel - the catered lunch.  I was on a team with a pretty specific focus on app support; we had a workload of tickets and that was how we received all of our work.  It was a pretty overwhelming workload - a half-dozen of us had to manage a hundred tickets per day, triaging anything from automated system monitor alerts all the way to diagn…</span>

                              <span>Remote Management is a feature that allows administrators or third-party tools to control a Mac remotely — from installing apps to changing settings. It’s powerful and useful in corporate settings, but if you&#x27;re a personal user and didn’t set it up, it could be a serious security red flag.
In this guide, you&#x27;ll learn:
What Remote Management is
How it differs from Screen Sharing 
What it can do
How to check if it’s enabled
And how to disable it (safely)
Remote Management allows someone to control your Mac over a network. It uses Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) — Apple&#x27;s admin tool — to let IT professionals perform tasks like:
Access files or screens
Install or remove software
Manage settings and users
Send system commands
It’s usually seen in business environments or schools. If you&#x27;re not in ei…</span>

                              <span>The modern software development landscape is a vibrant tapestry of technologies. As developers in 2025, we often find ourselves working on projects that demand a mix of programming languages, frameworks, and databases – a practice known as polyglot programming. One project might be a robust PHP backend with MySQL, another a snappy Node.js microservice hitting MongoDB, and perhaps a Python script for data analysis talking to PostgreSQL. This diversity is exciting, allowing us to pick the best tool for each job.
But let&#x27;s be honest: while developing on a sleek macOS machine is a joy, managing this symphony of different local development environments can often feel less like a paradise and more like a tangled mess of version conflicts, PATH variable nightmares, and port clashes. That is, unti…</span>

They waste time using ineffective methods that still end in a fail score. I used to be one of them.
But there’s a quick and simple way that guarantees results and helps you to stop overthinking everything. Over the past few years, I’ve studied for multiple exams using this method and passed every time on my first attempt.
Each time I walked into the exam room, there was never a doubt in my mind that I could fail.
I’m currently studying for the AWS Solutions Architect and I’ve been using this method which I’m confident will yield results.
If you’re struggling with exam prep, consider following these 9 steps.
Pick a video learning platform that has a course for the exam you’re studying for.

It actually happened.
Today, we’re celebrating one of the most legendary stories in Bitcoin history a story that reminds us how far we’ve come, how wild the ride has been, and why this quirky industry continues to capture imaginations.
Let’s break it down storytime style.
🕰️ Flashback to May 22, 2010
Laszlo Hanyecz posted on the BitcoinTalk forum:
“I&#x27;ll pay 10,000 Bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.”
Yes, that’s right. 10,000 BTC.
Soon after, someone delivered two Papa John’s pizzas to his doorstep, and history was made. At the time, those coins were worth around $41.
$1,100,000,000

Like many people, I&#x27;ve picked up too many subscriptions, some through Apple (iCloud, Apple Music), others got lost in random platforms (like Netflix, which I forgot I was still paying for). I actually used Apple Music regularly (and previously Spotify), but the streaming turned out to be more convenience than necessity. With a curated local library, I didn&#x27;t lose much, just the lock-in.
Initially I thought, I&#x27;d just keep using iCloud Music Library for cross-device music synchronization, but once I cancelled the Apple Music subscription, the sync stopp…</span>

However, these tools have one major limitation: building anything beyond a simple landing page usually requires a robust backend. You might suggest integrating Supabase, but it&#x27;s primarily a database abstraction layer around PostgreSQL, not a standalone backend. Supabase often falls short when scaling complex, high-performance products.
If you&#x27;re creating a service that needs high scalability, robust security, or something beyond web (like mobile apps, desktop apps, or performance-critical solutions), you need a proper backend.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with domain-specific or real-time information. By coupling an LLM with a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information from a knowledge base, RAG significantly mitigates issues like hallucination (generating factually incorrect information) and the inability to access current or proprietary data. This approach grounds LLM responses in verifiable sources, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs.
Despite its advantages, building effective RAG applications presents its own set of challenges. These include ensuring the retrieved information is highly relevant to the user&#x27;s query, guaranteeing the LLM&#x27;s generated response faithfully adheres to the retrieved context, and m…</span>

As a developer building or maintaining platforms that support trading infrastructure, it’s essential to understand the mechanics of HFT, its influence, and how major exchanges support it through market maker programs.
High-frequency trading refers to algorithm-driven trading strategies that execute a large volume of transactions in milliseconds. These systems exploit minor price discrepancies across exchanges or within a single order book to generate profit.
Key characteristics of HFT include:

Discord user: “Was the AGPL‑3.0 license intentional? I think that means it couldn’t be used in a closed‑source app.”
When Replyke v5 launched a couple of days ago, it shipped under a single AGPL‑3.0 license - for both the server and the client packages. A day later, this question came in through Discord. It raised a valid point and prompted a closer look at whether the licensing setup aligned with how developers would actually use the framework.

Millennials and Gen X (aged 25–54) dominate the investor base, comprising 71% of all holders. Among those trading at least once a week, 76% fall into this age group.

                              <span>The market cap of the world’s first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, surpassed that of retail and tech behemoth Amazon on “Bitcoin Pizza Day.”
Market data shows that Bitcoin (BTC) had a market cap of $2.205 trillion at the time of writing, $70 billion more than the $2.135 trillion Amazon valuation.
“By surpassing Amazon in terms of capitalization, Bitcoin has attracted even more attention from the non-crypto audience,” said Alex Obchakevich, founder of Obchakevich Research. 
Obchakevich said the latest rally “will strengthen confidence in Bitcoin and lead to new injections into the crypto market.” The surge came as Bitcoin set a new all-time high and traded above $110,000, which Obchavich said will “attract new investors to large funds.”

ChatGPT-powered AI agents automate trading tasks using natural language prompts and API integrations, improving speed and consistency.

Successes occur when ChatGPT is used as a support tool, not a fully autonomous trading system.

Failures happen when traders over-rely on ChatGPT without real-time data, proper risk management or manual oversight.

Regulatory focus on AI in trading is increasing, with new frameworks emerging to ensure transparency, accountability and compliance.

What if a crypto trader didn’t need to constantly check charts, worry about emotions, or stay up all night watching for sudden price swings? What if those tasks could be handled by an intelligent agent that understands instructions in plain English — and reacts within milliseconds? That’s where Chat…</span>

Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.

On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. 
Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”

                              <span>What is shilling in crypto?            
            
                
At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

                              <span>The hacker behind the data breach targeting Coinbase users mocked blockchain investigator ZachXBT with an onchain message following a major crypto swap.
On May 21, the hacker used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” followed by a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar.
The message came after the attacker swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. 
ZachXBT flagged the message on his Telegram channel, linking it to the same entity responsible for the Coinbase data breach affecting at least 69,400 users.

                              <span>Tech giant Microsoft says it has taken legal action against the information-stealing malware Lumma Stealer and has blocked thousands of websites related to the software.
Microsoft said in a May 21 blog post that a federal court in Georgia allowed the firm’s digital crimes unit to take down, block or suspend nearly 2,300 websites critical to Lumma’s operations, and it has collaborated with local and international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the project’s infrastructure.
The company said the US Department of Justice seized Lumma’s central command structure and disrupted marketplaces where the tool was sold to other cybercriminals. 
Microsoft says that Lumma has been sold via underground forums since 2022 and that it has undergone multiple upgrades since its launch.

The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV.
Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry.
“With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $110,788.98 on Coinbase late on May 21, just before 11:30 pm UTC, according to TradingView.
Bitcoin has gained around 3% over the last 24 hours, surpassing its all-time high of $109,458 that it hit earlier in the day, which was the first time it traded above its previously long-held Jan. 20 peak.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency has now gained 17.5% so far this year and is up 47% since its slump to $75,000 on April 7, triggered by US President Donald Trump enacting sweeping tariffs that tanked global markets.

                              <span>Crypto influencer Anthony Pompliano’s fintech-focused blank-check company, ProCap Acquisition Corp (PCAPU), rose 7% on its debut Nasdaq listing after a last-minute upsizing of its initial public offering.
ProCap had boosted its IPO from $200 million to $220 million on May 20, a day before its public launch, pricing its 22 million shares on offer at $10 each.
ProCap shares closed the May 21 trading day up 7% at $10.70, which continued with a 1.6% bump after-hours to $10.87, Yahoo Finance data shows.

                              <span>Kristin Johnson of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced that she plans to depart the agency before 2026.
In a May 21 notice, Johnson said she planned to step down from the CFTC “later this year,” having completed her term, which ended in April. The commissioner filling a Democratic seat at the financial regulator had served since March 2022 after being nominated by former President Joe Biden.
In her farewell message, Johnson cited her work as a sponsor of the Market Risk Advisory Committee, which dealt with “nascent issues that arise with the introduction of decentralized financial products such as digital assets or cryptocurrency and other emerging markets.”

According to the announcement, Solana Mobile will ship the device starting Aug. 4. Seeker is the company’s second-generation device, after the Saga Web3 phone that launched in April 2023. 
The company unveiled the Seeker phone in September 2024, saying it wouldn’t just be a “memecoin phone.” So far, it has pre-sold 150,000 units.
The Solana Seeker has gone through two sale phases: The Founder window, where the price for each device was $450, and the Early Adopter window, where the price per device was $500.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.
