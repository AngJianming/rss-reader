                              <span>Understanding the journey of data is very useful. One common way to exchange information is through JSON files, a lightweight format widely used, for example, in NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
In Python, there are some important functions to work with JSON data:
json.dump(obj, file): Saves a Python object obj to a .json file.


json.dumps(obj): Converts a Python object obj into a JSON string (without creating a file).


json.load(file): Reads a .json file and converts its contents into a Python object.


json.loads(string): Converts a JSON string into a Python object.
&#x60;python
data &#x3D; {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Guisell&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;backend learner&quot;}
json_str &#x3D; json.dumps(data)
with open(&quot;data.json&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) as f:
parsed_data &#x3D; json.loads(json_str)
JSON is an essential format for data exchange, especially when working with APIs and databases. Knowing these functions helps you efficiently read and write JSON data in Python.

As AI continues to evolve, mastering how we prompt and guide language models has become just as important as the models themselves. This chapter explores cutting-edge prompting strategies and vector-based text representations that significantly enhance the capabilities of modern AI systems.
From adjusting randomness with temperature and top-P sampling to guiding AI thought processes with techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and ReAct prompting, we unlock ways to improve both the creativity and reliability of AI-generated responses. You&#x27;ll also discover how embeddings and cosine similarity allow us to quantify meaning and relevance between pieces of text laying the groundwork for powerful applications in search, recommendation, and question-answering systems.

You might already know (or do) most of what’s in this post — and that’s great.
Think of this as a quick reference, not a rulebook. Use it to reflect, refine, or share with your team.
In modern software development, there&#x27;s a library for almost everything:
Debouncing, date formatting, data validation, API calls, routing, state management, database queries, caching, logging...
And that abundance creates a common habit:
“Found a library? Just install it.”
But every npm install does more than just add functionality.

It introduces:
More bundle size

More maintenance overhead

More potential security risks

And less control over your system
So let’s break down the benefits of using fewer libraries — and more importantly, when it actually makes sense to avoid or inclu…</span>

                              <span>Hello AI enthusiasts! 👋
Just starting to learn about AI Agents.My approach will be to lean heavily on openly available resources, which I&#x27;ll share as I discover them.
This weekend was dedicated to absorbing knowledge from OpenAI&#x27;s A Practical Guide to Building Agents and Anthropic&#x27;s insightful blog post Building Effective Agents. The visual representation in Anthropic&#x27;s piece was particularly helpful in grasping the end-to-end process.
One initial thought that keeps popping into my head, perhaps influenced by my background, is how the asynchronous nature of agent operations seems to align really well with Node.js&#x27;s event-driven model and its built-in EventEmitter. Could this be a key runtime for agent development?
I&#x27;ll investigate this further as I progress.
If you&#x27;re also learning about AI Agents, comment below. Let&#x27;s learn together.
Any advice or resources from those who&#x27;ve already learned this? Please share!
I&#x27;ll do my best to keep these updates coming, but life happens! 
Thanks for being a part of my learning journey.</span>

Not because the code is hard. Because the data isn’t there.
You want to simulate a CRM. Or invoice syncing. Or product catalog APIs. And all you’ve got is the Swagger Pet Store. (Seriously—why is that still the default?)
That’s exactly the frustration that led us to create apiexplorer.io: a completely free API playground built for developers who need realistic business APIs—not toy endpoints.
The Problem with Traditional “Demo” APIs


There are plenty of public APIs out there. JSONPlaceholder is a classic. ReqRes is nice. Stripe and Shopify offer sandboxes if you’re willing to sign up and wade through auth flows.

                              <span>Coinbase and two executives have been hit with another proposed class-action lawsuit over the crypto exchange’s stock price drop after disclosing a user data breach earlier this month and for allegedly failing to disclose a violation of an agreement with a UK regulator.
Coinbase investor Brady Nessler said in a May 22 lawsuit filed in a Pennsylvania federal court that the data breach and the alleged broken agreement with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority resulted in a “precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares,” causing stockholders to suffer “significant losses and damages.”
Coinbase said on May 15 that its damages bill could run up to $400 million after it was hit with a $20 million extortion attempt four days earlier, with several of its customer support …</span>

                              <span>Blockstream CEO Adam Back has led a 21 million Swedish krona ($2.2 million) funding round in the Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB, which last week said it would start buying Bitcoin.
H100 said on May 25 that the funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, will be used to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) in line with its Bitcoin-buying pivot announced on May 22.
Back, a longtime Bitcoin cypherpunk, contributed around $1.4 million, while the remaining $800,000 came from investment firms Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB and Crafoord Capital Partners.
The raise would allow H100 to buy around 20.18 Bitcoin at current market prices, which would add to the 4.39 Bitcoin that it purchased on May 22 and bring its total stash to roughly 24.57 Bitcoin.

According to the report, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MSB) check, allowing them to manipulate the values for the liquidity parameters by orders of magnitude and establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. The Dedaub security researchers wrote:
&quot;This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens.&quot;

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Cardone Capital founder and CEO Grant Cardone said the Miami River Bitcoin Fund, which is the firm&#x27;s fourth blended investment vehicle mixing BTC and commercial multifamily real estate, will convert a portion of its monthly cash flows to BTC.
Cardone told Cointelegraph the impetus to start the fund followed a suggestion from his brother. The CEO said:

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.

Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not despite worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.

Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.
Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin price is stuck below $109,588, but the pullback has not altered its bullish chart structure.

A bullish weekly open from Bitcoin could extend gains in HYPE, XMR, AAVE, and WLD.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck below the $109,588 level during a quiet weekend, but analysts remain bullish. Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan said in a post on X that Bitcoin remains positive as long as it trades above the yearly open level of about $93,500. 
Bitcoin’s demand is likely to remain strong with investments from sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds, publicly listed companies and select nations. Crypto index fund management firm Bitwise said in a recent report that institutional funds could pump roughly $120 billion into Bitcoin in 2025 and about $300 billion in 2026.

&quot;I only buy Bitcoin with money I can&#x27;t afford to lose,&quot; Saylor wrote to his 4.3 million followers in an X post.
The company&#x27;s most recent purchase of 7,390 BTC on May 19, valued at nearly $765 million, brought Strategy&#x27;s total holdings to 576,230 BTC.
If Strategy completes the acquisition on May 26, it will mark the company&#x27;s seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin purchases.

During Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.
Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today&#x27;s tran…</span>

                              <span>AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.
Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.
It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.
That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.

Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.
At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.

In January 2021, Solana broke out from a prolonged consolidation phase just as marketwide interest began accelerating. 
The breakout, highlighted by a decisive flip above key Fibonacci retracement levels, triggered a vertical rally that saw SOL jump to the 4.618 Fib retracement line around $19 from roughly $4.90 in under two months, marking a 291% surge.

The move is part of a broader digital transformation plan spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council and backed by the Ministry of Finance, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel.
In the first phase, the government plans to channel excess power into AI infrastructure and crypto mining operations. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the decision is expected to attract billions in foreign investment while generating high-tech employment across the country.
The initiative’s second phase will introduce access to renewable energy for mining operations, aiming to balance growth with environmental responsibility.

                              <span>A Manhattan crypto investor is facing serious charges after allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian man in a disturbing bid to extract access to digital assets.
John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court following his arrest on Friday. He stands accused of holding a 28-year-old Italian man captive for weeks inside a luxury townhouse in Soho, reportedly rented for $30,000 per month.
According to police reports cited by The New York Times, the victim arrived in the US on May 6 and was allegedly abducted by Woeltz and an accomplice.
The attackers are said to have stolen the man’s passport and electronic devices before demanding the password to his Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. When he refused, the suspects allegedly subjected him to prolonged physical abuse.

“You can’t eat Bitcoin,” Rennick said in a May 23 X post, responding to an X user who questioned his stance after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.
Rennick says Bitcoin will go to $1 million but is a “Ponzi Scheme”
“Bitcoin will ultimately go to $1 million dollars. Why because it’s a Ponzi scheme whereby BlackRock will pump more and more dollars into a supply constrained product,” Rennick said.
“What exactly will this product produce?” Rennick said. He added that Bitcoin (BTC) will produce “absolutely nothing” and Australia “needs real engineers not financial engineers.…</span>

                              <span>ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood says crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will likely maintain their place in the economy, regardless of how widespread crypto wallet adoption becomes over the next decade.
“I think ETFs are an important stepping stone because, you know, wallets seem so complicated, so much friction for consumers, they just wanna push a button,” Wood said at the Solana Accelerate event in New York on May 23.
Wallets remain an insurance policy, says Wood
“So ETFs for those who want the convenience, I don’t think, will lose a lot of their luster,” she said. “But they will be a stepping stone into wallet-based.” Wood reiterated the extra layer of protection that crypto wallets provide:
“These are insurance policies against something going wrong in the traditional world.”

                              <span>Scammers posing as Ledger, a hardware wallet manufacturer, are sending physical letters to crypto users instructing them to &quot;validate&quot; their wallets or risk losing access to funds, in the latest phishing attack to impact the industry.
BitGo CEO Mike Belshe shared a picture of the scam letter, which featured a QR code, presumably linked to a malicious phishing site. The letter was sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS), according to the executive.
&quot;These are all scams do not fall for any of these,&quot; Troy Lindsey wrote after receiving a copy of the phishing letter.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have already surpassed gold ETFs in early growth, with projections of $100 billion in annual inflows by 2027.

Publicly listed companies and nation-states currently hold nearly 1.7 million BTC, pointing to long-term confidence.

Bitwise projects $120 billion in Bitcoin inflows by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) demand from a diverse range of investors—including publicly listed companies building Bitcoin treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and nation-states—is projected to drive substantial capital inflows to the asset in the coming years. According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.

In the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn&#x27;t just power — it&#x27;s a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra&#x27;s OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.
Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.
Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might …</span>

“This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace.

According to US law, the presidential seal cannot be used in any manner that could imply government approval or sponsorship. Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.

“Bitcoin Treasury Companies will hold 50% of all BTC, way more than most Bitcoiners are prepared for,” Jesse Myers said in a May 23 X thread.
Strategy will own $70T of Bitcoin by 2025, says Myers
Myers further forecasted that Michael Saylor’s Strategy will own $70 trillion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) by 2045, “making it by far the most valuable company in the history of the world.” At the time of publication, Strategy holds 576,320 Bitcoin, worth approximately $62.24 billion, according to Saylor Tracker.

                              <span>A US federal judge has vacated key fraud and manipulation convictions against Avraham Eisenberg, the trader at the center of the case involving a $110 million exploit of the decentralized exchange Mango Markets.
On Friday, US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the evidence presented at trial failed to support the jury’s conclusion that Eisenberg made materially false representations to Mango Markets.
The decision vacates Eisenberg’s convictions for commodities fraud and market manipulation and acquits him of a third charge, significantly weakening the government’s case.
Eisenberg, a self-proclaimed “applied game theorist,” was convicted in 2024 for artificially inflating the price of Mango’s MNGO token by over 1,300% in a matter of minutes and using the resulting gains as collatera…</span>

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF continues inflow streak
On May 23, the final day of the trading week, spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs recorded $211.7 million in inflows. However, BlackRock’s IBIT was the only fund to post gains in the trading day, adding $430.8 million and extending its inflow streak to eight consecutive days.
Grayscale’s GBTC led outflows with $89.2 million, followed by ARK 21Shares’ ARKB with $73.9 million.

His resignation drew reactions across Polygon and the wider crypto community, with several seeing it as a loss for Polygon, which has been tied to several major developments in recent months.
Bjelic winds down ‘day-to-day involvement’
“After much thought and reflection, I’ve decided to step down from the board of the Polygon Foundation and wind down my day-to-day involvement with Polygon Labs,” Bjelic said in a May 23 X post.
“I’ll always be cheering from the sidelines and supporting however and whenever I can,” Bjelic added.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin bulls aim to push BTC above $110,000 by May 30 to capitalize on $4.8 billion in call options.

Spot BTC ETF inflows and weak put positioning give bulls a strong edge in the monthly expiry.

Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching its largest monthly options expiry of 2025, with total exposure reaching $13.8 billion. This event gives bulls a chance to secure Bitcoin’s price above $110,000, as bears were caught off guard by a 25% rally over the past 30 days.

The open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.
