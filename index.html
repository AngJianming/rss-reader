                              <span>Key Takeaways:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

                              <span>Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXC
Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it&#x27;s subtler and more challenging to detect.
What&#x27;s more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

                              <span>Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said &quot;teachers are going the extra mile for their students&#x27; education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms.&quot; The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

US President Donald Trump will host a gala dinner for top holders of his Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin despite bipartisan criticism and renewed calls for impeachment.
In a May 5 Truth Social post, Trump announced that he will hold a gala dinner with major TRUMP holders on May 22. The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.
In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.

                              <span>Michael Saylor’s Strategy, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin investors, slowed its BTC purchases last week as the cryptocurrency briefly surged above $97,000.
Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

The latest buy is 87% less than the previous purchase of 15,355 BTC announced last Monday.

On May 5, Zhao shared on X that he had advised Kyrgyzstan to start with Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) when building its national crypto reserve. In 2024, Forbes claimed that Zhao holds about 94 million BNB tokens, or 64% of BNB’s circulating supply. At the time of writing, these tokens are worth about $55 billion.

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

A breakout above $2.18 could invalidate the bearish pattern.

The XRP (XRP) price flashes warning signs as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its daily chart, coinciding with declining network activity. 
XRP descending triangle hints at 45% price drop
The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its late 2024 rally, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line.
A descending triangle chart pattern that forms after a strong uptrend is seen as a bearish reversal indicator. As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks…</span>

                              <span>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained when rollup-based layer-2 platforms should go decentralized, and why “as soon as possible” is not the correct answer.
In a May 5 X post, Buterin said there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang said in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:
“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …</span>

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…</span>

The Indonesian Ministry of Communications and Digital (Komdigi) has halted the Electronic System Operator Certificate Registration (TDPSE) for World and World ID over suspicious activity and alleged registration violations, the ministry announced on May 4.
After the suspension, Komdigi plans to summon World’s local subsidiaries, PT Terang Bulan Abadi and PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara, to provide clarification on the alleged violations, it stated.
According to a preliminary investigation, World’s PT Terang Bulan Abadi was allegedly operating without TDPSE, while PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara — the subsidiary…</span>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…</span>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

BTC price action attempts to hold the yearly open as support after some downside at the weekly close, but bullish perspectives remain intact.

The US Federal Reserve interest rate decision is the key macro event of the week, with Chair Jerome Powell tipped to “move markets.”

Jobless claims and Coinbase earnings add to a mixed bag of potential volatility triggers as recession talk gets louder.

Bitcoin dominance hits 65% for the first time in over four years, but analysis thinks its days are numbered.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News’ Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he’s profiting from the presidency through the memecoin.
“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.
“I haven’t even looked,” Trump admitted.
“But I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”
Trump launched his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he wa…</span>

                              <span>Crypto exchange OKX has brought its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator back online with new security upgrades after it was paused in March to prevent further misuse by the North Korean hacking crew, the Lazarus Group.
OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said in a May 4 statement to X that the DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, will resume with several new features, including a “real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.”
A DEX aggregator is a service that pulls data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers and then presents it to users to assist with trading. Xu says, “OKX Web3 is a browser and search engine for blockchain.”

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.

Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days.

This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day.  
The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery.

The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post.
The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.
During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the pos…</span>

                              <span>When programming, we often need to make conditional judgments and choose to execute different blocks of code based on the result. In many programming languages, the most common way to do this is through the ternary operator. However, Python does not support the ternary operator. Interestingly, two of the most popular emerging languages, Go and Rust, also do not support it!
Why doesn&#x27;t Python support the ternary operator? This article will mainly analyze the process behind Python&#x27;s design of conditional syntax, explaining why it adopted a unique implementation. At the same time, we’ll examine why other languages have also abandoned the traditional ternary operator.
The ternary operator usually refers to ?:, with syntax in the form of: condition ? expression1 : expression2. If the condition …</span>

                              <span>Today, I want to continue speaking about RWA and dive into its pros. So let&#x27;s begin!
The advantages of creating investment instruments on blockchain from a business perspective are:
Cost reduction is achieved by eliminating intermediaries like lawyers, brokers, banks, etc.
Fast and efficient 24/7 trading of assets traditionally traded only during “business hours”.
Lower entry barriers.
Increased liquidity of assets.
Transparency of processes.
For asset owners, investors, and traders, RWA tokenization offers:
Greater accessibility, requiring only an Internet connection and a digital wallet.
Lower transaction fees and commissions.
Reduced risks in trading and asset sharing.
Simplified asset exchange, storage, and management.
Direct trading between buyers and sellers.

                              <span>Introduction to Scroll Restoration in Vue
When building Single Page Applications (SPAs) with Vue, particularly when utilizing libraries like PrimeVue, developers often encounter various challenges, one of which is scroll restoration. For instance, you might be using Vue Router’s scrollBehavior function to restore the scroll position when navigating between routes. However, specific components like PrimeVue TabView can complicate this behavior, particularly when the default active tab is not the first one.
Understanding Scroll Restoration
Scroll restoration is crucial for enhancing user experience, allowing users to return to the exact spot they were viewing upon navigating between different pages. In Vue, this is generally managed within the router’s scrollBehavior function. Here’s a typic…</span>

That’s where UI animation comes in. And for designers, developers, and product teams looking to level up, Ripplix is becoming the go-to destination for UI animation inspiration.

My friend had just executed his code — and it worked perfectly.
So what happened?
He had to log into Gmail on the lab PC
That’s when I had this thought:
Googled and found already existing ones like dontpad
So, for the next couple of weeks, all of us started using dontpad — mostly just copy-pasting code, sharing it as soon as someone got it working. Whoever cracked the problem first would dump the code there, and the rest of us would just grab it and run.
Then one day, I was sitting in class and noticed how our teacher logged into her Gmail just to download a PPT and present it to the class. That moment stuck in my mind — but I got busy with other things and didn’t think much of it.

This guide shows you how to get AI answers *instantly by streaming LLM responses word-by-word, and cut them off anytime, using a simple PocketFlow LLM Streaming Example.*
We&#x27;ve all been there. You ask an AI a question. You wait. Maybe it&#x27;s brilliant, maybe it&#x27;s... weird. What if you could see the answer appear as it&#x27;s typed and hit an &quot;eject&quot; button if it&#x27;s not what you want?
That&#x27;s LLM Streaming (seeing it live) and User Interruption (hitting stop). Instead of getting a whole essay dropped on you, text pops up piece by piece. It feels way faster. Plus, the stop button puts you in charge, saving time and maybe even cash on API calls.

                              <span>In today&#x27;s fast-paced digital landscape, efficient log management is not just a convenience—it&#x27;s a necessity. Logs are fundamental to diagnosing errors, tracking performance, and ensuring the overall health of infrastructure and applications. One of the most effective and scalable solutions for centralized logging is the combination of Filebeat, Logstash, and Elasticsearch, commonly referred to as part of the ELK stack. When used together, they provide a flexible pipeline for shipping, transforming, and storing logs, which can then be analyzed and visualized using Kibana.
This comprehensive guide walks you through a practical setup of Filebeat and Logstash integration, with step-by-step instructions, configuration samples, troubleshooting tips, and best practices to help you get the most o…</span>

Essa comunicação, para mim, sempre foi algo bem diferente — como se fossem mundos que não se comunicam. Às vezes, parece até que estamos &quot;invadindo&quot; um território que seria de BI, Data Science, Analytics...
Mas, se formos olhar o que estamos fazendo enquanto equipe de Observabilidade, nós acabamos sendo &quot;primos&quot; dessas áreas de Dados — talvez até irmãos.
irmãos&quot; dessas áreas, então por que não estamos levando esse sobrenome quando nos identificamos?
não estamos usando estratégias, conceitos **e **gerando insights da mesma forma — ou de uma forma muito parecida — como essas áreas fazem?
Penso em duas coisas quando olho para isso:
Primeiro, e talvez o mais &quot;ofensor&quot;, é a questão de quem fomos. Muitos de nós entramos nessa área, e …</span>

This article will address these common problems when using Sunflower No. 8 data, comparing it with MODIS data that does not exhibit these issues. We will explore the underlying causes and provide step-by-step solutions to rectify these mistakes.
Understanding the Mirrored Image Issue
One common issue users encounter when visualizing data in MATLAB is the &quot;mirrored&quot; image effect. This often happens due to the way that image data is processed when plotted or displayed. In your case, using Sunflower No. 8 data shows an image that is flipped vertically or horizontally, lea…</span>
