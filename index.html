Modern web browsers ship with a growing number of powerful, native JavaScript APIs that let developers build more dynamic, performant, and user-friendly applications — no external libraries required. 
In this post, we’ll explore six of these APIs: structuredClone, EyeDropper,  AbortController, Intersection Observer, ResizeObserver, and the Clipboard API. For each, we’ll explain what problems it solves, when to use it, and how to implement it. Before we dive in, it’s important to know why these APIs aren’t more widely known, despite how useful they are:
  They’re relatively new: Many of these APIs have only been introduced recently. In the meantime, mature and popular npm packages have already become the go-to alternatives

                              <span>The internet has content spanning multiple mediums, formats, and modalities. However, most LLM-based AI applications in the past few years have primarily dealt with text data. This is because embedding models and LLMs, until recently, were focused mainly on text. But this is changing— LLMs like Gemini and GPT-4o can now process and generate images, audio, and video. Vendors like Voyage AI and Cohere have multimodal embedding models that can embed both images and text. This means we are no longer limited to using just text in our LLM applications.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to build a RAG application using documents consisting of interleaved text, images, and tables as their source of knowledge. Specifically, we will cover the following:

A single outage in a banking app can cost millions. 
In early 2025, Barclays experienced a major mobile banking outage, with estimated compensation costs ranging from £5 million to £7.5 million. This shows how disruptions can lead to significant financial and trust consequences.
As more customers shift to mobile-first banking, expectations for speed, uptime, and security continue to rise. Every tap, login, and transaction must work as expected across devices, operating systems, and network conditions.
To meet these demands while staying compliant with strict data privacy regulations, banks are moving toward a more controlled setup: on-premises device labs.
These secure, in-house setups are quickly becoming the preferred approach for testing apps in environments banks can ful…</span>

with-next-sass - This official next.js example demonstrates how to use Next.js&#x27; built-in Global Sass/Scss imports  and Component-Level Sass/Scss modules support.
This stackoverflow answears helped me.
Nextjs has built in sapport for sass. To use component isolated .sass or .scss files you need to install sass.
npm install sass

To configure sass compiler you can use sassOptions in next.config.js. nextjs.org/#customizing-sass-options
For instance, if you want to load assets from styles like @font-face src and have different locations on prod and dev environments, you can do the following:
In next config set assetPrefix depending on the environment. Then, add sassOptions variable.
// next.config.js

module.exports &#x3D; (phase) &#x3D;&gt; {
  // when started in development mode &#x60;next dev&#x60; or &#x60;npm run dev&#x60;
  const isDev &#x3D; phase &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; PHASE_DEVELOPMENT_SERVER;
  // when &#x60;next build&#x60; or &#x60;npm run build&#x60; is used
  const isProd &#x3D; phase &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; PHASE_PRODUCTION_BUILD;

  const assetPrefix &#x3D; isProd ? &#x27;/prod&#x27; : &#x27;/&#x27;;

  const sassOptions &#x3D; {
    prependData: &#x60;$prefix: &quot;${assetPrefix}&quot;;&#x60;,
  }

  ... // Other configuration

  return {
    ...
    sassOptions
  };
}

In .scss files now you can use this prefix variable to prepend import paths.
@font-face {
  font-family: &#x27;Open-Sans&#x27;;
  src: url(&quot;#{$prefix}fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf&quot;);</span>

Make sure you&#x27;re equipped with all the neccesary packages to run GHCup properly. I&#x27;m not gonna list all of them here (if you&#x27;re a dev already, chances are you&#x27;re). 

So just go here and check -&gt; https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/#system-requirements
if you&#x27;re on Arch Linux, you just need the linux-devel and curl packages and rest will be automatically downloaded installed by the GHCup installer.
curl --proto &#x27;&#x3D;https&#x27; --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh

This script will download and install the following binaries:

What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)? if you have not heard about MCP (where have you been?) then check out my colleague&#x27;s post on this, Standardizing AI Tooling with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP server directories are beginning to appear, and we recently published the AWS MCP Server directory that provides an up to date list of specialised MCP servers that help you get the most out of AWS (wherever you use MCP, not just with Amazon Q CLI).

XRP trades over 120% above its realized price, flashing heightened correction risk.

A rising wedge breakdown on the 4H chart could send XRP toward $1.89 by mid-May.

Weekly falling wedge pattern and 50-week EMA support suggest a possible 25% recovery to $2.92 by June.

XRP (XRP) price has rebounded by over 40% in the last three weeks to reach over $2.28 on April 29, but it’s still trading over 30% below its local high of $3.39.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

US DOJ requests 20-year sentence for Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky
Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of the now-defunct cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius, faces a 20-year prison sentence as the US Department of Justice (DOJ) seeks a severe penalty for his role in a multibillion-dollar fraud.
The DOJ on April 28 filed the government’s sentencing memorandum against Mashinsky, recommending a 20-year prison sentence for his fraudulent actions, …</span>

Global CBDC projects have not failed, but they have also not become what they were anticipated to be, according to Olga Goncharova, CEO at the consulting firm Rizz Go and former director of government relations in the Commonwealth of Independent States at Binance.
“CBDCs were conceived as a technological breakthrough, but so far they look like expensive imitations of existing traditional fiat currencies that citizens and businesses already use through online banking and payment apps,” Goncharova told Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Forum in Moscow.

Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin (BTC) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. 
Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Tra…</span>

Your digital identity is the fingerprint you leave across the internet, a living map of who you are.
Your digital identity is more than just your name or email; it stretches from your social media profiles and crypto wallet addresses to your device fingerprints and even the rhythms of your daily browsing habits. In the fast-moving world of cryptocurrency, where identity and financial access often overlap, digital identity theft isn’t just a nuisance; it’s an open door to your assets. 

Without strong protection, even small pieces of stolen information can be stitched into a full profile, giving cybercriminals everything they need to impersonate you, seize your funds or lock you out of your accounts.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price consolidates as the market awaits President Trump’s 100-day speech.

Over $4.7 billion in BTC has been withdrawn from exchanges since April 22, reducing supply and boosting price sensitivity to demand.

Trump’s crypto policy clarity could spark a BTC surge, but tariffs may cap gains.

Traders say Bitcoin price must clear key hurdles above $95,000 before continuing the uptrend to $100,000 and beyond.


Bitcoin’s (BTC) price is consolidating in a tight range between $91,700 and $95,850, ahead of Trump’s 100-day commemorative rally.

Bitcoin supply in profit has climbed back above 85%, nearing the classic euphoric area.

Bitcoin could rally toward $110,000–$115,000 helped by a “max buying” zone.

                              <span>The concept of a Russian ruble stablecoin received special attention at a major local crypto event, the Blockchain Forum in Moscow, with key industry executives reflecting on some of the core features a ruble-backed stablecoin might require.
Sergey Mendeleev, founder of the digital settlement exchange Exved and inactive founder of the sanctioned Garantex exchange, put forward seven key criteria for a potential “replica of Tether” in a keynote at the Blockchain Forum on April 23.
Mendeleev said a potential ruble stablecoin must have untraceable transactions and allow transfers without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.
However, because one of the criteria also requires the stablecoin to comply with Russian regulations, he expressed skepticism that such a product could emerge soon.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates’ largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin, pending regulatory approval, the three companies said on April 28.
The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence.

The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ.

Lawyers for Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill said in an April 28 letter to Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman that they jointly requested with the government “for a continuance of the pretrial motions schedule by 16 days.”
The Samourai executives&#x27; lawyers said on April 10 that they wrote to Acting Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton to request the dismissal of the case after an April 7 memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche shuttered the Justice Department’s crypto team.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while dollar-backed stablecoins may be dominant, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins.
“The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space,” Collins said. “The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it’s not currencies. It’s other types of backing,” he added.
Collins said that other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users.
