While these tools have served us well, they often require manual steps to extract information or lack advanced features. Enter Snippai, an AI-driven screenshot tool that not only captures your screen but also understands and processes the content within.
Snippai is a cross-platform screenshot tool powered by advanced AI algorithms. It&#x27;s designed to transform your screenshots into structured, actionable content. Whether you&#x27;re dealing with mathematical formulas, tables, code snippets, or multilingual text, Snippai can intelligently extract and process this information for you.

Whether you’re at a fork in the road or just getting curious, this series is for you. Week 1 will be about exploring (experimentation, choosing a growth theme), Week 2 we&#x27;ll focus on becoming visible and taking initiative, while the final week is about claiming growth (or moving away) and choosing your own path. Join me on this journey!
For a long time, I thought there were only two choices:
Stay technical: stay “just a dev”
Go into leadership: say goodbye to coding
But that is definitely not the case.
You can lead and still write code.
Some of the best tech leads I’ve worked with still:

As discussed in Part 2, I designed the overall layout of the backend server by creating all the essential endpoints, connecting it to the frontend, and tested it using a mock database.
Now, it&#x27;s time to transition to a real database. Why is a persistent database essential?
Manual Data Updates: With a mock database, data updates are manual and not persistent across sessions.
Scalability Limitations: In-memory arrays become inefficient and unmanageable with growing datasets.
Inefficient Authentication: Each login attempt requires iterating through the entire dataset, which is highly inefficient for real applications.
What We&#x27;ll Cover: The Database Layer

Operational efficiency might sound like corporate jargon, but at its core, it’s about creating systems that deliver value consistently while keeping your team energized. Many businesses get sidetracked by vanity metrics—numbers that look good in reports but fail to reveal the true state of operations. This blog post dives into the real essence of operational efficiency, how to measure it effectively, and the tools to implement for sustainable improvements.
To truly understand operational efficiency, businesses must identify meaningful metrics that correlate with success. Instead of focusing on superficial numbers, such as lines of code written, leaders should track metrics like customer satisfaction and defect rates that directly im…</span>

                              <span>Hello, I am having a persistent build error in a new Android Studio project and I have tried every possible solution.
The error is:
This error happens even though I can physically see the logo.png file inside my app/res/drawable folder. The file name is all lowercase.
I am running Android Studio on a Windows machine. Here is everything I have already tried to fix this:
Verified Code: All my code (activity_main.xml, MainActivity.kt, build.gradle.kts, AndroidManifest.xml) is correct and synchronized.
Clean and Rebuild: I have used Build -&gt; Clean Project and Build -&gt; Rebuild Project many times. The build is successful, but the error appears when I try to run the app.
Invalidate Caches: I have used File -&gt; Invalidate Caches / Restart multiple times.
Manual Deep Clean: I have closed the project, manually deleted the .gradle, .idea, and build folders from my project directory, and then re-opened the project to force a fresh sync.
Complete Reinstallation: I have completely uninstalled Android Studio from my computer, deleted all related settings files, and then performed a fresh, clean installation. I created a brand new project from scratch, and the same error still occurs.
Windows Features: I have enabled both Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Hypervisor Platform and restarted my computer.
Conclusion: The problem seems to be a deep environmental issue on my computer where the Android build tools (AAPT) cannot see or access the resource files, even when they definitely exist. I am out of ideas. Has anyone ever seen this kind of persistent error before?</span>

Mass disruption across international trade routes sparked widespread supply shortages. Costs spiralled. And wild fluctuations in demand rendered tried-and-tested inventory planning and forecasting tools useless. “It was the black swan event that nobody had accounted for,…</span>
