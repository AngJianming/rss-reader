                              <span>Hey everyone 👋
If you’ve ever worked on a coding project with someone else — or plan to — you need to understand Git’s collaboration workflow. At first, it might seem like Git was built only for solo developers keeping track of their own changes. But Git actually has powerful teamwork features, and once you learn the flow, it makes working with others feel smooth and safe.
Let me break down Git Teamwork the way I wish someone had for me 👇
Let’s say you and your teammate Sally are writing science quizzes together.
Instead of constantly emailing files back and forth (we’ve all been there 😅), you each get your own personal locker — a local copy of the project — but you both sync your work through a shared central locker (called a remote repository).
That remote locker usually lives on GitH…</span>

                              <span>The rise of subscription-based business models has transformed how enterprise HR tech platforms operate. While subscription logic might sound straightforward, things get significantly more complex when you&#x27;re dealing with enterprise clients — especially in sectors like HR where billing is directly tied to fluctuating employee data, modular feature needs, and regional compliance.
This post outlines some of the core engineering and architectural challenges in building scalable, customizable subscription plans — particularly for HR SaaS providers — and how development teams can approach them.
Unlike standard SaaS billing, enterprise HR subscription models need to account for:
Constant changes in employee headcount (new hires, exits, transfers)

These accounts represent businesses, funds, and entities with millions in transactional volume and deeply integrated systems. In this post, we’ll break down how corporate accounts differ technically, why they require special treatment, and how developers can design secure yet performant access layers around them.
From a systems design standpoint, a corporate account is not just a user account with a different flag. It’s a high-permission, high-risk, multi-user gateway into institutional-grade finance.
On WhiteBIT, corporate accounts unlock:

                              <span>Problem Statement
While managing a critical production workload on AWS, I noticed that one of our primary EC2 instances (running a multi-tiered web application) was repeatedly hitting 100% CPU utilization during peak hours. This resulted in increased latency, failed health checks, and occasional downtime for end users. The issue was not security-related but was severely impacting application performance and availability.
Initial Investigation
Symptoms: CloudWatch alarms were triggered for high CPU utilization. Users reported slow response times, and the instance occasionally failed AWS status checks.
Baseline Check: I reviewed historical CloudWatch metrics and observed that CPU usage was previously stable, with occasional spikes, but now it was consistently maxing out during business hours…</span>

Whether you prefer a timeless silhouette or something trend-forward, finding the best sunglasses for women means balancing elegance, quality, and UV protection.
Sunglasses do more than shield your eyes from the sun. They protect against harmful UV rays, prevent premature aging around the eyes, and help reduce headaches caused by squinting. High-quality lenses filter out blue light, enhance clarity, and contribute to overall eye health. But for many women, sunglasses are also a signature fashion statement.

                              <span>In the world of microservices and event-driven architecture, orchestrating business workflows is a common challenge. Two popular patterns for managing these workflows are Orchestration and Choreography, each with unique strengths and trade-offs.
In this post, we’ll design a classic use case E-Commerce Order Processing using both patterns, helping you understand how they differ in real world scenarios.
Use Case: E-Commerce Order Processing
Receiving the order


Processing payment


Updating inventory


Scheduling shipping



The flow must ensure consistency; either the entire process is completed, or appropriate compensations occur.
Let&#x27;s examine the states involved in this process. 

How it works:

                              <span>Artificial intelligence has long fascinated us with promises of a world where machines can hear, see, and communicate smoothly with humans across multiple senses. Yet, such bold aspirations typically came with an equally bold price—exclusive hardware demands, inaccessible software licenses, and expensive resources that kept these exciting innovations locked away in research labs and wealthy corporations.
Something remarkable has shifted within the AI landscape. A robust, elegant solution named Qwen2.5-Omni-3B has arrived, offering multimodal capabilities on consumer-grade GPUs. Instead of belonging solely to tech giants, this powerful, open-source technology promises inclusive innovation, opening the doors for developers, startups, educators, and curious enthusiasts everywhere.

                              <span>Outreach is a must if you want to grow your project, get backlinks, or build partnerships. But manually sending personalized emails can take forever.
The good news? You can automate outreach without sounding like a robot—and without losing that personal touch.
Here’s a straightforward approach:
Keep your contacts in a spreadsheet with key info like name, email, website, and any notes you have about them (like their interests or recent projects). This makes personalization easier.
Tools like Lemlist, Mailshake, or others allow you to automate emails while customizing key details like the recipient’s name or recent blog posts. This means your emails still feel personal even when sent at scale.
Start your email by mentioning something specific about the person—like a recent article they wrote, their product launch, or something relevant to their work. This small touch makes a big difference.
Set up a few polite follow-up emails to send if you don’t get a response, but make sure your system stops if they reply. No one likes getting spammed.
Keep an eye on your open and reply rates. Test different subject lines and messages to see what works best.
If you’re comfortable with scripting, you can build simple automations that pull contact info from spreadsheets, generate personalized intros using AI tools, and send emails—all while maintaining control over the process.</span>

Minimal APIs help reduce boilerplate code and are ideal for small services or microservices.
Here’s what I implemented:
CRUD operations for a simple TaskItem model.
Integrated EF Core with a SqlServer database.
Secured the API using JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization.
𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗿𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗲
RouteGroupBuilder taskItems &#x3D; app.MapGroup(&quot;/tasks&quot;);
taskItems.MapGet(&quot;/{id}&quot;, GetTask)
static async Task GetTask(int id, AppDbContext db)
𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲: 𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸
taskItems.MapPost(&quot;/&quot;, CreateTask)
static async Task CreateTask(TaskItemDTO taskItemDTO, AppDbContext db)
db.Tasks.Add(taskItem);
await db.SaveChangesAsync();

taskItemDTO &#x3D; new TaskItemDTO(taskItem);

return TypedResults.Created($&quot;/taskitems/{taskItem.Id}&quot;, taskItemDTO);

}

This approach is clean, fast, and perfect for RESTful APIs.
