Whether you&#x27;re debugging spaghetti code at 2 AM or trying to prevent future you from rage-quitting, SOLID principles are here to help. But let&#x27;s be honest—they’re often taught in the driest way possible.
In this article, I’ll walk you through the SOLID principles using TypeScript, real-world analogies, and some much-needed humor. No jargon. No hand-waving. Just clean, readable code examples you’ll understand and remember.
SOLID is a set of five design principles that make your code:
Easier to maintain


Easier to test


Easier to extend without breaking things



Yet, most explanations feel like they were written by a robot for other robots. That ends now.

If you&#x27;re developing a user login feature in Go and encounter the error sql: expected 15 destination arguments in Scan, not 18, you&#x27;re not alone. This common issue typically arises when there is a mismatch between the number of columns returned by your SQL query and the number of variables to which you are scanning the results. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to fix this error and make sure your user authentication works seamlessly based on an email and password.
Understanding the Error
The error message ‘sql: expected 15 destination arguments in Scan, not 18’ indicates that your SQL query is returning more columns than you are attempting to scan into your variables. In your case, the SQL query is trying to fetch 15 columns from the users table, while the Scan method is set…</span>

Introduction: JavaScript design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. They provide a structured approach to building complex applications, improving code readability, maintainability, and scalability.  Understanding these patterns allows developers to write more efficient and elegant code.
Prerequisites:  A solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including objects, prototypes, functions, and closures, is necessary to effectively utilize design patterns. Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts is beneficial.
Advantages: Design patterns offer several advantages:
Improved code organization: They promote modularity and reduce code duplication.

Additionally, I had the opportunity to present my contributions during the community meeting, where I encouraged others to contribute, provide feedback, and review the documentation.
Asynchronous Options on GKE


I worked on improving the Microcks GKE deployment by adding support for asynchronous protocols and securing the Microcks endpoint with TLS.
Enabled Kafka-based async protocols with Helm and installed Strimzi for Kafka management.
Secured the endpoint using cert-manager and Let&#x27;s Encrypt for automatic SSL certificate provisioning.
Deploying complex systems like Microcks with external Keycloak and MongoDB can sometimes lead to roadblocks. To address this, I created a TROUBLESHOOTING.md file in the repository. This document provides a set of common issues and solutions that developers may encounter when deploying Microcks on GKE, especially when integrating with Keycloak for authentication and MongoDB for data storage.
Troubleshooting Guide
I developed a GUIDELINES.md document that outlines the deployment process for Microcks across multiple cloud providers. The guidelines cover setting up infrastructure, deploying Keycloak, provisioning databases, and configuring Microcks with Helm.
Common Guidelines
Next month, I plan to:
Deploy Microcks on Azure AKS and document the process.
Add a Troubleshooting Guide for Azure deployment.
Month two has been an exciting journey, contributing to Microcks with improvements in deployment, security, and cloud-specific guidelines. I’m excited to continue supporting the Microcks community and look forward to the next steps!
Feel free to check out my contributions on the Microcks community repository  -  feedback and contributions are always welcome!
See you in the next update! 👋</span>

                              <span>Introduction
If you&#x27;re working on a MATLAB-based rocket simulation and encountered a &#x27;divide by zero&#x27; error, you&#x27;re not alone. This issue is common when dealing with dynamic simulations, particularly those involving physics calculations where values can rapidly approach zero. Let&#x27;s explore why this happens and how to resolve it effectively.
Understanding the Divide by Zero Error
The divide by zero error in MATLAB typically arises when a division operation attempts to use zero as the denominator. In rocket simulations like yours, this can occur due to various reasons:
Variable Initialization: Variables like m_fb, m_fb2, or your mass parameters may not have been initialized correctly or are floored at zero during runtime, leading to unexpected zero values in subdivisions.
Dynamic Range: Duri…</span>

Angular&#x27;s learning curve in 2025 remains steeper compared to React and Vue, primarily due to its comprehensive framework nature rather than being a lightweight UI library.

                              <span>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that&#x27;s easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It&#x27;s one of the most widely used formats in web development, especially when working with APIs and server responses.
JSON is a text-based format for representing structured data. It resembles JavaScript object syntax, but it&#x27;s a string.
Example JSON:
{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;,
  &quot;age&quot;: 25,
  &quot;isStudent&quot;: false,
  &quot;skills&quot;: [&quot;HTML&quot;, &quot;CSS&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;]
}

They look similar, but they are different:



Feature
JavaScript Object
JSON




Data Type
Object
String


Can contain functions
Yes
No


Comments
Allowed
Not allowed


Quotes on keys
Optional
Mandatory



JSON.stringify()


Converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
const user &#x3D; { name: &quot;Bob&quot;, age: 30 };
const jsonString &#x3D; JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString); // &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:30}&#x27;

JSON.parse()


Converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object.
const jsonString &#x3D; &#x27;{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;age&quot;:30}&#x27;;
const user &#x3D; JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(user.name); // &#x27;Bob&#x27;

fetch(&#x27;https://api.example.com/data&#x27;)
  .then(response &#x3D;&gt; response.json())
  .then(data &#x3D;&gt; {
    console.log(data); // Parsed JSON object
  });

Most APIs return JSON. Using .json() parses the response body into a JavaScript object.
Forgetting to wrap keys in quotes in JSON:




  { name: &quot;John&quot; } // Invalid

Correct:
  { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot; }

 Using functions in JSON:




  JSON.stringify({ sayHi: () &#x3D;&gt; &quot;Hi&quot; }); // sayHi will be removed

JSON is used for storing and exchanging data.
Use JSON.stringify() to convert objects to strings.
Use JSON.parse() to convert strings to objects.
It’s widely used in API communication.

Bitcoin Satoshi&#x27;s Vision investors attempt to rekindle lawsuit against Binance
A group of Bitcoin Satoshi&#x27;s Vision (BSV) investors is attempting to rekindle a 2019 lawsuit against Binance, alleging that the crypto exchange caused price damage to the altcoin by delisting BSV in 2019.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a previous ruling from the United Kingdom Competition Appeal Tribunal, throwing out the claims of undue damage from the delisting, should be examined again, according to legal outlet Law360.

El Salvador&#x27;s Bitcoin Office has continued its steady pace of Bitcoin acquisitions months after the IMF agreement was signed and shows no sign of halting its Bitcoin purchases.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…</span>

However, less than two weeks later, the imageboard was back online, defiant as ever.
“4chan is back,” an official blog post proclaimed. “No other website can replace it, or this community. No matter how hard it is, we are not giving up.”
The imageboard has left its mark on the world in many consequential ways, birthing countless memes and conspiracy theories, serving as a platform for political movements ranging from the alt-right to Anonymous, and acting as a dumping ground for leaks and hacks of all sorts.

Under the proposed rules, crypto exchanges, dealers, and agents will be regulated similarly to traditional financial firms, with requirements for transparency, consumer protection, and operational resilience, the UK Treasury said in a statement released following Reeves’ remarks.
Per the statement, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025 introduces six new regulated activities, including crypto trading, custody, and staking.

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

According to data from DEX Screener, DOOD’s market cap fell from over $100 million shortly after launch to around $60 million at the time of writing.
Overall, the much-anticipated airdrop was “[d]efinitely underwhelming,” a crypto commentator said in a May 9 X post.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana&#x27;s 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

The discussion could advance institutional interest in the crypto industry.
According to a May 9 memo published by the task force, BlackRock sought to “[d]iscuss perspectives on treatment of staking, including considerations for facilitating ETPs with staking capabilities.” The company has previously said that Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, while successful, are less perfect without staking.
Other crypto ETF issuers share that view. On Feb. 15, the New York Stock Exchange proposed a rule change to introduce staking services for Grayscale’s spot Ether ETFs. In April, the SEC delayed a decision…</span>

According to a May 9 notice from the event’s organizers, Vance will address conference attendees in person on May 28, making him the first sitting US vice president to speak at a digital asset conference. 
Trump provided a pre-recorded video of himself from the White House to the organizers of the Digital Asset Summit in March — his first appearance at a crypto event since taking office in January — and spoke in person at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville while campaigning.
Though Vance is a Bitcoin (BTC) holder — he holds $250,000 to $500,001 worth of the cryptocurrency, according to a financial disclosure filed in…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Revenue fell to $34.4 million from $42.4 million in the same period of 2024, according to the company&#x27;s earnings report, published May 9. Cost of revenue rose sharply to $24.5 million, up from $14.4 million a year earlier.
As a result, TeraWulf&#x27;s cost of revenue accounted for 71.4% of total income from operations in Q1 2025, more than double the 34% recorded in the prior-year quarter. In Q1 2024, the company posted a net loss of $9.6 million.

During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much Ether (ETH) they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: 
“Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it&#x27;s not the case that if you&#x27;re a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”

According to a May 9 Bloomberg report, Democratic senators asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to report on the steps Binance had taken as part of its November 2023 plea agreement with US authorities, amid reports that Trump and his family had deepened connections with the exchange.

In a May 9 X post, ZachXBT said he identified the wallet behind the scam and linked it to an X account that has since been deleted. 
But in 2023, law enforcement detained Sam Curry, a former Yuga Labs security researcher, at an airport as a suspect in the incident, ZachXBT said. Yuga Labs is the company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection. 
“It’s unfortunate to see how a security researcher was detained when stronger leads on a threat actor potentially responsible exist,” ZachXBT said.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

Bitcoin (BTC) reached a high of $103,600 on May 8 after reclaiming $100,000 for the first time since January. Its market dominance also surged above 60%, reflecting more bullish BTC sentiment.

The BTC rise coincided with Trump announcing a trade deal with the United Kingdom, which may include removing a 10% blanket tariff on all imports.

                              <span>Galaxy Digital has been approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to redomicile in the United States, setting the stage for the crypto investment company’s listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Galaxy anticipates listing on the Nasdaq, a tech-focused US stock exchange, by the middle of May, pending approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange, on which the company is already listed, and shareholder approval at a special shareholders meeting on May 9.
Shareholders at the meeting must approve redomiciling Galaxy Digital in the US state of Delaware, known for its business-friendly regulations, before the process can move forward, according to an announcement from the company.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential election.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it&#x27;s also created a blind spot that&#x27;s holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They&#x27;re incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That&#x27;s why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.
