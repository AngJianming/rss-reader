                              <span>Hey everyone 👋
Lately I have been diving into Web3. I started studying about Blockchain and that’s when I wondered why Blockchain was developed 😕and that’s when I read some articles and research paper and found out answer.
In this blog I will tell you the History of Blockchain. So let’s get started 😉
Back in year 1982 cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his dissertation “Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups”. As the name suggests gave the idea of transparent and secure system.
In 1991 Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta developed cryptographically secured chain of blocks. At that time they wanted to build a system in which document timestamps could not be tampered so that no literation can be performed and…</span>

                              <span>When I started learning Go, arrays made sense, fixed-length, type-specific, easy.
“Wait… it looks like an array🤔, but it isn’t? It can grow. What’s the difference?”
If you&#x27;ve asked the same questions, this guide is for you.
🧠 What is a Slice?
A slice in Go is a flexible, growable view into the elements of an array.
It’s built on top of an array, but unlike arrays, slices can change size.
Example:
nums :&#x3D; []int{1, 2, 3, 4}

Here, nums is a slice of integers. You didn’t define how long it should be. Go figure that out.
🔍 The Anatomy of a Slice
Under the hood, a slice has three parts:
Pointer – to the underlying array
Length – number of elements in the slice
Capacity – total space from the starting index to the end of the array




s :&#x3D; []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

                              <span>Bitcoin, the revolutionary digital currency that changed the way we think about money, was born from the vision of decentralization. Artificial Intelligence (AI), on the other hand, is transforming how we process information, automate tasks, and even make decisions. But what happens when these two worlds collide? Could AI someday control Bitcoin? Or are they destined to remain on separate tracks?
Let’s explore the possible future where AI and Bitcoin intersect, and how this could reshape the financial, technological, and even ethical landscape of the crypto world.
AI hasn’t taken over Bitcoin, but it’s already leaving fingerprints:

🧠 Why I Took on the AWS Cloud Resume Challenge
This wasn’t just about putting HTML on S3 — it was about building a cloud-native application with infrastructure as code, CI/CD, serverless architecture, and more.
🔧 Key Components I Used
🖥️ Frontend: HTML + CSS + JS
Includes a real-time visitor counter
Hosted in an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
☁️ Hosting &amp; Security
Cloudflare for:
DNS management (used instead of Route 53)
SSL/TLS encryption
CDN for performance &amp; security
AWS Certificate Manager for HTTPS
🧪 Backend: Visitor Counter (Serverless)
AWS Lambda (Python) function logs visits
DynamoDB stores the visit count
🔁 CI/CD Pipeline
Frontend assets pushed to S3
Backend infrastructure deployed with AWS SAM
🏗️ Infrastructure as Code:
Easy to spin up / tear down environments
🧠 Lessons Learned:
Deploying secure static websites on S3 with custom domains
Setting up Cloudflare for CDN, SSL, and DNS management
Writing serverless functions in Python
Working with DynamoDB (NoSQL) in real-world use
Creating repeatable, testable infra with AWS SAM
Managing secrets, permissions, and roles using IAM
Automating deploys using GitHub Actions
📌 Challenges I Faced:
Lambda permissions (IAM) took some time to get right
Debugging the API Gateway → Lambda → DynamoDB flow
Learning AWS SAM syntax and best practices for modular code
🎯 Final Thoughts
If you&#x27;re learning AWS or prepping for cloud roles, I can’t recommend this challenge enough. You’ll walk away with something tangible, testable, and totally yours.

                              <span>Glassmorphism is one of the most captivating trends in modern UI design — blending blurred backgrounds, transparency, and soft lighting to give elements a &quot;frosted glass&quot; look.
In this article, we’ll build a pure CSS glass card with:
a floating parallax effect,
interactive ripple on hover,
a glowing radial pattern,
smooth entry animation.
And all that — without a single line of JavaScript.

                              <span>At its core, debouncing is a programming practice that ensures a time-consuming function doesn&#x27;t get called too frequently. It works by delaying the function execution until after a certain time has passed since it was last invoked.
Think of it like an elevator: instead of immediately moving after someone presses a button, it waits a few seconds to see if anyone else wants to get on before making the trip.
Before exploring use cases, let&#x27;s implement a simple yet powerful useDebounce hook that you can use throughout your React applications:
import { useState, useEffect } from &#x27;react&#x27;;

function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  // State to store the debounced value
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] &#x3D; useState(value);

Built my first MCP Server for read only Kubernetes operations.
This MCP server was created to provide a secure way to interact with Kubernetes clusters without allowing any create, update, or delete operations. It only exposes read-only APIs to ensure your clusters remain safe while still enabling AI assistants to help you monitor and troubleshoot your Kubernetes resources.
Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been very popular lately and you can see the huge adoption as every company is releasing their official MCP server.
MCP server is the new API endpoint.
Kubernetes is equally popular and there are many Kubernetes MCP servers out there. Security is still evolving around MCP and I didn’t want to run an MCP server for K8s which can create, update or delete my K8s resources.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at Consensus 2025, Carbone argued it is in the best interests of the US to pass comprehensive stablecoin regulations to protect US dollar hegemony in global markets, which has bipartisan appeal and support. Carbone said:
&quot;These things never move as quickly as we want them to move, but it&#x27;s stablecoin legislation. This Congress has already moved more expeditiously than we ever could have imagined. So, yes, it&#x27;s a bump in the road, but I think very, very shortly, we will have another vote.&quot;

Bitcoin refuses to budge from a narrow range as traders consider the likely breakout direction.

Price discovery is keenly awaited, but downside predictions include levels further toward $90,000.

BTC/USD has delivered highly patterned moves since its rebound began in April.

Bitcoin (BTC) kept traders guessing at the May 16 Wall Street open as consolidation sparked both bullish and bearish forecasts.

There are few historical examples of such a massive about-face for an industry, from banks debanking crypto businesses to now embracing stablecoins. If you talk to most crypto startup founders or companies with crypto on the balance sheet, they will all have war stories about finding, applying for and maintaining bank accounts. 
Over the past three years, over half of debanking complaints have been lodged against four American banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citibank. Now, as the policies that discriminated against the crypto industry, like “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and the recision of controversial accounting rule SAB 121, have been repealed, a new openness to blockchain technology from the finance sector is possible.

                              <span>The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation — better known as MiCA — is now in its critical implementation phase. Designed to unify crypto regulation across all 27 EU member states, MiCA promises clarity, consumer protection and long-term market stability. But as implementation begins, cracks are already showing.
In this week’s episode of Byte-Sized Insight, we explore the key provisions of MiCA now in force, particularly around stablecoins, and why some of the largest players in the market are refusing to comply.

As of January 2025, crypto asset service providers (CASPs) began acquiring licenses to operate legally within the EU. A transitional or “grandfathering” period allows existing firms up to 18 months, depending on the member state, to comply. Still, with deadlines app…</span>

Jameson Lopp’s GitHub repository, which logs such incidents, has recorded 22 “$5 wrench” attacks on crypto holders in 2025 alone. The moniker comes from the crude and violent methods perpetrators use to compel crypto holders to hand over their bags. 
In many cases, local law enforcement can intervene before anyone is harmed and funds are lost. But there is a growing trend of increasingly violent and successful attacks, some of which have resulted in permanent harm and even death.

Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected a joint Ripple-SEC motion seeking an indicative ruling on their proposed settlement, according to a filing on May 15.
Ripple’s chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, said the rejection does not reverse the company’s victory in the case. The company announced the end of the lawsuit on March 19.

Alderoty stressed that the latest court decision does not change the fact that XRP (XRP) is not a security, adding that the rejection is related to “procedural concerns with the dismissal of Ripple’s cross-appeal.”

In a May 16 announcement, AsiaStrategy said it is partnering with Sora Ventures to adopt a Bitcoin (BTC) treasury strategy. Sora previously partnered with Metaplanet in 2024 to create Japan’s first corporate Bitcoin treasury.
The stock market took immediate notice of the announcement. Top Win stock closed the trading day at $7.50 on May 15, but traded at $12.12 in premarket at the time of writing — a jump of over 60%.

                              <span>Why did Fantom reinvent itself as Sonic?
Fantom was one of the pioneers of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) design for distributed ledgers. It featured fast finality and transaction fees of a fraction of a cent. However, Fantom relied on the Ethereum-derived account storage model and the EVM, which led to bloated storage and slow execution times.
To address these bottlenecks and implement numerous other updates, the team behind Fantom rolled out Sonic, a fully independent new blockchain network. A new report by HTX  explores Sonic&#x27;s technological background, its new tokenomics model and the innovations it brings to DeFi.

                              <span>Ethereum Merge architect Justin Drake told Cointelegraph that it would be cheaper to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin than on Ethereum.
Drake said it would be “much cheaper to 51% attack Bitcoin” and that it would cost “on the order of $10 billion.”
Drake led work on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) implementation and was a principal architect in the Merge (the full PoS transition event). His remarks echo a May 14 X post by Grant Hummer, the co-founder of Ethereum-focused marketing and product company Etherealize. 
In the post, Hummer said that Bitcoin “is completely screwed because of its security budget.”
Hummer claimed it would cost $8 billion to run a successful 51% attack, and said a successful attack is “virtually certain” when the cost slips to $2 billion. A 51% attack occurs when a si…</span>

XRP price is forming a bullish V-shaped recovery pattern targeting $3.40.

A 53% surge in open interest to $5.06 billion signals bullish sentiment.

XRP (XRP) price shows positive signs as a bullish technical pattern emerges on its weekly chart, coinciding with increasing open interest.
Increasing OI backs XRP upside
XRP price is down 2% over the last 24 hours to trade above $2.40 on May 16, but has gained 13% over the past two weeks as the broader cryptocurrency market recovered and XRP open interest (OI) surged.
The OI surged 53% from $3.61 billion to $5.53 billion between May 8 and May 14, before dropping slightly to $5.06 billion on May 16. Futures OI increasing alongside the price indicates bullish sentiment.

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earned $250 million from its complete exit from crypto-friendly Nubank.

The decision to divest didn’t appear to be performance-based; Nu Holdings posted record profits in 2024 and Q1 2025.

Buffett’s exit aligns with Berkshire’s broader financial sector pullback and growing cash reserve strategy.

Warren Buffett, the legendary investor long known for his skepticism toward cryptocurrencies, has fully exited his position in one of Latin America’s most crypto-friendly banks, Nubank, before his departure from Berkshire Hathaway.

A report from enterprise-grade digital assets platform Fireblocks shows that 90% of institutional players are using or exploring the use of stablecoins in their operations.
The report, published May 15, surveyed 295 executives across traditional banks, financial institutions, fintech companies and payment gateways. Almost half of the respondents (49%) said they already use stablecoins in payments, while 23% are conducting pilot tests and another 18% are in the planning stage.
Only 10% of institutions surveyed said they were undecided about stablecoin adoption.

Bitcoin price consolidates as resistance at $105,000 prevents a rally to new all-time highs.

Traders are slightly bearish, but historical data suggests a sudden bullish move should not be ruled out.


Bitcoin (BTC) price has been consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range over the past seven days as the $105,000 level remains the overhead resistance to break.

Bitcoin unable to crack $105,000
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC’s price has been oscillating between its resistance level at $105,000 and $101,500, where it has found support.
“$BTC is stuck in a narrowing $101.5K–$104K range,” said Swissblock in a May 16 post on X.

“You basically more than quadruple TVL in all of DeFi,” he said, underscoring how the industry is still in its early stages.

XRP is retesting a falling wedge breakout, which could lead to a rally toward $3.60.

Whale wallets are in the red, and history shows this isn’t bullish for XRP price.

A breakdown below $1.11 could trigger an inverse cup-and-handle pattern, targeting a sharp drop to $0.50.

XRP (XRP) has rebounded by more than 50% in the last five weeks to reach $2.42 on May 16. But the price remains 30% below its January 2025 peak of $3.40, raising concerns of a bull trap.
Will XRP’s price sustain the recovery or drop further in the coming days? Let’s examine.

Bitcoin price cycles remain in focus as part of the BTC price “power curve” model.

Eating gold’s market cap could propel BTC/USD to nearly $1 million by the decade’s end.

 
Bitcoin (BTC) has a “decent chance” of hitting $250,000 or more in 2025 as attention turns to gold copycat moves.

Tether AI is an open-source, decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) platform launched by Tether, the company behind the Tether USDt (USDT) stablecoin. Unlike traditional AI services that depend on centralized servers and require application programming interface (API) keys, Tether AI runs on a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) network, offering enhanced privacy, autonomy and resilience. 
Designed to be modular and composable, Tether AI can operate on any hardware, whether mobile, desktop or edge devices, without centralized control or a single point of failure. 
A core innovation of Tether AI is its integration with cryptocurrency infrastructure. It natively supports Bitcoin (BTC) and USDt payments using Tether’s Wallet Developm…</span>

User activity dropped 10% over April, with blockchain gaming reaching a 2025 low of 4.8 million daily Unique Active Wallets, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in the platform’s April Games Report.
Gaming dominance over the decentralized app industry also fell and is now tied with decentralized finance at 21%. 
Gherghelas said it’s clear user attention is shifting away from gaming, but under the surface, new infrastructure went live, major publishers doubled down, and high-quality games edged closer to launch.

                              <span>Jason Guthrie, head of product at asset manager WisdomTree, says he’s optimistic despite a noticeable lack of hype that typically comes along with a crypto bull run. 
There hasn&#x27;t been a “really frothy use case that has typically driven these market cycles previously,” such as initial coin offerings (ICOs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or DeFi lending, Guthrie told Cointelegraph at Consensus. 
“This time, we’ve continued to see the asset class gathering value, we’ve continued to see the companies that are built on this technology, growing revenue, growing client bases, continuing to innovate without really hanging their hat on one of these frankly less than useful use cases,” he said.

The 12 new names, included in a superseding indictment, add to charges originally brought against the main defendant in the case, Malone Lam, on Sept. 19, 2024, the Department of Justice noted in a May 15 statement.
Jeandiel Serrano was named a defendant in the initial indictment but was not included in the superseding one. 
The DOJ said several defendants have been arrested, while two others are believed to be living in Dubai.
Many of the suspects, with aliases like “Goth Ferrrari” and “The Accountant,” come from California, mostly aged between 18 and 22.

On May 16, xAI provided an update on the Grok AI chatbot’s inflammatory responses, stating that on May 14, “an unauthorized modification was made to the Grok response bot’s prompt on X.”
“This change, which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic, violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” it added.
The firm stated that it had conducted a thorough investigation and is implementing measures to enhance the AI chatbot’s transparency and reliability.

“Historic day! Our shareholders have approved, by a wide majority, the transformation of Méliuz into the first Bitcoin Treasury Company listed in Brazil,” Israel Salmen posted to X on May 15.
Salmen said the firm snapped up 274.52 Bitcoin (BTC) for an average purchase price of $103,604, achieving a BTC yield of 600%. 
Méliuz now holds 320.3 Bitcoin, worth a little over $33 million, with the latest purchase adding to the Brazilian fintech firm’s first purchase of 45.73 Bitcoin on March 6.
