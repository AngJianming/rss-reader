                              <span>Over the past few months, I&#x27;ve become increasingly effective at using ChatGPT as a coding partner. My productivity has skyrocketed, and I&#x27;ve been learning new things at a rapid pace.
A few days ago, based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, I downloaded and started using Cursor. I&#x27;ve been playing around with it, and having deep AI integration right in my code editor has been a game changer. The speed at which I can scaffold projects, add features, and iterate has surged once again.
But this has also reinforced a principle that’s already become deeply ingrained in me from my work with ChatGPT:
AI is a powerful tool, but it doesn&#x27;t replace genuine knowledge, skills, and thoughtfulness.
Often, when I ask Cursor to generate code, that code looks polished and impressive — but:

                              <span>Sure! Here’s a clear and concise explanation of React, SPA, MPA, and the difference between ReactDOM and JS DOM:
ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It simplifies the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.
It is developed and maintained by Facebook.
    The latest version of React is React 19.
    Uses a virtual DOM for faster updates.
    Supports a declarative approach to designing UI components.
    Ensures better application control with one-way data binding.
SPA (Single Page Application)
An SPA is a web app that loads one HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app, without refreshing the entire page. React is often used to build SPAs because it efficiently updates the UI on the client side.
MPA (Multi Page Application)
An MPA consists of multiple separate HTML pages. Every time a user clicks a link, the browser loads a new page from the server, causing a full page refresh.
     Each page is a separate HTML file.
     Full reload on navigation.
     Better for SEO and simple websites.

React Components
 Components are building blocks of a React app.
    They are reusable pieces of UI, like buttons, headers, or entire pages.
    Components can be written as functions or classes (functional components are more common now).
Return Function in Components
 A React functional component is basically a function that returns JSX.
    JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript that tells React what to render.
    The value you return from the component is what appears on the screen.
Example:
function Greeting() {




    Here, the Greeting component returns an 
 element.
    React takes that and displays &quot;Hello, world!&quot; on the webpage.</span>

The global energy sector is fundamentally transforming, and Europe is at the epicenter of this shift. By 2030, the European energy storage market is projected to exceed €50 billion, driven by the convergence of advanced technologies and forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. Businesses integrating cutting-edge Energy Management Systems (EMS), next-generation SCADA architectures, and hybrid technologies such as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are well-positioned to lead this revolution.

The European Union has laid the foundation for this transformation with two key regulations set to take effect in 2025:

But what’s often left out is how JavaScript handles inheritance — not through classes (traditionally), but through prototypes.
In this post, we’ll explore:
What prototypes are
proto vs prototype
This prototype object can have its own prototype, forming a prototype chain. The chain ends when a prototype is null.
Think of it like a fallback mechanism: if a property or method isn’t found on an object, JavaScript looks up the chain.

Whether you&#x27;re a beginner or brushing up advanced concepts, this deep dive will clarify how prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance really work. Don&#x27;t miss it!

  🌳 Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree – Explained with Java, Python, and C++ Solutions


By Virendra Jadhav
When working with binary trees, we usually traverse them in pre-order, in-order, post-order, or level-order.\
vertical order traversal introduces a new dimension — literally. Instead of going top to bottom or left to right, we explore the tree column by column.

  No Support for Conditional Types




Rule: arkts-no-conditional-types
Severity: Error
Description: ArkTS does not support conditional type aliases. Introduce new types with explicit constraints or rewrite logic using Object.
TypeScript Example:









type X &#x3D; T extends number ? T : never;
type Y &#x3D; T extends Array ? Item : never;

ArkTS Example:




// Provide explicit constraints in type aliases
type X1 &#x3D; T;

// Rewrite with Object, with less type control and a need for more type checks
type X2 &#x3D; Object;

// Item must be used as a generic parameter and correctly instantiable

                              <span>深入理解Hyperlane的中间件系统：一个大三学生的实践笔记


作为一名大三计算机专业的学生，我在使用 Hyperlane 框架开发校园项目的过程中，对其中间件系统有了深入的理解。今天，我想分享一下我在实践中的心得体会。
graph TD
    A[客户端请求] --&gt; B[认证中间件]
    B --&gt; C[日志中间件]
    C --&gt; D[控制器]

Hyperlane 的中间件采用洋葱模型，请求从外层向内层传递，这种设计让请求处理流程清晰可控。
async fn request_middleware(ctx: Context) {
    let socket_addr &#x3D; ctx.get_socket_addr_or_default_string().await;
    ctx.set_response_header(SERVER, HYPERLANE)
        .await
        .set_response_header(&quot;SocketAddr&quot;, socket_addr)
        .await;
}

相比其他框架需要通过 trait 或层注册中间件，Hyperlane 直接使用异步函数注册，更加直观。
async fn auth_middleware(ctx: Context) {
    let token &#x3D; ctx.get_request_header(&quot;Authorization&quot;).await;
    match token {
        Some(token) &#x3D;&gt; {
            // 验证逻辑
            ctx.set_request_data(&quot;user_id&quot;, &quot;123&quot;).await;
        }
        None &#x3D;&gt; {

                              <span>校园二手交易平台的技术选型：为什么我选择了Hyperlane框架


作为一名大三计算机系的学生，上学期我负责开发了一个校园二手交易平台。在技术选型时，我最终选择了 Hyperlane 这个 Rust Web 框架。今天，我想分享一下这个选择背后的思考过程和实际使用体验。
高并发处理：学期末是二手交易的高峰期，需要处理大量并发请求
实时通信：买卖双方需要实时聊天功能
开发效率：作为学生项目，需要快速开发和迭代
学习价值：希望通过项目深入学习 Rust 语言

#[methods(get, post)]
async fn product_route(ctx: Context) {
    let id &#x3D; ctx.get_route_param(&quot;id&quot;).await.parse::().unwrap();
    // 商品详情查询逻辑
    ctx.set_response_body(format!(&quot;Product {}&quot;, id))
        .await
        .send_body()
        .await;
}

路由宏的设计非常直观，让代码结构更加清晰。
#[get]
async fn chat_ws(ctx: Context) {
    let key &#x3D; ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();
    ctx.set_response_header(CONTENT_TYPE, &quot;application/json&quot;)
        .await
        .set_response_body(key)
        .await
        .send_body()
        .await;
}

原生的 WebSocket 支持让实时聊天功能的实现变得简单。
server
    .enable_nodelay().await
    .disable_linger().await
    .http_line_buffer_size(4096).await
    .run().await;

框架默认的性能优化配置就足以应对校园平台的访问压力。
在普通笔记本上的压测结果：

// 传统框架的写法

// Hyperlane的写法
let method &#x3D; ctx.get_request_method().await;

扁平化的 API 设计大大提高了开发效率。
正则路由参数验证
WebSocket 连接状态管理
数据库连接池优化
在升级到 v4.89+ 时遇到了一些变化：
// 新版本中断请求的方式
if should_abort {
    ctx.aborted().await;
    return;
}

通过仔细阅读更新文档，很快适应了新的API。
API 设计直观：减少了查文档的频率
错误提示友好：编译错误信息清晰明确
性能无忧：默认配置已经够用
文档完善：示例代码可以直接使用
从小项目开始：先实现基本的 CRUD 功能
重视类型系统：利用 Rust 的类型检查避免运行时错误
参与社区讨论：遇到问题多与社区交流
关注性能监控：学习使用性能分析工具
平台已在校内正式运行
日均处理数百笔交易
获得了师生的好评
个人对 Rust Web 开发有了深入理解
计划添加更多社交功能
优化移动端体验
探索微服务架构
尝试贡献社区代码
作为一名学生开发者，我认为选择 Hyperlane 是一个正确的决定。它不仅帮助我完成了项目，还提升了我的技术水平。对于想要入门 Rust Web 开发的同学，我强烈推荐从 Hyperlane 开始！</span>

                              <span>在当前的 Rust Web 框架生态中，Hyperlane 正逐步展现出其作为“新一代轻量级高性能框架”的强大竞争力。本文将通过与主流框架（如 Actix-Web、Axum）对比，全面剖析 Hyperlane 的优势，特别是在性能、特性集成、开发体验和底层架构方面的领先之处。



框架
依赖模型
异步运行时
中间件支持
SSE/WebSocket
路由匹配能力




Hyperlane
仅依赖 Tokio + 标准库
Tokio
✅ 支持请求/响应
✅ 原生支持
✅ 支持正则表达式


Actix-Web
大量内部抽象层
Actix
✅ 请求中间件
部分支持（需插件）
⚠️ 路径宏需显式配置


Axum
Tower 架构复杂
Tokio
✅ Tower 中间件
✅ 需依赖层扩展
⚠️ 动态路由较弱



零平台依赖：纯 Rust 实现，跨平台一致性强，无需额外 C 库绑定。
极致性能优化：底层 I/O 使用 Tokio 的 TcpStream 和异步缓冲处理，自动开启 TCP_NODELAY，默认关闭 SO_LINGER，适合高频请求环境。
中间件机制灵活：支持 request_middleware 与 response_middleware 明确划分，便于请求生命周期控制。
实时通信开箱即用：原生支持 WebSocket 与 SSE，无需第三方插件扩展。
下面我们将拆解一个完整 Hyperlane 服务示例，说明其设计理念与开发者友好性。
async fn request_middleware(ctx: Context) {
    let socket_addr &#x3D; ctx.get_socket_addr_or_default_string().await;
