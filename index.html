Crypto-based bookings on Travala reached $80 million in 2024, up from $45 million the year before. Crypto travelers are also outspending their fiat counterparts, with an average booking value of  $1,211 per transaction, over 2.5 times more than fiat users who spend $469.
Additionally, the report said crypto users were three times more valuable over their lifetime due to longer stays and higher repeat bookings, with crypto travelers 57% more likely to make a repeat hotel purchase.

“We have every expectation now that it’s going to pass,” Sacks told CNBC on May 21, following a key procedural vote that saw 15 Democrats join Republicans to clear the filibuster threshold.
The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the most advanced federal effort yet to establish a legal framework for dollar-pegged digital assets.
Sacks said the bill could trigger “trillions of dollars” in demand for US Treasurys by unlocking stablecoin growth under clear rules.
“We already have over $200 billion in stablecoins — it’s just unregulated,” he added. “If we provide …</span>

                              <span>Newly updated guidelines from Dubai’s crypto regulator include provisions on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and clarify rules for issuers. 
On May 19, Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) released its updated Rulebook for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) operating in the region. The regulator gave market participants until June 19 to comply with the new rules. 
The regulator previously told Cointelegraph that it had enhanced supervisory mechanisms and brought consistency across activity-based rules. One of the more prominent changes includes regulatory clarity on RWA tokens. 
Irina Heaver, partner at the United Arab Emirates-based law firm NeosLegal, told Cointelegraph that the updated rules clarify RWA issuance and distribution.

Bitcoin all-time highs matter little to those seeing a BTC price correction as long overdue.

Both the latest surge and the bull market itself are on borrowed time, traders say.

Comparisons to previous price cycles remain in use despite the booming institutional investment scene.

Bitcoin (BTC) traders are calling for a pullback after all-time highs and seven “green” weekly candles.
BTC price momentum continues to be met with skepticism as commentators assume that lower levels will come next.
BTC price roadmap prepares for Q4 “cycle peak”
Bitcoin hit its highest-ever levels this week, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView confirmed — but despite being up by a third in Q2 already, BTC/USD remains unconvincing for many.

                              <span>What is shilling in crypto?            
            
                
At its core, shilling is the act of artificially promoting a cryptocurrency or token, often with exaggerated claims, to increase its price or popularity. 
But what’s the goal? 
Hype it up, get others to buy in, and then cash out, leaving latecomers holding the bag.
Shilling can come from anyone: influencers, anonymous accounts or even high-profile figures with political or financial clout. The common thread is manipulation: It’s not about educating you or building real value but pumping hype for personal gain.
Unfortunately, the line between enthusiastic promotion and outright deception can be thin, and many fall victim without realizing it. That’s why it’s critical to learn how to spot the signs early.

                              <span>Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance has reportedly endorsed the creation of a dedicated body to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure in the country.
The Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) will serve as a regulatory body to oversee licensing, regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenized platforms, stablecoins and decentralized finance applications, according to a May 21 report from the state-owned broadcaster, PTV.
Muhammad Aurangzeb, federal minister for finance and revenue, told the broadcaster, “Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up, but to lead” in the industry.
“With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” he said.

Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton claimed Jordan-Jones “touted his company as a groundbreaking blockchain startup,” but alleged that, in reality, the “company was a sham, and investors’ funds were siphoned off to bankroll his lavish lifestyle.”

IBIT also saw its largest volume day since January, according to the ETF tracking X account Trader T.

Synthetix said on May 14 that it would acquire Derive in a token exchange deal, pricing 1 SNX token to 27 DRV tokens, which would value Derive at around $27 million, pending approval from both communities.

For example, my VIP costs $5, and SVIP costs $10. When upgrading from VIP to SVIP, the user should only pay the price difference of $5.  
Should I:  
Create a dedicated &quot;price difference&quot; product for this case?


Pass a fixed discount code when creating the order?

Or is there another approach to handle this?

                              <span>Finally, Let Me Clear This Up Once and for All
What we call programming is really just manipulating computer memory


Now, a programming language is a tool humans designed



But in other languages I can just say:
Assembly language was created so that we don’t forget the name of a variable in memory addr... Instead of memorising the addr we can store it as short addr...
Other languages I believe later tried to simplify the process...
But here’s the twist
Computers only understand 1 and 0 while humans understand sentences better than numbers.
(E.g. if I ask you to memorise 1011011... it becomes hard.
Goal is to write sentences (syntax) that we can remember.
Also, programming languages themselves need to be understood by the computer.
And guess what?
Those compilers and interpreters are themselves programs—written in other programming languages (e.g. C++ or C)!
That is...
This creates a fascinating cycle
Programs to write programs that write programs.
Each layer builds upon the previous, hiding the complexity just so that humans can create increasingly powerful software without dealing with the tiniest detail of the hardware.
So, when you ask...
The answer is: Humans did.
At the end of the day...
It speeds up our development of a project.</span>

If you’ve ever rebuilt the same button or dropdown three times — once for React, once for Angular, and again for Vue — you already know the pain of UI fragmentation.
That’s exactly what inspired me to write this in-depth piece on HackerNoon:
Web Components: Build UI Kits for All UI Frameworks

AND to distill all my expertise into a Udemy online course:
Web Components: The Ultimate Guide from Zero to Hero

Web Components are not “just another tech.” They’re a native browser standard — meaning:
With Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, and Slots, you can encapsulate logic and styles while keeping your UI reusable across multiple projects — even if your teams use completely different stacks.

Think of HTML as the skeleton of a web page. It tells the browser:
What text to display
Where to place images, videos, or links
How content is organized (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.)
How HTML Works in the Browser
You Write HTML Code
You Open the File in a Browser
The Browser Parses the HTML
, and  sections.

The Browser Builds the Page
It displays content (like text, images, and videos) inside the

It applies styles from CSS (if linked or embedded).
It runs JavaScript for interactivity (if included).
Result: A Visual Web Page

🌟 The problem? Font sizes in React Native don’t scale by default.
In this article, I’ll walk you through how to fix that once and for all using:
A simple responsiveFontSize() utility,

                              <span>Hello DEV community!
After months of work, I’m excited to share my open-source project websocket-cross-server-adapter — a WebSocket distributed communication framework built on top of Node.js’s native ws module. This framework is designed to enable seamless collaboration across multiple servers and meet the high concurrency demands of real-time applications.
Whether you’re working on multiplayer real-time games, high-concurrency business systems, real-time collaboration, chat, or microservices event delivery, WebSocket distributed architecture remains a core challenge.
This lightweight yet feature-rich framework solves these challenges by:
Extending ws with heartbeat detection, automatic reconnection, message callbacks, and room management

Using Redis Pub/Sub to synchronize messages efficiently across multiple nodes

Providing a unified front-end and back-end protocol, purely in JavaScript

Supporting both standalone and distributed deployment without requiring changes to business logic

Featuring a simple architecture with only two core classes for easy and flexible extension




  
  
  Suitable scenarios



Multiplayer real-time game servers

Real-time chat and collaboration applications

Microservices event bus and cross-service communication

Any system requiring cross-server WebSocket message synchronization



The project includes detailed documentation, example code, and a complete API reference for quick onboarding.
You can check it out here:  
npm: websocket-cross-server-adapter

GitHub: LiuYiSong/websocket-cross-server-adapter



I’m actively developing this project and warmly welcome everyone to try it out and provide valuable feedback or suggestions. Your input will help improve and refine the framework!
Looking forward to building a more stable and efficient distributed WebSocket communication solution together!</span>

No error codes you can trust
Docs that forgot half the parameters
Rate limits? Surprise!
Versioning? What versioning?
I get it — MVPs move fast. But when did “just hit the endpoint and pray” become an acceptable dev experience?

What’s your personal API design rule you wish more teams followed?
Or even better — what’s the most elegant API you’ve ever worked with?</span>

In today’s digital landscape, email security is critical. External emails pose risks such as phishing, malware, and social engineering attacks. Adding a security disclaimer to external emails in Microsoft Exchange Online helps alert users to exercise caution when interacting with messages from outside your organization. This guide provides a step-by-step process to create a transport rule (mail flow rule) in Exchange Online that appends a customizable security message to all incoming external emails. By the end, you’ll enhance user awareness and reduce risks associated with external communications.

Here is what do they have in common :
Both are frontend web tools
Both aim to &quot;make web UI snappy like React&quot;, without using any React-like framework
Both tries to respect the web &quot;as it is&quot;, avoiding un-necessary JS layer
Both play with plain old HTML render (like Laravel, Rails or Django)
Both are born inside a Ruby-on-Rails based company
Now here is how Unpoly and Hotwire complexity compares, and why I think Unpoly is so far the best front-end tool, at least in terms of low-tech and low-complexity.
I&#x27;m not a good drawer I know, but here is the idea :
Hotwire is far simpler than React.
But Unpoly is even simpler.
However, if you try to go back to plain old vanillaJS/jQuery, you end up with a complexit…</span>

The VanEck PurposeBuilt Fund, available only to accredited investors, aims to invest in liquid tokens and venture-backed projects across Web3 sectors, including gaming, financial services, payments, and artificial intelligence. 
Idle capital will be deployed into Avalanche (AVAX) real-world asset (RWA) products, including tokenized money market funds, VanEck said.

                              <span>A New York jury found Braden John Karony, the former CEO of cryptocurrency company SafeMoon, guilty of three felony charges after less than a day of deliberation.
According to May 21 reporting from the courtroom, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, a jury convicted Karony of conspiracy to defraud the United States, money laundering and wire fraud. Prosecutors and defense lawyers presented their cases over the roughly two-week trial that kicked off with jury selection on May 5.

Karony, former chief technology officer Thomas Smith and Kyle Nagy, the platform’s creator, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of SafeMoon’s SFM token. Smith testified against Karony at trial, while Nagy reportedly fled to Russia and was at large as of May 21.
The criminal trial involving a cryptocurrency company executive was seen by many as a bellwether for how Joseph Nocella, the interim US Attorney for the district, would handle cases involving digital assets and fraud. Nocella, a Donald Trump appointee, took office on May 5.

At the time of publication, it was unclear when Karony would return to court for sentencing. He could face years in prison for his role in the fraud at SafeMoon. Smith, who reportedly entered a guilty plea as part of a deal with prosecutors, could receive a lighter sentence.
Karony’s trial followed a sentencing hearing for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky in the Southern District of New York, where a judge ordered him to prison for 12 years after a guilty plea. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who pleaded not guilty and went to trial, was sentenced to 25 years after a 2023 verdict.

                              <span>Key takeaways: 

Bitcoin’s $109,458 all-time high aligns with seven consecutive green weekly candles since April, highlighting the strength of the current bullish momentum.

Analysts expect BTC to reach between $135,000 to $320,000 in 2025.

BTC heatmaps show high-leverage zones that may trigger liquidations. Thus, risk management remains crucial.

Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $109,458 on Binance on May 21, marking seven consecutive green weekly candles in a row since the price bounced from its swing low of $74,500.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and low leverage suggest the BTC rally has room to grow.

US Federal Reserve liquidity and weak bond sales support a Bitcoin push beyond $110,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to sustain its bullish momentum after reaching a new all-time high of $109,827 on May 21, which led traders to question whether derivatives markets mainly drove the rally. From a broad perspective, the $77 billion in Bitcoin futures open interest has undoubtedly played a role. However, a closer look at the data shows a more positive outlook for further price gains.

According to the filing submitted by legal firm Latham and Watkins LLP, 69,461 Coinbase users were compromised by the breach, 217 of whom are residents of the US state of Maine.
The document also indicates the breach occurred on Dec. 26, 2024, but was only discovered on May 11, 2025 — nearly six months following the cybersecurity incident.

Bitcoin made a new all-time high, but the bulls will have to sustain the higher levels for the momentum to pick up.

Several altcoins have bounced off their respective support levels, signaling a positive sentiment.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to maintain its positive momentum and surge above $200,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to a new all-time high on May 21 on easing macroeconomic fears and continued inflows into the US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Analysts expect the momentum to continue and Bitcoin to surge to $200,000 by the end of the year.

Bitcoin (BTC) might be approaching the final stage of its current market cycle — a dramatic final rally followed by a sharp correction and, eventually, a bear market. For many, this could be the long-awaited climax of the past four years, and major players are preparing accordingly.
