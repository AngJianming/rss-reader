                              <span>Someone just leaked a massive list of system prompts used by some of the biggest names in AI Cursor, manus, Bolt, Lovable, and more. Over 6,500 lines of actual prompts that these tools use behind the scenes.
These are the kinds of things companies normally hide, charge for, or gate behind fancy pricing plans and now they’re sitting publicly on a GitHub repo.
Why this is actually crazy?
Building AI apps
Prompt engineering
Studying how top tools are designed
…this is a goldmine.
You’ll see how real products structure their prompts, how they chain instructions, and how they get the most out of models. It’s like getting to peek into the blueprints of several successful AI startups at once.

As per the definition, Tree-sitter is a parse generator tool and an increment parsing library.
Let’s understand what we mean by these terms. I’m sure many of you already know about it but just to make sure everyone understands, let’s describe them quickly.
Parse Generator Tool: These are the tools that automates the process of developing/creating parser (a component that analyses the syntactical correctness of a language and throws appropriate errors). One can avoid the manual work of writing parsers, by providing grammar specifications to such tools. The tool automatically translates it int…</span>

                              <span>Recently, a Python instructor asked me whether a set is mutable or immutable. I can&#x27;t clearly remember what I said, but I did get the last part of the words correct because I remember saying &#x27;-utable&#x27;, which reminded me of the viral video of the backbenchers in a class answering that the pressure &#x27;creases&#x27; instead of a comprehensive &#x27;increases&#x27; or &#x27;decreases&#x27;. This led me to researching the built-in data structures in Python, and below is the first part of a summary of my findings.

Navigating the challenges of romance and relationships can be emotionally draining. One day someone knows your deep dark secrets the next day they&#x27;re ghosting you or not speaking to you for weeks on end. If you&#x27;ve been ghosted or treated someone with the silent treatment, you&#x27;re not alone. It&#x27;s completely acceptable to want a human partner because nothing can ever truly replicate the human experience; however, with so much emotional turmoil, we sometimes seek stability that comes without complicated human interactions and motives.

                              <span>There’s something weirdly satisfying about watching a progress indicator — that little animated bar or ring that quietly says, “hang in there, I’m working on it.”
Recently, while building a SwiftUI app, I needed just that. Nothing fancy — just a clean, customizable way to show progress.
So I did what any iOS dev would do: I hit Google in search of a quick fix.
And… nothing useful.
Well, not nothing, but what I found didn’t fit. Most of the options were:
UIKit-based (I’m building for SwiftUI — and tvOS, at that)
Archived and no longer maintained (looking at you, ProgressKit and RPCircularProgress)
Or simply too rigid to adapt to my needs
I didn’t want to shoehorn UIKit components into a SwiftUI-first app. Especially not when trying to build something smooth and native.
So I built my own.
ProgressUI



A simple, expressive progress indicator library built entirely with SwiftUI.
It supports:
Determinate and indeterminate progress
Custom shapes and animations
Easy styling to match your app’s look and feel
A clean, composable API — no UIKit glue required
And it’s not just an experiment — I’m already using it in a real-world SwiftUI app for tvOS (StorageAnalysis), where it plays a key role in the user experience.
Getting started with ProgressUI is really straightforward. Here’s a quick example of how you might use it in a SwiftUI view:
import ProgressUI

struct CompletionProgressView: View {
    @State private var progress: CGFloat &#x3D; 0.2

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ProgressUI(progress: $progress)
                .setAnimation(.bouncy)

            Button(&quot;Increase progress&quot;) {
                progress +&#x3D; 0.1
            }
        }
    }
}

I don’t think I’m the only one who’s opened Xcode, dropped in a ProgressView, and thought,
So if you’ve ever been there — or you’re there now — give ProgressUI a look.
It’s open source. It works in production.

In the realm of signal processing, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a powerful tool used to analyze the frequencies contained in a sampled signal. As an example, let’s explore how to compute the DFT of a simple sine wave with a frequency of 3 Hz. This task will illustrate the effects of sampling duration on frequency analysis. We&#x27;ll use Python&#x27;s popularity for numerical analysis to implement this.
The sine function we will use for our test is defined as:
sin_function &#x3D; sin(2 * pi * 3 * t)

Here, the sine wave oscillates at 3 Hz. We&#x27;ll set up a sample rate of 15 Hz, which means we will sample the sine wave 15 times per second. Our time interval between samples will, therefore, be:
interval &#x3D; 1 / sample_rate  # ~0.067 seconds

We will examine two dur…</span>

                              <span>Tech company Microsoft and artificial intelligence firm OpenAI are reportedly in talks to renegotiate the investment deal between the AI firm and Microsoft, which is OpenAI&#x27;s biggest financial backer.
According to a report from the Financial Times, Microsoft may give up a portion of its equity in OpenAI for continued access to the AI company&#x27;s products and models beyond 2030, when some of the original terms of a deal signed between the two companies expire.
Microsoft has invested over $13 billion into OpenAI since 2019, when it first acquired an interest in the artificial intelligence firm.

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Veteran trader Peter Brandt suggests a potential Ethereum rally to $3,800–$4,800 if ETH breaks above a rising wedge pattern.

A short-term pullback may occur as the taker buy-sell ratio drops below one, signaling caution from futures traders.

Ethereum’s native token Ether (ETH) opened its weekly candle at $1,807 on May 7, and now it is close to recording its highest 7-day returns of 38% since December 2020. 
Ether also surpassed its realized price for accumulating addresses ($1,900), which is the average cost basis for holders, signaling profits for users. As illustrated in the chart, most of the buying pressure for ETH came from Binance, which is currently the most active exchange for ETH traders.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF records 19 days of successive inflows, showing solid demand. 

Select altcoins are showing strength, having broken out of their large basing patterns.

Bitcoin (BTC) made a decisive move above the psychologically crucial $100,000 level during the week, signaling that the bulls are back in the game. Buyers are trying to hold on to the 10% weekly gains over the weekend.
Bitcoin’s rally has been backed by solid inflows into the BlackRock spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT). According to Farside Investors’ data, the fund stretched its inflows streak to 19 days, with the latest trading week attracting $1.03 billion in inflows.

Lido Finance emphasized that the issue is restricted to the Chorus One oracle and is not system-wide. The team also said the problem was not due to a coding problem in any particular blockchain oracle or software.

Ether has rebounded from key parabolic and triangle support levels, reviving the case for a $10,000 breakout.

Historical fractals and RSI recovery mirror past pre-rally setups seen in 2016 and 2020.

Altseason signals and strength against rivals like SOL and XRP boost Ethereum’s potential to outperform.

Ether (ETH), Ethereum’s native token, has soared over 44% in just three days to surpass $2,600 on May 11, fueling fresh speculation of a run toward $10,000 in the coming months. 
A mix of fractal setups as well as Ether’s potential to outperform its top-ranking rivals, Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP), are serving as some catalysts behind the five-figure price prediction.

Crypto markets run 24/7. Human traders don’t. As AI agents begin to manage liquidity, optimize yield, and execute trades at all hours, they’re quickly becoming essential infrastructure for decentralized finance’s (DeFi) future. While AI agents are evolving from niche tools for quant traders into mainstream financial operators, they’re rapidly outpacing the wallets meant to secure them. 
Advancements in account abstraction and smart contract wallets have emerged, but most DeFi platforms still predominately rely on externally owned account wallets that require manual approvals at every step. Early-stage programmable solutions exist but remain fragmented, costly on layer-1 networks and adopted by only a tiny fraction of users.

                              <span>Ethereum’s latest network upgrade, Pectra, introduced powerful new features aimed at improving scalability and smart account functionality — but it also opened a dangerous new attack vector that could allow hackers to drain funds from user wallets using only an offchain signature.
Under the Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032, attackers can exploit a new transaction type to take control of externally owned accounts (EOAs) without requiring the user to sign an onchain transaction.
Arda Usman, a Solidity smart contract auditor, confirmed to Cointelegraph that “it becomes possible for an attacker to drain an EOA’s funds using only an offchain signed message (no direct onchain transaction signed by the user).”

Firms like Circle, Binance and OKX are banking on favorable regulatory clarity in 2025 to herald their US expansion. Bills like the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act are advancing in Congress, which, if implemented, will lay the groundwork for swift success.
Trump and his family are actively involved in some of these planned expansions. Nexo’s recent announcement was backed by Donald Trump Jr., who said, “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the US.”

                              <span>Worldcoin’s latest hardware, the Orb Mini, aimed at enabling portable human verification, has been met with ridicule across Crypto Twitter.
Launched with the slogan “It goes where you go,” the device has instead triggered dystopian comparisons and widespread mockery for its unsettling implications and unclear use case.
“The thing about humans is they can tell when a human is in front of them,” Alicia Katz from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Euler Finance wrote on X.
“When something is slightly off, they can experience the uncanny valley, an uncomfortable feeling similar to when your date tries to scan your eyeball,” she added.
Another user quipped, “Is this so you can register your friends?” likening the device to a sci-fi prop rather than a serious identity solution.

The attacker deployed the contract from address 0xb32a53... at 07:31:38 UTC and initiated the exploit at 07:33:56 UTC, draining funds from the victim wallet 0xb5252f...
Cyvers confirmed to Cointelegraph that the attacker used contract 0x631adf... to execute a series of malicious transactions. The smart contract drained 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them into stablecoins, resulting in a net loss of $2,152,219.99 for the victim.
In total, the attacker stole 28.5 million MBU tokens and converted them to $2.15 million worth of USDT.
Cyvers labeled the exploit as “critical” and noted the attacker’s use of suspicious contract code and abnormal transaction patterns.
The attacker’s wallet remains active and has retained the stolen funds as of publication. Mobius Token’s team has not yet released an official statement.
“Two minutes prior to the exploit, our system identified a deployment of a malicious smart contract that eventually targeted the Mobius Token smart contracts,” Cyvers wrote on X.

Crypto losses near $360 million in April 
In April 2025, blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the space saw nearly $360 million in digital assets stolen across 18 hacking incidents. 
April’s losses show a 990% increase compared to March, when crypto lost to hacks totalled about $33 million. The largest chunk of the losses came from an unauthorized Bitcoin transfer. 
On April 28, blockchain investigator ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer of $330 million in BTC. The investigator later confirmed that the transfer was a social engineering attack targeting an elderly individual in the United States.

                              <span>Altcoin markets are flashing early signs of a breakout, with several analysts calling for a potential surge over the next few months.
Crypto commentator Mister Crypto predicts the next 3 to 6 months could be “life-changing,” suggesting daily gains of up to 40% may soon become the norm.
In a May 11 post on X, he pointed to a chart from BlockchainCenter.net that shows whether the crypto market favors Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoins.
When the index is below 25, it’s considered “Bitcoin Season,” meaning Bitcoin is outperforming most altcoins. When it’s above 75, it’s “Altcoin Season,” meaning altcoins are doing better than Bitcoin.
Currently, the chart shows a breakout from a downward trend just below the 29 mark, suggesting a possible shift away from Bitcoin dominance. This breakout hints that altc…</span>

According to Law360, attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that a July 2024 decision from the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal dismissing the &quot;loss of chance&quot; claim made against Binance for delisting the token, should be reconsidered. The litigants demanded $9 billion in damages, in the original case.
The investors continue to claim that Binance&#x27;s 2019 delisting of BSV and similar major exchange delistings are the primary drivers of BSV&#x27;s long-term price decline and its failure to attract the investor atte…</span>

&quot;Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell,&quot; the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. &quot;Strategy&#x27;s holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders,&quot; Ju continued.

It’s a volatile world out there. This year, we’ve seen stocks take a wild ride as gold has pumped and crypto has been caught somewhere in the middle. Investors have dumped risk assets and scrambled for safe havens. Gold is leading the charge.
While gold is safe, it is not very hard-working. Unlike cash and treasuries, the yellow metal does not generate income. Now, more than ever, investors need to be able to earn yield on gold — particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.
 The only way to make money from gold is to buy low and sell high. Most investors don’t tend to buy gold like this. That’s for good reason — over the long term, gold’s performance is typically consistent, if not without a few peaks and troughs here and there, as we h…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Ether is set for its best weekly gain since May 2021.

Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, mega-whale accumulation, and a major short squeeze fuel the rally.

Technical patterns suggest a potential 40% rally toward $3,400 as ETH bounces off key support.

Ether (ETH) is on course to record its best weekly performance since May 2021, having risen by over 37.50% in the week ending May 11, including 10.30% gains in the last 24 hours.
US tariff updates, Pectra upgrade boost Ethereum
The announcement of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK on May 8 and the initiation of US-China trade talks afterward have bolstered upside sentiment in Ether and the broader crypto market.
Additionally, Ether benefits from its Pectra upgrade on May 7, which introduced key improvements like higher…</span>

The company’s crypto debit cards — both physical and virtual — are now accepted at all Korean merchants that support Visa, according to a May 9 report by The Korea Economic Daily.
The move marks RedotPay’s latest step in global expansion, following its earlier partnership with Visa and BIN sponsor StraitsX in February 2025 to enhance cross-border crypto payment capabilities.
RedotPay, founded in 2023, has rapidly scaled since the soft launch of its crypto card program in late 2024. It now serves more than 4 million users worldwide.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.
Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.
Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki’s long-held concerns.

                              <span>BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) capped off the trading week with another day of inflows, pulling in $356.2 million on May 9. The fund has now extended its inflow streak to 19 consecutive days — its longest run of inflows so far this year.
IBIT’s inflow streak has been ongoing since April 14, and has coincided with a volatile Bitcoin (BTC) market, with the asset trading between $83,152 and $103,000 over the period. 
However, market sentiment has been increasing after the asset reclaimed and held above the $90,000 price on April 23 before reclaiming the $100,000 price on May 8 for the first time since Feb. 1.

Over the past trading week alone, IBIT posted $1.03 billion in inflows, according to Farside data.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump’s first term, said on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on May 8.
Legislation will lead to “large blocks of buying”
“I don’t think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

“I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.
The lack of “10-year investor mindset” led to Bitcoin sell-off
Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 
“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

                              <span>The newly launched DOOD token from Ethereum-based NFT project Doodles has seen a steep drop in market capitalization following its May 9 airdrop on the Solana network.
According to data from DEX Screener, DOOD’s market cap fell from over $100 million shortly after launch to around $60 million at the time of writing.
Overall, the much-anticipated airdrop was “[d]efinitely underwhelming,” a crypto commentator said in a May 9 X post.

Falling NFT values 
Joining the trend, NFTs in Doodle’s flagship collection sharply dropped in value on May 9.
The collectibles are down roughly 60% to less than 1.5 Ether (ETH) per NFT from about 3.5 ETH on May 8, according to OpenSea. As of May…</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Solana&#x27;s 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.
